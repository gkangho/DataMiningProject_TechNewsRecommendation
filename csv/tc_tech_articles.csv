How about an airbag for your knee?
That’s what former basketball hopeful Kylin Shaw is working on with his startup, Hippos Exoskeleton — a “knee sleeve” that measures stress on the knee joint and inflates around the knee to protect it from major injuries like ACL and MCL tears. The sleeve inflates in 30 milliseconds, which the company says is faster than the 60 milliseconds it takes for ACL tears to occur.
“I, myself, have loved basketball since I was six years old, and for the next decade, it became my entire life,” Shaw told TechCrunch.
“I dedicated myself to intensive training… But at 17, just as I was preparing for a professional basketball career and NCAA trials, I heard a sickening pop from my knee while landing from a dunk,” he said.
The injury ended Shaw’s sporting career prospects, but it gave him the idea to combine AI-driven sensors and a “knee-bag.” He dropped out of the London School of Economics to develop it.
Hippos said the brace uses predictive AI to detect risky movements in real-time and deploys airbags around the knee, potentially saving athletes thousands in medical expenses.
Shaw and his co-founder Bhavy Metakar (CTO) initially bootstrapped Hippos by investing $1,000 of their savings to develop a prototype and generate initial pre-orders from clinics and athletes. The startup has now raised a $642,000 pre-seed round from investors Possible Ventures and Silicon Roundabout Ventures.
Shaw told Techcrunch the company has already secured “over six figures in pre-orders,” and would use the new funding to develop the product further and push to a full launch in around three months.
He said the eventual unit would cost around $129 and come with a $29/month to $99/month subscription plan covering AI-driven insights, small air canisters, and workout tracking.
The startup has performed trials with U.K. football clubs as well as with star athletes, like world skiing champion Alex Schlopy of the U.S. Ski Team. In a statement, Schlopy said: “I’m impressed by the preventative function and it feels so light and comfortable! This brace gives me a sense of psychological safety.”
Beyond elite athletes, Shaw said the product could be used for injury prevention for anyone else, such as those in construction jobs or the elderly.
Hippos may well be pushing at an open door. While approximately 150,000 ACL injuries are reported in the United States each year, and 8.6 million globally among adults, those stats don’t include injuries among children. Also, most health solutions focus on rehabilitation rather than prevention.
Moreover, existing companies addressing joint protection in sports and rehabilitation focus on traditional supportive devices or post-injury support.
Brands in this space include Enovis’ DonJoy (orthopedic braces and supports), ExoKinetics’ Zeen (devices primarily for rehabilitation), and Shock Doctor (sports braces and protective gear for injury management). None of these solutions offer predictive or reactive technology in the way the Hippos air-bag does.
Also participating in the round were Huggingface’s co-founder and CSO, Thomas Wolf; Wayve’s co-founder Amar Shah, and Dr. James Brown, the lead sports medicine doctor at UK Athletics."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/indian-news-agency-sues-openai-alleging-copyright-infringement/,Indian news agency sues OpenAI alleging copyright infringement | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-11-19,"One of India’s largest news agencies, Asian News International, has sued OpenAI in a case that could set a precedent for how AI companies use copyrighted news content in the world’s most populous nation.
Asian News International filed a 287-page lawsuit in the Delhi High Court on Monday, alleging the AI company illegally used its content to train its AI models and generated false information attributed to the news agency. The case marks the first time an Indian media organization has taken legal action against OpenAI over copyright claims.
During Tuesday’s hearing, Justice Amit Bansal issued a summons to OpenAI after the company confirmed it had already ensured that ChatGPT wasn’t accessing ANI’s website. The bench said that it was not inclined to grant an injunction order on Tuesday, as the case required a detailed hearing for being a “complex issue.”
The next hearing is scheduled to be held in January.
“We take great care in our products and design process to support news organizations,” an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement. “We are actively engaged in constructive partnerships and conversations with many news organizations around the world, including India, to explore opportunities, listen to feedback, and work collaboratively.”
The lawsuit adds to mounting global pressure on AI companies over their use of copyrighted material. OpenAI currently faces over a dozen similar lawsuits in the US, two in Canada and one in Germany, according to statements made in court.
OpenAI’s counsel Amit Sibal defended the company’s practices, arguing that copyright laws don’t protect facts and that ChatGPT allows websites to opt out of data collection. The Microsoft-backed firm has no servers in India and maintains that the suit lacks jurisdiction, he added.
ANI’s lawyer, Sidhant Kumar of law firm UNUM Law, countered that public availability doesn’t grant rights to exploit content. The agency expressed particular concern about ChatGPT attributing fabricated interviews to ANI, including a non-existent conversation with Rahul Gandhi, who leads the opposing party to the current party in power.
In its lawsuit, ANI has argued that such “hallucinations” pose a real threat to the news agency’s reputation, and that the spread of fake news can lead to public disorder.
The court plans to appoint an independent expert to advise on the copyright implications of AI models using publicly available content. The judge will examine additional technical aspects of how news content spreads across multiple platforms in future hearings."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/sagence-is-building-analog-chips-to-run-ai/,Sagence is building analog chips to run AI | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-19,"Graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips on which most AI models run, are energy-hungry beasts. As a consequence of the accelerating incorporation of GPUs in data centers, AI will drive a 160% uptick in electricity demand by 2030, Goldman Sachs estimates.
The trend isn’t sustainable, argues Vishal Sarin, an analog and memory circuit designer. After working in the chip industry for over a decade, Sarin launched Sagence AI (it previously went by the name Analog Inference) to design energy-efficient alternatives to GPUs.
“The applications that could make practical AI computing truly pervasive are restricted because the devices and systems processing the data cannot achieve the required performance,” Sarin said. “Our mission is to break the performance and economics limitations, and in an environmentally responsible way.”
Sagence develops chips and systems for running AI models, as well as the software to program these chips. While there’s no shortage of companies creating custom AI hardware, Sagence is somewhat unique in that its chips are analog, not digital.
Most chips, including GPUs, store information digitally, as binary strings of ones and zeros. In contrast, analog chips can represent data using a range of different values.
Analog chips aren’t a new concept. They had their heyday from about 1935 to 1980, helping model the North American electrical grid, among other engineering feats. But the drawbacks of digital chips are making analog attractive once again.
For one, digital chips require hundreds of components to perform certain calculations that analog chips can achieve with just a few modules. Digital chips also usually have to shuttle data back and forth from memory to processors, causing bottlenecks.
“All the leading legacy suppliers of AI silicon use this old architectural approach, and this is blocking the progress of AI adoption,” Sarin said.
Analog chips like Sagence’s, which are “in-memory” chips, don’t transfer data from memory to processors, potentially enabling them to complete tasks faster. And, thanks to their ability to use a range of values to store data, analog chips can have higher data-density than their digital counterparts.
Analog tech has its downsides, however. For example, it can be harder to achieve high precision with analog chips because they require more accurate manufacturing. They also tend to be tougher to program.
But Sarin sees Sagence’s chips complementing — not replacing — digital chips, for example, to accelerate specialized applications in servers and mobile devices.
“Sagence products are designed to eliminate the power, cost and latency issues inherent in GPU hardware, while delivering high performance for AI applications,” he said.
Sagence, which plans to bring its chips to market in 2025, is engaged with “multiple” customers as it looks to compete with other AI analog chip ventures like EnCharge and Mythic, Sarin said. “We’re currently packaging our core technology into system-level products and ensuring that we fit into existing infrastructure and deployment scenarios,” he added.
Sagence has secured investments from backers including Vinod Khosla, TDK Ventures, Cambium Capital, Blue Ivy Ventures, Aramco Ventures and New Science Ventures, raising a total of $58 million in the six years since its founding.
Now, the startup is planning to raise capital again to expand its 75-person team.
“Our cost structure is favorable because we’re not chasing the performance goals by migrating to the newest [manufacturing processes] for our chips,” Sarin said. “That’s a big factor for us.”
The timing might just work in Sagence’s favor. Per Crunchbase, funding to semiconductor startups appears to be bouncing back after a lackluster 2023. From January to July, VC-backed chip startups raised nearly $5.3 billion — a number well ahead of last year, when such firms saw less than $8.8 billion raised in total.
This being the case, chipmaking is an expensive proposition — made all the more challenging by international sanctions and tariffs promised by the incoming Trump administration. Winning customers who’ve become “locked in” to ecosystems like Nvidia’s is another uphill climb. Last year, AI chipmaker Graphcore, which raised nearly $700 million and was once valued at close to $3 billion, filed for insolvency after struggling to gain a strong foothold in the market.
To have any chance at success, Sagence will have to prove that its chips do, indeed, draw dramatically less power and deliver higher efficiency than alternatives — and raise enough venture funding to fabricate at scale."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/yuka-the-app-that-rates-food-and-makeup-lets-users-complain-to-brands-with-its-new-feature/,"Yuka, the app that rates food and makeup, now lets users complain to companies directly | TechCrunch",Lauren Forristal,2024-11-19,"Yuka is a popular health app that allows users to scan the barcodes of food items to quickly see a health ranking based on additives, sugar, saturated fat, and fiber. It also scans cosmetic products, highlighting any harmful substances like endocrine disruptors, carcinogens, allergens, and irritants. Yuka then recommends healthier options, helping consumers make more educated and mindful decisions.
Since its introduction in France in 2017, Yuka has revealed significant issues with major corporations regarding harmful ingredients that many customers are unaware they are consuming. For example, French supermarket chain Intermarché changed 900 recipes and removed 140 additives due to pressure from consumers and Yuka users.
Now, the company is expanding its mission by introducing a new feature that provides users with a direct way to contact brands using these problematic ingredients.
Launched today, the new “Call-out the Brand” button allows users to challenge companies directly. When a user scans a product that turns out to be marked with Yuka’s red label — which indicates health concerns — they will see an option to email the product’s manufacturer, pushing them to rethink the use of harmful additives. Yuka provides a default message but allows users to personalize it if they wish.
Additionally, users have the option to publish a post on X to advocate for change publicly. The company is working on adding support for other social media platforms, such as Instagram and others.
Emails and social media posts often lack impact when only a few people participate, but Yuka believes that this feature could encourage thousands, or even millions, of consumers to take a stand for healthier products. A study by the Food Industry Association (FMI) and NielsenIQ found that 72% of participants prioritize transparent product information and labeling when choosing which food brands to support.
This feature may be particularly beneficial for Americans, where food regulations are less strict than in Europe.
The new tool is only available to premium users in France and the U.S. The membership ranges from $10 to $50 per year and offers features like offline mode, unlimited history, and more. It’ll roll out to additional countries in the coming months.
Yuka is available to download on the App Store and Google Play Store. The app boasts 1 million paid users, 700,000 of which are in the U.S. Overall, it has over 60 million worldwide users."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/socium-raises-5m-seed-led-by-breega/,Socium doubles down on Francophone Africa after $5M seed round | TechCrunch,Annie Njanja,2024-11-19,"Demand for HR-tech solutions in Africa is growing, and Senegal’s Socium is out to tap the opportunity in French-speaking countries on the continent.
Socium has since 2021 built HR solutions that target users within the 21 countries of Francophone Africa and plans to continue narrowing its focus on the region, where it is enjoying first-mover advantage.
Socium co-founder Samba Lo (CEO) revealed these plans to TechCrunch and told us the startup has also raised $5 million seed funding to fuel its growth plans in the region.
“So for us, deploying within Francophone Africa is very interesting…Because we have the same economic community, we have very close regulations, we have the same currency, in addition, the market for HR software is very huge. So for these reasons, we prefer to stay in Francophone Africa, because, I think we have so much to do here,” said Lo, who co-founded the startup with Serigne Seye.
Socium’s solution enables its clients to recruit, pay, and manage talent. However, that was never what the duo set out to offer when they first came together in 2021.
Initially, Lo said, they started out as a recruitment website to enable companies to find talent and for people to find jobs. Then, they discovered that the HR world was huge.
“Our customers started to ask us if we have some solution for payroll, other solution for time management, some solution for performance management. And you know, we decided to build a global HR platform to help HR to manage all their processes,” said Lo.
That is how in 2023 they started building a solution that can “work everywhere from Morocco to Cameroon to Congo”,  mentioning some of the countries the startup plans to expand into.
For instance, the company has built a payroll engine that takes into account complexity of payroll calculations in the region. This, he says, enables the startup to launch in new countries within two weeks, which is a faster than foreign-based solutions.
Socium’s solution automates mundane tasks, which lessens human resource and payroll workload, and uses AI to, for instance, easily score and match CVs to job offers and to aid in writing job descriptions. This enables HR managers to focus on more important roles such as managing and supporting teams to meet their goals.
“Focus on people means focus on performance, their evaluation and competence and career path for each individual. And for this reason, our main focus is to continue to help them to work, to manage their daily tasks more easily and to be able to be focused on the most important part of the HR. And I think the most important part for HR is weighted to people inside the company,” said Lo.
As it scales, the startup is also looking to integrate with tax agencies to automate tax and regulatory filings for companies, alleviating more headachex for companies.
Lo first connected with Seye at École Polytechnique. After graduating, Lo briefly worked as a data scientist before switching to investment banking and joining Skeat, a French startup. This awakened his entrepreneurial spirit.
“I joined them when they had only six months of cash left. And so that was very complicated, but for me, that was the best switch of my life, because it helped me to discover entrepreneurship, it helped me to discover startups, and it also helped me to discover SaaS… During Covid, I had deep reflection about how can I be useful to my community and for me, it was obvious that I have to launch something related to SaaS in Africa,” said Lo.
To date, the Socium says it has over 100 active clients, cutting across 10 industries and 15 countries, and becomes one of the few HR techs in Africa that have raised funding in recent times. WorkPay, a Kenyan startup that is said to be serving more than 1,000 customers across 20 African countries, recently closed a $5 million Series A round led by Norskenn22.
Socium’s seed round was led by Breega, while Partech, Orange Ventures, Chui ventures, Sonatel, Outlierz, Super Capital, Evolem, Techmind and a number of angel investors also participated, and Raisers Partners were financial advisers.

But Ben Affleck says that actors and screenwriters shouldn’t worry about AI because it’s not capable of doing either job today, and likely won’t for a long time.
“Movies will be one of the last things — if everything gets replaced — to be replaced by AI,” said Affleck during an onstage interview with CNBC last week. “AI can write you an excellent imitative verse that sounds Elizabethan; it cannot write you Shakespeare.”
Affleck, who runs a movie studio with Matt Damon now, seems to have a decent grasp on how AI works, offering a barebones definition of transformer architectures at one point in the interview. He’s surprisingly optimistic regarding AI’s impact on the film industry, saying it may actually create more work for actors and screenwriters. That said, Affleck notes that the visual effects business could be in trouble."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/venture-funding-in-europe-in-2024-fell-to-45-billion-says-atomico/,"Venture funding in Europe fell to $45B in 2024, says Atomico | TechCrunch",Ingrid Lunden,2024-11-19,"Funding for European tech appears to have stabilized in 2024 after dropping precipitously in 2023, but the signs continue to point to more tough times ahead, according to the latest State of European Tech report.
The annual survey, produced by European VC firm Atomico, notes that startups in the region are on track to raise $45 billion this year. While far from the 50% drop of 2023, the figure is still down by $2 billion compared to a year ago. Atomico originally projected $45 billion for 2023; it has since revised 2023 up to $47 billion.
The decline this year is slight but is notable because the narrative post-pandemic had been that the drop we saw in 2023 was simply a return to “normal” growth curves.
That narrative goes something like this: funding and other tech market indicators have been steadily rising for almost as long as they have been tracked. The years 2021 and 2022 were outliers, resulting from a burst of activity from more people using cloud, mobile and other digital services at home and at work during the pandemic, and thousands of companies and investors rushing to meet the opportunity. But by the end of 2022, it was clear that the “new normal” was not here to stay. So, things settled back to “old normal” and we are back on track.
Well, 2024 figures now show us we may need to rethink all that, again.
Atomico has been producing these reports annually for the last decade, so this latest edition makes a lot of noise about how much things have improved.
It’s undeniable that the tech ecosystem in Europe has blown up: Atomico says there are now 35,000 tech companies in the region that could be classified as “early stage,” with 3,400 late-stage companies and 358 valued at over $1 billion. Compare that to 2015, when there were a mere 7,800 early-stage startups, 450 late-stage startups and just 72 tech companies valued at over $1 billion.
Yet there is a lot of sobering reading, too, about some of the challenges of the moment and signs of how geopolitical and economic unrest — despite shiny stories about the boom in AI — continue to weigh down the market.
Here are some of the breakout stats:
Exits have fallen off a cliff
This is one of the more stark tables in the report, underscoring some of the liquidity pressure that ultimately trickles down to earlier-stage tech companies.
Put simply, M&As and IPOs are relatively non-existent right now in European tech. This year, at the time of the report being published in mid-November, saw just $3 billion in IPO value and $10 billion in M&A, according to S&P Capital figures. Both of these are big drops on the overall trend, which had otherwise seen steady rises in both, “consistently surpassing the $50 billion per year threshold.”
Granted, sometimes all it takes is one big deal to make a year. In 2023, for example, ARM’s $65 billion IPO accounted for a full 92% of total IPO value, and clearly it didn’t have the knock-on effect many had hoped for in kick-starting more activity.
Transaction volumes, Atomico notes, are at their lowest points in a decade.
Debt is on the rise
As you might expect, debt financing is filling in the funding gap, especially for startups raising growth rounds. So far this year, debt financing made up a full 14% of all VC investments, totaling some $4.7 billion.
That’s a big jump on last year, according to Dealroom’s figures: In 2023, debt made up just $2.6 billion of financing, accounting for 5.5% of all VC investments. Debt at its best is raised when companies are in strong financial positions and do not want to give up more equity to raise money to grow. The other side of the coin is when debt, often more easily raised than equity, is picked up because equity rounds are harder to come by.
So the big question on debt remains as ever: will all the companies racking it up  definitely make good on paying it down?
Average round sizes have improved
Last year, the average size of every stage of funding, from Series A to D, declined in Europe, with only seed-stage rounds continuing to increase.
However, amid the overall decline in the number of funding rounds in the region, the startups that are managing to close deals are, on average, raising more. The average Series A round is now $10.6 million (2023: $9.3 million), Series B is at $25.4 million (2023: $21.3 million), and Series C is at $55 million (2023: $43 million).
The U.S. continues to outpace Europe on round sizes overall.
But don’t expect rounds to be raised in quick successions
Atomico noted that the number of startups, on average, raising within a 24-month time frame declined by 20%. It has also taken longer for companies to go from Series A to Series B in what the firm calls “compressed” time frames of 15 months or less — just 16% raised a Series B in that period in 2024.
As you can see in the table below, the number of rounds this year is lower than what we saw the year before.
AI continues to lead the pack
As with 2023, artificial intelligence continued to dominate conversations. Atomico spells this out with a graph showing the burst of AI mentions in earnings calls.
That has been a strong theme among private companies. Between companies like Wayve, Helsing, Mistral, Poolside, DeepL, and many others, AI startups have led the pack when it comes to the biggest venture deals this year in Europe, raising $11 billion in all.
Even so, Atomico points out, “Europe has a long way to close the gap with the U.S. in terms of AI funding.” Thanks to outsized rounds for companies like OpenAI, all told, the U.S. is shaping up to have invested $47 billion in AI companies this year — that’s right, $2 billion more than all startup investment in Europe.
The U.K. (thanks in big part to Wayve’s outsized raise of the year in Europe, but also because it simply has more companies raising more rounds across more stages) is currently the biggest market for AI funding in the region, Atomico said.
Valuations are improving…
After startup valuations “bottomed out” in 2023, Atomico sees them rising again, lagging behind the slow return of activity in the public markets. Some of that is likely also due to the outsized rounds raised by certain companies in certain fields like AI.
More generally, it appears that founders are more open to dilution on larger rounds in earlier stages, which plays out as higher valuations. Startups raising at later stages are picking up the pieces of that earlier exuberance and are raising down-rounds, Atomico said.
European startups continue to see lower valuations than their American counterparts, on average between 29% and 52% lower, Atomico notes.
In the graph below, charting Series C, the average valuation of U.S. startups is $218 million, compared to $155 million for startups in Europe.
…but sentiment is not
If confidence is a strong indicator of a market’s health, there might be some work ahead for the motivators out there.
Atomico has been polling founders and investors annually, asking how they feel about the state of the market compared to a year ago, and 2024 appears to be a high-water mark for low confidence.
In a frank assessment of how founders and investors are viewing the market at the moment, a record proportion — respectively 40% and 26% — said they felt less confident than 12 months ago."

This week, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said she wouldn’t be surprised if the company launched Starship 400 times over the next four years. What do you think? How realistic are those numbers, on the scale of “almost certain” to “no chance in hell”? I believe SpaceX has the manufacturing know-how to make it happen. But I can’t help but wonder if regulators and the rest of the industry are ready — regulators, to actually process and keep up with that scale, and the industry, to actually fill all those Starships with useful mass.
But hey, with the Department of Government Efficiency online, anything is possible.

Speaking of Starship, I wrote a little explainer about the vehicle’s history and development, with the target reader being that family member of yours who really doesn’t get WTF is the big deal about it. For the die-hard space fans, there probably isn’t too much in there that you didn’t already know…but keep the link bookmarked to easily send to all the Starship-skeptics in your life.
As the saying goes: “Space is hard.” That difficulty was on full display with ABL Space Systems’ announcement that it was pivoting from commercial launch to missile defense. There’s certainly a massive appetite within the DOD for this tech — the department’s fiscal year 2025 budget allocates $13.5 billion for missile defense programs — but we’ll have to wait and see to learn how exactly ABL plans to use its existing IP for this new purpose.
This week we’re celebrating the Apollo 12 crew, which touched down on the lunar surface on November 19, 1969. Astronauts Charles Conrad Jr. and Alan Bean spent around 31 hours on the moon while the third person in the crew, Richard Gordon, remained in lunar orbit. One of the most significant achievements of the mission was the pinpoint landing: The spacecraft Intrepid touched down just 535 feet from the Surveyor 3 probe."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/servicetitan-names-llms-from-microsoft-openai-as-risk-factors/,"ServiceTitan names LLMs from Microsoft, OpenAI as risk factors | TechCrunch",Julie Bort,2024-11-18,"Every IPO S-1 prospectus includes a section listing all kinds risk factors for why its stock may not be a good buy. Many of them are boilerplate warnings, cautions over financial performance, or acts of war and nature. But some of them are more specific to the company.
With ServiceTitan, a cloud service startup that filed public IPO documents with the SEC on Monday, we may be witnessing the birth of a new boilerplate warning: large language models (LLMs) that help grow business could also lead to damage.
ServiceTitan had an 1,150-word risk factor on how its use of AI, specifically generative AI, could adversely impact its business. It warned that LLM hallucinatory behavior could produce “inaccurate” information and engage in “discriminatory” behaviors; its LLMs could infringe on others’ copyright or intellectual property; and using LLMs means exposing more data to potential hacks and harm. Then again, if it can’t get enough data, it may not be able to continue offering AI products or building new ones. On top of that, the company cautions that its employees or contractors could possibly mistakenly share its customers’ private data with third-party systems that could then lead to security breaches, or use that data to train their models.
ServiceTitan warns that its use of AI may one day run afoul of social and ethical issues. Or that future regulations could cost it money.
ServiceTitan also fears that it may not be able to hire the AI experts it needs for its products and, even if it can, that talent will be pricey. ServiceTitan warns its AI products rely on third-party services it doesn’t control — and specifically names Microsoft and OpenAI. So, if they become unavailable or have issues, that’s a risk too.
These warnings are interesting because ServiceTitan operates at the nexus of the industries that GenAI, specifically LLM-driven AI agents, is expected to dominate. ServiceTitan offers software for field service industry businesses — largely small businesses, think construction contractors, HVAC professionals, landscapers, and the like. Its software performs functions like marketing, customer relationship management, customer support, and accounting. (ServiceTitan declined further comment.)
AI agents are currently marching so furiously toward all things sales, marketing, and CRM that the king of the CRM market, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, told TechCrunch that his company alone could have a billion AI agents working at Salesforce’s customers’ companies in a year.
ServiceTitan has been offering AI-powered services since at least 2023, called Titan Intelligence. In October, it also rolled out a suite of AI agents for sales, customer service, and call centers.
But LLMs were designed to study words, images, and data and create their own versions of things. That is, they were designed to make stuff up. OpenAI’s scientists are busy racing toward general intelligence — mimicking humans’ ability to infer even better — meaning they are working on AI that they hope will be even more creative.
Sure, LLM reliability for business usage is something that should be solved over time as more companies specialize in agents where reliability, not creativity, is essential. But it’s worth noting that those that are selling AI bots today are actually saying the quiet part out loud in their legalese: At this early stage, AI adoption could create as many problems as it solves."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/in-2023-vcs-returned-the-lowest-level-of-capital-to-their-investors-since-2011/,In 2023 VCs returned the lowest level of capital to their investors since 2011 | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-11-18,"It’s no secret that the venture capital industry is facing a liquidity crisis as IPOs and other exits remain few and far between after 2020 and 2021’s record-breaking years. Now, we have numbers that show just how bad it’s gotten.
In 2023, the U.S. VC industry invested $60 billion more into startups than it collected back in returns, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing PitchBook data. That is the largest deficit recorded in PitchBook’s 26 years of data. The data also found that U.S. VCs only returned $26 billion worth of shares back to their investors in 2023, the lowest total since 2011.
Despite the void in exits, the past three years have recorded the highest yearly totals of venture funding in the history of the industry.
There are signs that the exit market may begin to open up next year — companies like Klarna and ServiceTitan both have IPOs in the works —  which could help start to cut that deficit."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/trumps-fcc-pick-has-said-he-wants-to-ban-tiktok-challenge-section-230/,"Trump's FCC pick has said he wants to ban TikTok, challenge Section 230 | TechCrunch",Amanda Silberling,2024-11-18,"Though President-elect Donald Trump has been expected to stop the looming ban on TikTok, his political appointments suggest otherwise.
Trump announced on Sunday that he selected Brendan Carr to chair the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates the internet, news media, and other forms of communication. Carr, whom Trump appointed to the FCC in 2017, authored the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 chapter on the commission, where he outlines an agenda that is sometimes at odds with the president-elect’s promises.
“TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America’s national security,” Carr wrote in Project 2025. “It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.”
While there has not been public evidence of the Chinese government accessing American TikTok users’ data, there has been proof that ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, has accessed TikTok user data.
Trump’s current positioning to reverse the TikTok ban is surprising, given that he signed an executive order to essentially ban the app in 2020, at the end of his first term. But after Joe Biden took office, Trump’s executive order became moot. Still, the government under Biden ended up arriving at a similar conclusion; the president signed a bill that would force ByteDance to sell the app, although the Chinese conglomerate is unlikely to comply.
“Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC in March. He shared this sentiment on Truth Social as well, where he claimed that Mark Zuckerberg’s company is “a true enemy of the people.”
In his statement on Carr’s appointment, Trump does not address their apparent differences.
“Commissioner Carr is a warrior for free speech and has fought against regulatory lawfare that has stifled Americans’ freedoms, and held back our economy,” Trump wrote.
Carr’s concern about Chinese influence extends to the sale of Chinese communications equipment, like cell phones. As it stands, Chinese hardware company Huawei cannot sell gear in the U.S. without FCC approval, and Carr thinks that the FCC should be more vigilant about assessing products from Chinese manufacturers. He even wants to invest an extra $3 billion into the “rip and replace” program that reimburses communications providers for replacing gear from Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese company making telecom equipment.
While Carr has taken a largely deregulatory approach to the FCC, he is adamant about imposing increased restrictions on tech companies.
“We must dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans,” Carr wrote on X. Fellow Trump appointee Elon Musk replied, “Based.”
This position extends to Section 230, a part of the Communications Decency Act that, among other things, protects providers of online services — like social media networks — from being held liable for the user-generated content they host. So, if someone posts something unlawful on a social media app, the user is responsible for potential repercussions, not the app. Section 230 also allows online organizations to remove and moderate material posted by third parties.
Organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argue that overturning this bipartisan legislation, which has existed for over 25 years, could be a threat to free speech on the internet.
“Without Section 230’s protections, many online intermediaries would intensively filter and censor user speech, while others may simply not host user content at all,” the EFF wrote. “This reinforces the First Amendment’s protections for publishers to decide what content they will distribute.”
But Carr is pushing for Section 230 reform on the grounds that it allows social media platforms to “drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.” He believes that the FCC should work with Congress to make sure that “internet companies no longer have carte blanche to censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections.”
Section 230 has faced legal challenges at the Supreme Court level but has not yet been subject to major reforms. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Twitter and Google in two adjacent cases that sought to hold the platforms accountable for hosting content from the Islamic State that promoted the terrorist organization in connection to violent attacks.
The same Supreme Court that presided over those cases will remain in control for the foreseeable future, and it’s possible that they could hear more challenges to the internet law in the coming years."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/doordash-users-can-import-grocery-lists-into-the-app-to-shop-for-items-faster/,DoorDash's app can now import your grocery list for faster shopping | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-11-18,"While online grocery shopping is generally convenient, manually adding items to your cart one by one can become a bit of a chore. To address this, food and grocery shopping app DoorDash has launched a new feature that allows you to sync your grocery list to the app. The app will then suggest what to add to your cart based on the items on your list. iOS users can import lists from Apple’s Reminders app, too.
To use the new feature, first select the store where you want to shop. Then, look for the buttons “Create a list” or “Import a list.” With the create option, you can either copy and paste lists from anywhere on your phone (including online recipes) or type items manually in the text box to search everything all at once. Meanwhile, the import option is only available for the Reminders app on iOS. However, a spokesperson told us that DoorDash plans to add support for Android in the future.
A variety of grocery options will be available for each item, such as different types of onions (white, yellow, and red) that you can quickly add to your cart by tapping the plus (+) symbol.
In addition to being a convenience to consumers and a way to increase engagement with DoorDash’s app, the feature helps the company differentiate itself from other major U.S. competitors like Grubhub, Instacart, and Uber Eats.
This isn’t the first time a food delivery app has attempted a similar tool. Last month, Swiggy, an Indian online food ordering company, was spotted testing the ability to upload images of grocery lists to its app.
DoorDash announced this feature on Monday, along with other updates in anticipation of the holiday season. These include a partnership with the food magazine Bon Appétit, which offers free recipes and the option to have ingredients delivered from a nearby store.
Additionally, DoorDash has revamped its search results to allow users to search for an item across different merchants, displaying prices and estimated delivery times all in one place. This capability is currently only available for alcohol, but it will expand to more retail categories in the coming months, such as beauty and electronics.
This story was updated with additional information from a DoorDash spokesperson."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/marlon-nichols-talks-relationship-building-in-the-african-markets/,Marlon Nichols talks relationship building in the African markets | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-11-18,"Marlon Nichols took the stage at AfroTech last week to discuss the importance of building relationships when it comes to entering into a new market. “One of the first things you do when you go to a new market is you’ve got to meet the new players,” he said. “Like, what do people need? What’s hot right now?”
Nichols is the co-founder and managing general partner at MaC Venture Capital, which just raised a $150 million Fund III, and has invested more than $20 million into at least 10 African companies. His first investment in the continent was back in 2015 before investing in African startups became trendy. He said that investment helped him grow his presence in Africa.
African startups raised between $2.9 billion and $4.1 billion last year. That was down from the $4.6 billion to $6.5 billion raised in 2022, which defied the global venture slowdown.
He noticed that the biggest sectors ripe for innovation in Africa were health tech and fintech, which have become two of the continent’s biggest industries due to the lack of payment infrastructure and health systems that lack funding.
Today, much of MaC Venture Capital’s investing happens in Nigeria and Kenya, helped in part by the robust network Nichols’ firm has been able to craft. Nichols said that people start making connections with other people and foundations that can help build a network of trusted advisers. “When the deal comes my way, I look at it and I can pass it to all these people that know from a firsthand perspective,” he said. But he also said that these networks allow one to angel invest in budding companies, which is another way to enter the market.
Though funding is down, there is a glimmer of hope: The funding dip was expected as investors retreated, but, at the same time, it was accompanied by investors looking beyond the four major African markets — Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, and Nigeria — and spreading capital in Francophone Africa, which started to see a surge in deal flows that put it on par with the “Big Four.”
More early-stage investors have started to pop up in Africa, too, but Nichols said there is a bigger need for later-staged firms that invest from Series A to C, for example, to enter the market. “I believe that the next great trading relationship will be with countries on the continent of Africa,” he said. “So you got to plant the seeds now.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/venture-capitalists-continue-to-play-musical-chairs/,"From Lauri Moore to Vic Singh, venture capitalists continue to play musical chairs",Rebecca Szkutak,2024-11-18,"From Keith Rabois to Ethan Kurzweil, a lot of VCs have switched firms or spun out of storied VC institutions to launch their own funds this year. These employment changes are surprising because unlike in many other fields, venture capitalists don’t traditionally move around very much — especially those who reach the partner or general partner level.
VC funds have 10-year life cycles, and partners have good reason to stay that course. In some instances, there may be a “key man” on a firm’s fund, meaning that if they leave, the fund’s LPs have the right to pull their capital out if they choose. Many partners and GPs also have some of their own money invested in their firms’ funds, which gives them further reason to stick around.
So, while big-name investor moves in venture capital aren’t common, they seem to have become so in 2024. So far this year, there have been notable instances of investors returning to old firms, striking out on their own, or taking a pause from investing entirely. There have also been some key hires to note.
Here’s who we know of so far:

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/openai-investor-josh-kushner-praises-musk-despite-musks-openai-lawsuit/,"OpenAI investor Josh Kushner praises Musk, despite Musk’s OpenAI lawsuit | TechCrunch",Marina Temkin,2024-11-18,"Elon Musk may be suing OpenAI, accusing the ChatGPT maker of abandoning the company’s original mission as a nonprofit organization, but Josh Kushner, founder of Thrive Capital and one of the company’s key investors, has nothing but good things to say about the world’s richest man.
“I have deep admiration and respect for Elon,” Kushner said last week at Fortune Global Forum.
His position may not be a surprise. Thrive is an investor in SpaceX, and Kushner has family ties to Donald Trump, whom Musk helped elect. Kushner is the younger brother of the president-elect’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
Indeed, when asked if he may be more worried about his investment in OpenAI now that Musk has an outsized influence with the incoming White House, Kushner didn’t miss a chance to praise Musk’s political intentions. (Earlier last week, Trump appointed Musk to co-lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.)
“My interpretation of [Musk’s] excitement to participate in the government is very much driven by his desire to do right by everyone,” Kushner said. “I have extreme confidence that he is always going to do what he thinks is right for all Americans.”
Musk is taking more action than just suing OpenAI, which he helped establish and donated $44 million to. Last year, he launched an OpenAI competitor, xAI.
His lawsuit has named OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman as defendants, but Kushner didn’t want to highlight the dispute between the co-founders of his portfolio company and Musk.
“I know for certain that both Sam and Greg have deep respect and an immense amount of gratitude for all that Elon has done not just for OpenAI but for the rest of the world and humanity,” Kushner said.
Two days after Fortune interviewed Kushner, Musk filed an amended complaint, which also named Microsoft, its current board member Reid Hoffman, and former OpenAI board member and Microsoft VP Dee Templeton as new defendants.
It should be pointed out that many venture capital firms often try not to back direct competitors as part of their conflict-of-interest policies. However, it’s also true that many investors have been willing to back the hottest competitive AI companies if they were given the chance. Sequoia, for instance, was an early backer of OpenAI and has been a key investor in xAI.
Thrive was the lead backer of OpenAI’s latest $6.5 billion round, which valued the company at $157 billion. Kushner’s fund contributed $1.3 billion of that capital, with $750 million coming from the firm’s fund and $550 million from other investors through a special purpose vehicle, the New York Times reported. Thrive also reportedly has an option to invest an additional $1 billion in OpenAI next year at the same $157 billion valuation if the company hits its revenue goal of $11.6 billion. Thrive is not listed as an investor in xAI or any direct OpenAI competitor, according to its profile on PitchBook.
While Kushner’s public praise of Musk indicates how little he wants to rock the boat between the leaders of two of his high-profile portfolio companies, Musk’s allegations didn’t, perhaps, come out of the blue. Sources told Reuters in October that OpenAI asked its investors to avoid backing a specific list of other AI companies, including Musk’s xAI.
In the updated lawsuit, Musk’s lawyers argue that OpenAI is now “actively trying to eliminate competitors” like xAI by “extracting promises from investors not to fund them.”
In August, Thrive raised $5 billion across two funds: a $1 billion early-stage fund and $4 billion for investing in later-stage companies. The firm, which was founded in 2009, has a total of $15.5 billion in assets under management, according to PitchBook data."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/trumps-pro-fracking-energy-secretary-pick-has-also-invested-in-geothermal-and-nuclear-startups/,Trump’s pro-fracking energy secretary pick has also invested in geothermal and nuclear startups | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-18,"President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday that he would be nominating Chris Wright, CEO of oilfield services company Liberty Energy, to the post of energy secretary.
Wright has been a big booster of oil and gas. From his perch at Liberty, Wright last year denied that there’s a climate crisis or that it’ll result in negative impacts, something that puts him at odds with the majority of atmospheric and climate scientists, or that the world is undergoing an energy transition. He claimed that energy prices are up as a result of policies favorable to clean energy, despite the fact that oil prices have been flat since 2010 and natural gas prices are down 50%, too.
At the same time, Wright acknowledged that the climate is changing and the seas are rising. He’s also no stranger to climate tech.
Liberty invested in Fervo Energy, an advanced geothermal startup, in 2022, participating in a $138 million round. Fervo builds on fracking technology originally developed to drill oil and gas wells to drive down the costs of geothermal power.
Wright also sits on the board of Oklo, a nuclear power startup chaired by Sam Altman. Oklo went public via SPAC in 2023, and while it’s had trouble getting its reactor designs certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, its share price has doubled in the last month as investors have ridden the energy-for-data centers wave.
If confirmed by the Senate, Wright would oversee the Department of Energy’s sweeping portfolio, from nuclear weapons testing to national labs, emergency petroleum reserves to energy-efficiency programs.
He would also oversee the Loan Programs Office (LPO), which offers loan guarantees for large energy-related infrastructure projects. While most earlier stage startups wouldn’t be directly affected by any change in the LPO, debt offered through the program is something like a light at the end of the tunnel, providing helpful support as they go to raise from private lenders to deploy their technologies at commercial scale.
The LPO currently holds about $35 billion in its portfolio, most of which falls under the climate tech umbrella, including utility-scale solar projects, wind farms, and carbon capture installations."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/former-tusimple-co-founder-urges-courts-to-block-asset-transfer-to-china/,Former TuSimple co-founder urges courts to block asset transfer to China | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-11-18,"Xiaodi Hou, the co-founder and former CEO of self-driving trucking startup TuSimple, has urged a California district court to issue a temporary restraining order to stop the company from transferring its remaining U.S. assets to China, according to a recent court filing.
Hou, who plans to apply for a temporary restraining order in December during the next scheduled court hearing, is hoping to keep TuSimple from moving tens of millions of dollars in cash to China. As of September, TuSimple had roughly $450 million in capital. Hou is also requesting expedited discovery of evidence to aid his requests for the motion.
Hou’s declaration to the court, filed on Monday, is the latest escalation in the battle between TuSimple and some of its shareholders, over the company’s attempts to use investor capital to fund a new AI-generated animation and video game business in China.This is the first time Hou — who was ousted from his role as CEO in 2022 — has publicly accused TuSimple and its leaders of funneling assets toward animation and gaming businesses owned by or with direct ties to Mo Chen, TuSimple co-founder and chairman of the board, under the guise of a business pivot. Hou also argued the company violated SEC regulations by neither informing nor gaining approval from shareholders before changing its business direction or transferring funds to China.
Hou now heads Bot Auto, a new autonomous trucking startup in Texas
TuSimple, once valued at $8.5 billion after its 2021 IPO, faced setbacks that led to its U.S. shutdown and delisting in January 2024. The company’s stated goal was to commercialize its AV technology in China. But as the year progressed, TuSimple slashed its workforce, ceased self-driving operations, and began hiring staff to handle jobs related to AI gaming and animation.
Shareholders sent a letter to the board in August after learning TuSimple was putting resources toward AI gaming and animation. The board responded a couple weeks later by publicly announcing the new business unit.
Hou this week urged the court to issue a temporary restraining order after noticing a filing by TuSimple China that signaled the company was about to transfer money (or already had) out of the United States. Two TuSimple China subsidiaries last week registered an increase in assets collectively worth $150 million, according to Hou’s declaration and information from public filings.
“These filings show a suspicious increase in registered assets between these two subsidiaries in one day as a precursor to large amount of cash transfer from U.S. to China,” reads the declaration. “The most likely scenario is that these filings in China were the preparatory steps before TuSimple U.S. transfers money to those subsidiaries in China.”
Hou added that such large cash transfers are “beyond normal course of business” and comparable to “TuSimple China’s heyday of operation when it was operating a large autonomous truck fleet in Shanghai” and had around 700 employees on its payroll. As of September, TuSimple China had around 200 employees.
The window of opportunity for shareholders like Hou to get what they want — which is for TuSimple to liquidate so they can recuperate some of their losses — is narrowing.
TuSimple is in a gray area when it comes to enforcement from the Securities and Exchange Commission. While TuSimple delisted earlier this year, the company is still registered with the SEC and thus subject to U.S. scrutiny. Once the money goes to China, shareholders in the U.S. will have no recourse to claw back funds from their original investment.
TechCrunch has reached out to the SEC to learn if the agency is investigating TuSimple in relation to shareholder complaints.
Cheng Lu, CEO of TuSimple, didn’t respond to TechCrunch’s request for clarification regarding the potential transfer of roughly $150 million from the U.S. to China. The executive told TechCrunch that Hou’s restraining order request is a “desperate retaliation” against TuSimple’s current litigation against Bot Auto. In October, TuSimple filed suit against Bot Auto, alleging trade secrets misappropriation.
“The reality is [Xiaodi Hou] is a disgraced CEO that has been trying to disrupt the company from moving forward for the past two years ago, and trying hard to bankrupt the company so that he can get away with stealing our trade secrets to start a competing business,” Lu told TechCrunch.
TuSimple had requested its own temporary injunction and restraining order against Bot Auto. A Texas court appears ready to deny those applications because TuSimple has been unable to back up its claims, according to a proposed order.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/mastodon-sees-a-boost-from-the-x-exodus-too-founder-says/,"Mastodon sees a boost from the 'X exodus,' too, founder says | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-11-18,"Decentralized social network Mastodon is also seeing some uplift from the X “exodus,” founder Eugen Rochko shared on the platform just ahead of the weekend. While the Twitter-like startup Bluesky has been capturing headlines and attention for its rapid adoption among former X users, a smaller group has apparently turned to the open source networking platform Mastodon, which has seen downloads increase by 47% on iOS and its monthly active users grow to 894,000 across all Mastodon servers, Rochko says.
In a post on Mastodon, the founder and CEO noted that official app downloads were growing. In addition to the 47% on iOS, they had increased by a smaller 17% on Android. Month over month, sign-ups were also up by 27% with 90,000 newly registered accounts in November.
“We may not be the biggest by numbers yet, but Mastodon (and the fediverse) has proven itself to be an effective and reliable communications platform over the course of the last 8 years, and does not depend on venture capital to survive,” wrote Rochko, subtly jabbing at one of Bluesky’s potential weaknesses with that last bit.
While Mastodon is largely crowdfunded and grant-supported, Bluesky has gone the more traditional startup route by raising money from outside investors. The company last month closed on a $15 million Series A, led by Blockchain Capital. Bluesky plans to generate revenue via subscriptions at some later point and by providing other paid services, like access to custom domains. For some former X users now choosing Mastodon, Bluesky’s obligation to chase venture-sized returns is a non-starter.
Despite Mastodon’s recent “X exodus”-fueled adoption, the latest activity still falls below late 2022 levels, when Mastodon had gotten an early boost thanks to other Twitter drama, including the product changes Elon Musk introduced around moderation and paid verification. As of November 2022, Mastodon had surpassed 1 million monthly active users and was seeing “thousands” of registrations per hour, it said at the time.
Things have slowed since for the X alternative, which today has north of 7.6 million total users compared with Bluesky’s now more than 19.4 million, which is up from 16 million just days ago.
Despite the threat from Bluesky, Rochko says that the fediverse — or the open social web powered by the ActivityPub protocol that underpins Mastodon and newer efforts like Meta’s Threads — is the “long game.” (Threads’ 275 million+ users are not counted among the 10.9+ million broader fediverse users because the platform isn’t fully federated yet.)
“I spent 25% of my life working on Mastodon. It’s kind of wild when you think about it,” Rochko mused on Mastodon. “When I started, Google+ was still around. We’re doing what one of the most resourceful companies in the world couldn’t do. It’s not easy. It’s always easier to just build A Website, then slap some ads on it,” he said, likely referencing Threads’ plan to be ad-supported. “But the fediverse is the long game.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/partiful-is-googles-best-app-of-2024/,Partiful is Google's 'best app' of 2024 | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-11-18,"Partiful, the New York-based event-planning app that’s taking on older solutions like Evite, Eventbrite, and Facebook Events, has been named Google’s app of the year, the tech giant announced on Monday as part of its “best apps and games of 2024” list. The list also highlighted the top game, AFK Journey, alongside other category winners like best multidevice apps, hidden gems, and those devoted to specific platforms, like watches or TVs, among other things.
Partiful was founded in 2020 by Palantir alums Joy Tao and Shreya Murthy, and it raised a $20 million Series A1 round in late 2022. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz and brought Partiful’s total funding to $27.34 million, valuing the company pre-money at $120 million, according to data from PitchBook. Abstract Ventures, Initialized Capital Management, ACME Capital, GV, New Enterprise Associates, and Benchmark also participated in the round.
Dubbed a Gen Z favorite thanks to its younger user base, Partiful lets anyone design event pages and invite their friends from a link, often sent through text messages. Though users don’t need the app to respond to party invites, Partiful event organizers can use the app to manage RSVPs, send updates, upload pics, add questionnaires, and take advantage of other party-planning duties, like raising funds, if needed, or limiting the number of spots. The app also lets users track their party and event invites in one place and sync that information over to their preferred calendar.
The company said its monthly active users had ranged in the “millions” by the end of 2023.
The app is an interesting choice to become Google Play’s “App of the Year” given that much of its user base is on iOS.
According to data from analytics firm Appfigures, Partiful has added 1,077,358 downloads so far this year, but 95% of those were from the Apple App Store. Globally, the app has reached roughly 1.28 million downloads to date, but only 57,835 of those were on Android, the firm said.
Built with React Native, Partiful is most popular in the U.S.; the country accounts for 92% of its App Store downloads and 97% of the total on Google Play. Its weekly downloads grew by 4x this year, and Appfigures said it saw a recent spike on November 1, which drove 71,000 downloads for the week.
Other app and games winners on Monday include fantasy RPG AFK Journey as its Best Game of 2024, Max as the best “multidevice” app, and Clash of Clans as the best multidevice game.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/elevenlabs-now-offers-ability-to-build-conversational-ai-agents/,ElevenLabs now offers ability to build conversational AI agents | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-18,"ElevenLabs, a startup that provides AI voice cloning and a text-to-speech API, launched the ability to build conversational AI bots on Monday.
The company announced that users can now build complete conversational agents on ElevenLabs’ developer platform, with customizable variables such as tone of voice and response length.
ElevenLabs has mostly worked on providing different voices and AI tools for text-to-speech services. The company’s head of growth, Sam Sklar, told TechCrunch that many of its clients were already using this ability to create conversational AI agents. However, the toughest parts were integrating the knowledge base and handling interruptions from customers. That’s why the company decided to build a full pipeline for conversational bots.
Users can log into their ElevenLabs account and start building a conversation agent by selecting a template or creating a new project. They can choose the agent’s primary language, first message, and system prompt to determine the agent’s persona. Developers also have to select a large language model (Gemini, GPT, or Claude), the temperature of responses (to determine how creative the response should be), and token usage limit.
They can also tune other aspects like voice, latency, stability, authentication criteria, and maximum length of conversation with the AI agent.
Users can add their own knowledge base, like a file, URL, or text block, to power the conversational bot. Plus, they can = integrate their own custom LLM with the bot. ElevenLabs’ SDK is compatible with Python, JavaScript, React, and Swift. The company also offers a WebSocket API for more customization.
Companies can also define criteria to collect certain data items — for instance, name and email of customers speaking to the agent — along with evaluation criteria in natural language to define the success or failure of the call.
ElevenLabs is leverage its existing pipeline for the text-to-speech part. The company has to develop speech-to-text capabilities for the new conversational AI product. The company is not offering its speech-to-text API as a stand-alone product as of now, but it might do that in the future, making it a competitor to Google’s, Microsoft’s, and Amazon’s speech-to-text APIs, as well as specialized APIs, such as OpenAI’s Whisper, AssemblyAI, Deepgram, Speechmatics and Gladia.
The company, which is aiming to raise new funding at a valuation north of $3 billion, also competes with other voice AI startups, such as Vapi and Retell — they are also building conversational agents. More notably, the company will rival OpenAI’s real-time conversational API. However, ElevenLabs believes that its customizations and ability to switch models will give it an edge over OpenAI."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/mistral-unveils-new-ai-models-and-chat-features/,Mistral unveils new AI models and chat features | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-18,"French AI startup Mistral has released a slew of updates to its product portfolio as it looks to stay competitive in the cutthroat AI space.
Mistral’s Le Chat chatbot platform can now search the web — with citations in line, a la OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It’s also gained a “canvas” tool along the lines of ChatGPT Canvas, allowing users to modify, transform, or edit content, like webpage mockups and data visualizations, leveraging Mistral’s AI models.
“You can use [the canvas feature] to create documents, presentations, code, mockups… the list goes on,” Mistral writes in a blog post. “You’re able to modify its contents in place without regenerating responses, version your drafts, and preview your designs.”
In addition to all this, Le Chat can now process large PDF documents and images for analysis and summarization, including files containing graphs and equations. As of today, the platform incorporates Black Forest Labs‘ Flux Pro model for image generation. And Le Chat can now host shareable automated workflows for tasks like scanning expense reports and invoice processing; Mistal calls these AI “agents.”
Some of Le Chat’s new capabilities, all of which will remain free while in beta, are made possible by Mistral’s new models.
One, Pixtral Large, can process both text and images — it’s the second in Mistral’s Pixtral family of models. Weighing in at 124 billion parameters, Pixtral Large matches or bests leading models including Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, and OpenAI’s GPT-4o on certain multimodal benchmarks. (Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.)
“Particularly, Pixtral Large is able to understand documents, charts, and natural images,” Mistral wrote in a second blog post. “The model demonstrates frontier-level image understanding.”
Mistral also today unveiled a new version of Mistral Large, its flagship line of text-only models. Called Mistral Large 24.11, the new model brings “notable improvements” in long context understanding, Mistral says, making it well-suited for use cases like document analysis and task automation.
Both Pixtral Large and Mistral Large 24.11 can be used outside of Le Chat under two licenses: a more restrictive license for research and an enterprise license for development and commercialization. Mistral Large 24.11 is already in Mistral’s API and on AI platform Hugging Face, and will soon be available through cloud platforms including Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, Mistral says.
Paris-based Mistral, which recently raised $640 million in venture capital, continues to gradually expand its AI offerings. Over the past few months, the company has launched a free service for developers to test its models, an SDK to let customers fine-tune those models, and new models, including a generative model for code called Codestral.
Co-founded by alumni from Meta and DeepMind, Mistral’s stated mission is to create highly competitive models and services around those models — and ideally make money in the process. While the “making money” bit is proving to be challenging (as it is for most generative AI startups), Mistral reportedly began to generate revenue this summer.
“At Mistral, our approach to AI is different — we’re not chasing artificial general intelligence at all costs; our mission is to instead place frontier AI in your hands, so you get to decide what to do with advanced AI capabilities,” the company wrote in one of its blogs today. “This approach has allowed us to be quite frugal with our capital, while consistently delivering frontier capabilities at affordable price points.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/twenty-is-building-an-open-source-alternative-to-salesforce/,Twenty is building an open source alternative to Salesforce | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-11-18,"If a software product is successful enough, you’ll probably be able to find a company building an open source alternative. And yet, nobody has created a modern open source CRM product that can be considered as a serious competitor to Salesforce.
That’s exactly what Twenty is trying to achieve. For the past couple of years, the startup has been iterating on a brand-new CRM platform and making everything available on GitHub under a permissive AGPLv3 license.
While Twenty doesn’t have all the features that you can find in Salesforce, the company is slowly building a community of CRM and open source enthusiasts around it, with more than 300 contributors in the last year and 20,000 stars on GitHub.
The startup’s three co-founders worked together on a previous startup called Luckey that was acquired by Airbnb. It was a sort of mini CRM for Airbnb guests and hosts, specifically designed for vacation rentals.
When it was time to leave and start a new startup, they looked at the tech industry and noticed a trend. For the past few years, there has been a wave of open source startups replicating popular software-as-a-service products with a community-oriented approach. Baserow is trying to replicate Airtable. Documenso is working on a Docusign alternative. Formbricks has released a Qualtrics competitor. And the list goes on.
“And I realized that CRM is the biggest software market overall, because it covers marketing, customer support, operations — a CRM does everything,” Twenty co-founder and CEO Félix Malfait told TechCrunch.
Arguably, some companies have already tried to build an open source CRM and take on Salesforce, such as SugarCRM. While SugarCRM has been quite successful, SugarCRM never reached the success of Salesforce or HubSpot. The company also stopped releasing its Community Edition in 2018.
“They didn’t see the point of open source at the time, it was more of a constraint. I think that’s because there was no GitHub, there was no community,” Malfait said.
The world of open source has changed, and CRMs, too. These platforms are no longer designed for sales teams exclusively. Many companies use their CRM as the main repository for customer data and build products on top of that data.
“I think that in every category, there will be an open source leader, and the more a category depends on network effects, ecosystems, and extensibility, the more effective open source will be,” Malfait said. “We’re not there yet, but that’s what I believe. It’s my long-term thesis,” he added.
That’s why Twenty is trying to build a flexible platform that can be tweaked to every company’s needs and that can serve as a basis for other tools and use cases. Each entry in a CRM is an object. It can be a standard, pre-defined object like a person or a company. But customers can also create their own custom objects.
If you’re a conference organizer, you can create a conference object. If you’re a restaurant chain manager, you can create a restaurant object. As you may have guessed, Twenty also lets you create custom fields for each object. This way, it’s easier to capture and compare data across multiple entries.
This customer data can be viewed in Twenty directly in list or Kanban views. People can sort and filter entries, add tasks and notes, all the usual CRM stuff.
But data in Twenty can also be reused with GraphQL and REST APIs. And that’s how you can extend Twenty beyond its CRM roots. Eventually, Twenty hopes there will be an active ecosystem of developers working on extensions and plugins to build a proper alternative to the Salesforce product suite. But we’re not there yet.
“Building a CRM is a daunting task, especially for us because of the way we’ve chosen to do it. We’re building a platform, and we’re not taking any shortcut. In fact, we still need to work on workflows, on automation and more,” Malfait said.
Twenty has raised two small funding rounds representing $5 million in total with around 50 different investors, including Mathilde Collin (Front founder), Dharmesh Shah (HubSpot founder), Pierre Burgy and Aurélien Georget (Strapi founders), and Sergei Anikin (former CEO/CTO at Pipedrive). The company is also backed by Runa Capital, Y Combinator and Automattic.
“People often don’t understand why Salesforce is so big, so powerful,” Malfait said. Salesforce, as a platform, is a flexible data model, a programming language called Apex to execute code on Salesforce’s servers and a front-end customization framework.
“So when you have these three bricks you can store data, do logic on the back end, and display the result as you like,” Malfait said. “It means that you can do everything. And that’s what we want to enable in the long term.”"

The deal, announced on Monday, will see Happay’s expense management business and team transition to MakeMyTrip, while the payments division will remain at CRED. The financial terms were not disclosed and couldn’t be immediately learned.
CRED, which had acquired Happay in a $180 million deal in late 2021, will also retain Happay’s B2B payments technology stack that recently launched solutions on Bharat Connect.
The deal is aimed at bolstering MakeMyTrip’s corporate travel offerings, which already serve 59,000 small and medium-sized businesses through its MyBiz platform and 450 large enterprises via Quest2Travel.
The transaction, expected to close within 90 days, will integrate Happay’s expertise serving 900 corporate clients with MakeMyTrip’s travel services."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/openais-tumultuous-early-years-revealed-in-emails-from-musk-altman-and-others/,"OpenAI's tumultuous early years revealed in emails from Musk, Altman, and others | TechCrunch",Devin Coldewey,2024-11-15,"A lawsuit by the world’s wealthiest man against one of the fastest growing companies of all time is necessarily interesting stuff. But while the allegations are yet to be proven, the case has already exposed a batch of emails between Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others during OpenAI’s early days. Here are a few of the more interesting snippets we found while perusing their correspondence.
Bear in mind that these emails were exposed as part of an attempt to prove OpenAI is somehow breaking antitrust law (a frankly implausible allegation). Musk is also revealing to some extent his feeling of betrayal when OpenAI abandoned its original vision of being a nonprofit with the Tesla CEO as its leader.
They do not tell the whole story, but they are still interesting in their own right.
Perhaps the most interesting single email is former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever explaining the team’s qualms with Musk as leader of the company:
The current structure provides you with a path where you end up with unilateral absolute control over the AGI [artificial general intelligence]. You stated that you don’t want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you’ve shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you.
As an example, you said that you needed to be CEO of the new company so that everyone will know that you are the one who is in charge, even though you also stated that you hate being CEO and would much rather not be CEO.
Thus, we are concerned that as the company makes genuine progress towards AGI, you will choose to retain your absolute control of the company despite current intent to the contrary.
The goal of OpenAI is to make the future good and to avoid an AGI dictatorship. You are concerned that Demis [Hassabis, at Google-owned DeepMind] could create an AGI dictatorship. So do we. So it is a bad idea to create a structure where you could become a dictator if you chose to, especially given that we can create some other structure that avoids this possibility.
This isn’t entirely about corporate control; Sutskever is worried about an existential AI threat being created with only one person in the way.
Sutskever also voices worries about Altman, using words much like the board would later use while accusing him of not being “consistently candid”:
We haven’t been able to fully trust your judgements throughout this process, because we don’t understand your cost function.
We don’t understand why the CEO title is so important to you. Your stated reasons have changed, and it’s hard to really understand what’s driving it.
Is AGI truly your primary motivation? How does it connect to your political goals?
Given the way things have played out and Altman’s steering of the company toward a much more traditional enterprise SaaS position, it seems like his goal was more business than philosophy.
One interesting tidbit is that as early as 2017, OpenAI was seriously considering buying chipmaker Cerebras, or somehow merging with it, potentially using Tesla’s resources somehow. As Sutskever puts it:
In the event we decide to buy Cerebras, my strong sense is that it’ll be done through Tesla.
They ended up not going through with it, though the reason why is not in these emails.
This, by the way, was back when Musk was angling to have OpenAI be just one of his many properties, and the leaders were open to that possibility. As OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy wrote:
The most promising option I can think of, as I mentioned earlier, would be for OpenAI to attach to Tesla as its cash cow. […] If we do this really well, the transportation industry is large enough that we could increase Tesla’s market cap to high O(~100K), and use that revenue to fund the AI work at the appropriate scale.
Again, this didn’t happen for a lot of reasons that seem clear in hindsight. Tesla’s market cap did in fact increase, but the self-driving side of things — which Karpathy aimed to accelerate later when he took a job at Tesla — proved harder than expected, and has not yet contributed meaningfully to Tesla’s revenue.
As far as making money, Microsoft was in the mix from as early as 2016, offering OpenAI $60 million worth of compute on Azure in exchange for, among other things, the companies “evangelizing” one another. No one seemed into this kind of corporate back-scratching, and Musk wrote that it made him “nauseous.”
They ultimately ended up paying far more but with no obligation on either side. “Would be worth way more than $50M not to seem like Microsoft’s marketing bitch,” wrote Musk.
Lastly, a minor nugget mentioned by board member Shivon Zilis (who would later become mother to three of Musk’s children): Valve founder Gabe Newell was, in addition to being a donator to the project in the early days, on Altman and Greg Brockman’s “informal advisory board.” It’s unclear what role he had or has in the day-to-day there. I’ve asked Newell for comment."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-x-competitor/,What is Bluesky? Everything to know about the X competitor.,"Amanda Silberling, Cody Corrall, Alyssa Stringer",2024-11-15,"Is the grass greener on the other side? We’re not sure, but the sky is most certainly bluer. It’s been two years since Elon Musk purchased Twitter, now X, leading people to set up shop on alternative platforms. Mastodon, Post, Pebble (two of which have already shuttered operations) and Spill have been presented as potential replacements, but few aside from Meta’s Threads have achieved the speed of growth Bluesky has reached.
After being invite-only for almost a year, Bluesky became open to anyone in February 2024 and gained almost 800,000 new users in a day. As of November 2024, Bluesky has more than 16 million users. Its growth stems from several policy changes at X, including a heavily criticized change to the block feature and allowing third-party companies to train their AI on users’ posts, which helped the app soar into the top 5 apps in the U.S. App Store. Bluesky also saw a big boost following the results of the 2024 U.S. presidential election (which also contributed to an X exodus by Taylor Swift fans). But while the number is promising, the network has a lot of catching up to do to compete with Threads’ 275 million monthly active users.
Bluesky is a decentralized social app conceptualized by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and developed in parallel with Twitter. The social network has a Twitter-like user interface with algorithmic choice, a federated design and community-specific moderation.
Bluesky is using an open source framework built in-house, the AT Protocol, meaning people outside of the company have transparency into how it is built and what is being developed.
Dorsey introduced the Bluesky project back in 2019 while he was still Twitter CEO. At the time, he said Twitter would be funding a “small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers,” charged with building a decentralized standard for social media, with the original goal that Twitter would adopt this standard itself. But that was before Elon Musk bought the platform, so Bluesky is completely divorced from Twitter.
As of May 2024, Dorsey is no longer on Bluesky’s board. Bluesky is now an independent public benefit corporation led by CEO Jay Graber.
Upon signing up, users can create a handle which is then represented as @username.bsky.social as well as a display name that appears more prominent in bold text. If you’re so inclined, you can turn a domain name that you own into your username — so, for example, I’m known on Bluesky as @amanda.omg.lol.
The app itself functions much like a bare-bones Twitter, where you can click a plus button to create a post of 256 characters, which can also include photos. Posts themselves can be replied to, retweeted, liked and, from a three-dot menu, reported, shared via the iOS Share Sheet to other apps, or copied as text.
You can search for and follow other individuals, then view their updates in your “Home” timeline. Previously, the Bluesky app would feature popular posts in a “What’s Hot” feed. That feed has since been replaced with an algorithmic and personalized “Discover” feed featuring more than just trending content.
For new users, Bluesky introduced a “Starter Pack” feature, which creates a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow in order to find interesting content right out of the gate.
User profiles contain the same sort of features you’d expect: a profile pic, background, bio, metrics and how many people they’re following. Profile feeds are divided into two sections, like Twitter: posts and posts & replies.
There is also a “Discover” tab in the bottom center of the app’s navigation, which offers more “who to follow” suggestions and a running feed of recently posted Bluesky updates.
We’ve also put together a helpful guide on how to use Bluesky here.
By the beginning of July 2023, when Instagram’s Threads launched, Bluesky topped a million downloads across iOS and Android. Notable figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mark Cuban, Dril, Weird Al Yankovic, and even Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva have migrated to Bluesky. It’s also home to news organizations like Bloomberg, The Washington Post, and of course, TechCrunch! Since August 2024, Bluesky is also now allowing heads of state to sign up and join the platform for the first time.
In many ways, yes. Up until recently, Bluesky did not have DMs like X, but that has since been implemented. However, DMs on Bluesky are currently limited to one-to-one messages, not group messages. Bluesky has also said it is interested in implementing something similar to X’s Community Notes feature. Additionally, X does not use a decentralized protocol like ActivityPub or AT.
In October 2024, Elon Musk announced that X’s block feature would work differently than it has in the past. The new block functionality allows users you have blocked to view your posts and your profile, but not the ability to interact with your posts. Some users believe this update to be a safety concern, leading to an influx in Bluesky sign-ups as its block feature is more traditional.
While Bluesky was initially kicked off as a project convened by Jack Dorsey in 2019 when he was CEO of Twitter, the social app has been an independent company since its inception in 2021.
Yes, and it is now open to the public.
Bluesky’s goal is to find another means to sustain its network outside of advertising with paid services, so it can remain free to end users. On July 5, 2023, Bluesky announced additional seed round funding and a paid service that provides custom domains for end users who want to have a unique domain as their handle on the service. Bluesky has also emphasized that it does not want to “require selling user data for ads” in order to monetize its platform.
In November 2024, Bluesky announced it raised a $15 million Series A round and is developing a subscription service for premium features like “higher quality video uploads or profile customizations.” Bluesky, however, noted its subscription model will not follow in the footsteps of X’s “pay to win” premium offerings.
Yes. Bluesky’s team is developing the decentralized AT Protocol, which Bluesky was built atop. In its beta phase, users can only join the bsky.social network, but Bluesky plans to be federated, meaning that endless individually operated communities can exist within the open source network. So, if a developer outside of Bluesky built their own new social app using the AT Protocol, Bluesky users could jump over to the new app and port over their existing followers, handle and data.
“You’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too,” a Bluesky blog post explained.
In October 2023, Bluesky added email verification as part of a larger effort to improve account security and authentication on the network. The addition is an important step forward in terms of making Bluesky more competitive with larger networks like X, which have more robust security controls. In December 2023, Bluesky allowed users to opt out of a change that would expose their posts to the public web following backlash from users.
Yes. In May 2023, Bluesky released custom algorithms, which it calls “custom feeds.” Custom feeds allow users to subscribe to multiple different algorithms that showcase different kinds of posts a user may want to see. You can pin custom feeds that will show up at the top of your timeline as different tabs to pick from. The feeds you pin, or save, are located under the “My Feeds” menu in the app’s sidebar.
In March 2024,​​ the company announced “AT Protocol Grants,” a new program that will dole out small grants to developers in order to foster growth and customization. One of the recipients, SkyFeed, is a custom tool that lets anyone build their own feeds using a graphical user interface.
Yes. Bluesky rolled out to Android users on April 20 and was initially launched to iOS users in late February. Users can access Bluesky on the web here.
After an October 2023 update, the app will now warn users of misleading links by flagging them. If links shared in users’ posts don’t match their text, the app will offer a “possibly misleading” warning to the user to alert them that the link may be directing them somewhere they don’t want to go.
Bluesky has been embattled with moderation issues since its first launch. The app has been accused of failing to protect its marginalized users and failing to moderate racist content. Following a controversy about the app allowing racial slurs in account handles, frustrated users initiated a “posting strike,” where they refused to engage with the platform until it established guardrails to flag slurs and other offensive terms in usernames.
A December 2023 post from the Bluesky Safety account announced a large batch of moderation updates.
Bluesky is rolling out “more advanced automated tooling” designed to flag content that violates its Community Guidelines that will then be reviewed by the app’s moderation team.
Bluesky launched moderation features similar to ones on X, including user lists and moderation lists, the latter of which can be used to mute or block many users at once. The app is also developing a feature that lets users limit who can reply to posts.
Some Bluesky users are still advocating for the ability to set their accounts to private — a feature they have an increased need for after Bluesky announced it would launch a public web interface.
In March 2024, the company launched Ozone, a tool that lets users create and run their own independent moderation services that will give users “unprecedented control” over their social media experience.
Though Bluesky’s architecture is similar to Mastodon’s, many users have found Bluesky to be more intuitive, while Mastodon can come off as inaccessible: Choosing which instance to join feels like an impossible task on Mastodon, and longtime users are very defensive about their established posting norms, which can make joining the conversation intimidating. To remain competitive, Mastodon recently simplified its sign-up flow, making mastodon.social the default server for new users.
However, the launch of federation will make it work more similarly to Mastodon in that users can pick and choose which servers to join and move their accounts around at will.
Though Jack Dorsey funded Bluesky, he is not involved in day-to-day development and no longer sits on the company’s board. The CEO of Bluesky is Jay Graber, who previously worked as a software engineer for the cryptocurrency Zcash, then founded an event-planning site called Happening.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/healthcare-vc-firm-initiate-has-a-new-45m-and-has-already-founded-five-startups-internally/,Healthcare VC firm Initiate has a new $45M and has already founded five startups internally | TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,2024-11-18,"Jessica Owens and Iana Dimkova, co-founders of Initiate Ventures, are launching their new healthcare/ life sciences-focused firm with a respectable $45 million debut fund.
One of the ways they convinced limited partners to become investors is because they are building a combination early-stage and incubation firm. So not only will they invest in early-stage startups at the intersection of tech and life sciences but they will also pursue incubating some startups companies in-house, aka finding founders to turn ideas into companies.
Incubation “is a model that’s worked really well for life sciences in the past,” Dimkova said, citing firms like Flagship Pioneering, which launched Moderna. “Their entire investment strategy is actually backed by incubations and following those companies as they scale.”
While some venture firms incubate tech startups, including health tech startups, Initiate’s focus on the health and life sciences area is what sets the firm apart, Dimkova said.
Initiate co-founders, who will split their time and efforts between their investing in existing seed and Series A companies – checks range from $500,000 to $3 million – and launching new companies through their venture studio. One of them will typically take the role of an interim CEO at inception.
They have the bona fides to tackle this kind of firm. Each of them has spent nearly two decades as entrepreneurs and investors in healthcare.
Prior to launching Initiate, Owens (pictured right above) co-founded Grail, an early cancer detection company that was acquired by Illumina in 2020 for $8 billion. She also held executive roles in several other startups and was a healthcare investor with Kleiner Perkins during the late 2000s.
Meanwhile, Dimkova (pictured left above) was an investor at GE Ventures, a corporate venture fund, which was one of the most active health technology investors in the 2000s and early last decade. Before that, she was an early team member at ProCure Treatment Center, a nationwide radiation therapy practice.
Initiate’s venture studio has already founded five startups, and four of these companies have already secured follow-on financing either from Initiate themselves or other VC firms. One such company includes Persana, an esthetic and plastic surgery concierge that provides advice and matches patients with top practitioners throughout the U.S.
The firm’s other investments include Macro Trials, a clinical trials platform that matches pharmaceutical companies with participants, especially people with diverse backgrounds; Cornerstone AI, a startup that uses AI to automate the cleaning of healthcare data in electronic health records, healthcare registries, claims, and clinical trials. Initiate also has several companies that are still in stealth, including a non-oncology-focused liquid biopsy startup."

He’s always loved tech gadgets. During an episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, when asked about his latest gadgets, he showed off his Oura ring. But then he considered and said that his favorite gadget these days is his car. “I think my car is really advanced,” he said. He especially loves GM’s OnStar — GM is a Salesforce customer.
When pressed on which make and model he loves, the billionaire admitted that he has many cars, loves them all. Because he spends a lot of time on his estate on the Island of Hawaii (the “Big Island”) in essentially a rural area — where he was during the podcast call — he’s also gotten into trucks lately.
“I love trucks right now. So I’ve got a lot of trucks. I’ve got the GM trucks. I’ve got the new Silverado auto. I have the Hummer EV. I’ve got two Ford Lightnings. They’re amazing,” he said of the electric F150.
One of the reasons he has so many new vehicles is that he’s been pitching Salesforce’s AI agent tech to the tech leaders of all these companies. All of the brands are Salesforce customers, as is Toyota, a fact he acknowledged by jokingly saying, “I love all my children.”
He has also ordered a new Volkswagen EV Bus, which hasn’t been delivered yet.
“Yeah, that one’s fun,” he said.
Correction: This article has been updated to correct the island in Hawaii where Benioff’s estate is located."

AI in the confessional | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-11-18,"We’ve seen AI chatbots in religious apps before, but a chapel in Lucerne, Switzerland, has gone further — putting artificial intelligence inside a confessional. DW’s report shows the “AI Jesus” in action dispensing machine-generated spiritual advice via an avatar visible inside the wooden enclosure. Parishioners sitting on the other side interact with the AI by pressing a button and voicing their question or concern.
The tech, developed at the local university, is described by the chapel’s theologian as an experiment intended to spark discussion. He points out one advantage: AI can be available 24/7, unlike human pastors.
“I was surprised. It was so easy!” enthused one parishioner interviewed in the report. “Though it’s a machine, it gave me so much advice.”
Others were less impressed: “I see it as a gimmick,” said one after recounting the AI’s stock response to a question about ending violence.
Priests probably shouldn’t hang up their cassocks just yet, especially as the AI warns parishioners not to share any personal data, such as sins."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/sam-altman-will-co-chair-the-new-mayor-of-san-franciscos-transition-team/,Sam Altman will co-chair San Francisco mayor-elect Daniel Lurie's transition team | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-11-18,"San Francisco’s mayor-elect, Daniel Lurie, has tapped OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to help run his transition team, the campaign announced on Monday, as part of the administration’s effort to embrace the tech industry. Altman, alongside nine other San Francisco leaders, will provide guidance to Lurie’s team on ways the city can innovate, and help the new mayor develop relationships with key partners.
“I’m excited to help the city I love, and where OpenAI was started, as it begins its next chapter with Mayor-elect Lurie stepping into his new role,” said Altman in a statement to TechCrunch.
Lurie, an heir to the Levi Strauss fortune, has never held elected office and ran against incumbent Mayor London Breed as an outsider to the rough-and-tumble nature of San Francisco politics. He personally invested nearly $9 million to fund his campaign.
When Lurie takes office on January 8, he’ll be tasked with addressing San Francisco’s public safety crisis, an issue that has pushed many tech leaders away from the Bay Area. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who has invested millions in the city, has not been shy to criticize the city’s failures around public safety. Elon Musk closed X’s office in downtown San Francisco in August, citing similar concerns around drug use and crime. However, Musk’s AI startup moved into OpenAI’s old office in the city’s Mission District shortly thereafter.
Nevertheless, these issues have caused many Silicon Valley leaders to exit the area for younger tech hubs such as Miami or Austin — often with loud condemnations of city officials on their way out the door. A key job for San Francisco’s new mayor will be attracting young professionals to the city, and convincing current tech entrepreneurs to stay and build their companies here.
Apparently, the new mayor wants Sam Altman to help lead that effort. Lurie previously called OpenAI’s CEO “one of the most important figures on the planet,” in a recent interview with The Information, and said he wants Altman and other tech leaders to play a role in reinvigorating downtown San Francisco.
Another Silicon Valley native will join Altman on Lurie’s transition team: Ned Segal, Twitter’s former chief financial officer. Segal left Twitter, alongside former CEO Parag Agrawal, in 2022 following Elon Musk’s takeover of the social media company. Today, Segal sits on the board of several venture-backed companies, including Beyond Meat and RingCentral, as well as Lurie’s nonprofit, Tipping Point.
Tapping a tech executive to advise your administration just might be the next big thing in politics. On the national stage, President-elect Donald Trump recently announced Elon Musk will advise the White House as part of a new group meant to drive efficiency in the federal government. In both cases, Musk and Altman seem like they’ll have an outsized role on the political stage, but won’t need to divest from their financial interests.
Beyond running the world’s leading AI company, with multiple offices throughout San Francisco, Altman also ran the city’s famous startup incubator, Y Combinator, from 2014 to 2019. Altman could help Lurie curry favor with startups and YC itself, especially since its current CEO, Garry Tan, has given San Francisco’s new mayor a less-than-warm embrace.
“If Lurie wins I will watch his admin like a hawk and he will be relentlessly held accountable by me and all my friends,” said Y Combinator’s Garry Tan in a tweet from October.
Tan criticized Lurie for using his personal wealth to outspend his competitors.
That said, a nonprofit that Tan sits on the board of, Grow SF, endorsed Lurie in the mayoral race. Tan has also taken an increasingly large role in San Francisco’s politics in the last few years, and he’s seen as a leader to many of the young founders and engineers in the city.
Lurie may use Altman to win over Tan and other tech entrepreneurs who have grown skeptical of San Francisco’s leadership. Altman, on the other hand, may use the title to get a leg up in politics — a world OpenAI is slowly becoming more enveloped in as it matures.
Other transition team co-chairs include: former fire chief of the San Francisco Fire Department, Joanne Hayes-White; the Mission Asset Fund’s founding CEO, José A.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/perplexity-introduces-a-shopping-feature-for-pro-users/,Perplexity introduces a shopping feature for Pro users in the US | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-18,"AI-powered search engine Perplexity is venturing into e-commerce. On Monday, the company debuted a new shopping feature for its paid customers in the U.S. which offers shopping recommendations within Perplexity’s search results as well as the ability to place an order without going to a retailer’s website.
With the move, Perplexity is taking on Google and Amazon, intending to capture a portion of shopping search results.
For shopping-related search queries, the tool presents users with visual cards that have details of the product, pricing, and seller info, a short description, and the pros and cons of the item in question. Users can click or tap on the card to read more information, including reviews and detailed key features.
Consumers can also store their address and credit card details in Perplexity for easy checkout. The company says it calculates taxes for your address, so you can purchase an item with one click. The company said Pro subscribers will get free shipping for items purchased through its one-click checkout system. For now, the search engine’s recommendations are “unbiased” as there are no sponsored slots, Perplexity notes.
The new search experience is powered by integrations with sellers’ sites, including those on Shopify. The latter unlocks information on all sellers using Shopify who are shipping items in the U.S.
The feature also provides a way for users to search by adding a photo of an item that they want along with their query. This is similar to Google which has also offered various iterations of a product that allows you to combine images and text in a search box.
Alongside the launch of its shopping tools, Perplexity is introducing a merchant program.
If merchants enroll in this program, they’ll have a better chance of being a recommended product because the company will have more complete information in its index. People can also use a one-click checkout to buy items from the company’s merchant partners, the company said.
Merchants will have free API access to power search on their own websites, as well, which could help Perplexity gain market share in this space. The company said it’s not taking an affiliate cut from user purchases at the moment. Plus, it clarified that the shopping feature is separate from its ads product, which was introduced last week.
Apart from Big Tech, startups like Daydream, Deft, and Remark have also raised millions of dollars from venture capitalists to build AI-powered shopping searches.
Amazon debuted AI-powered assistant Rufus earlier this year in the U.S. and expanded to other countries late last month. After its Prime Day sales event in July, the company noted that Rufus helped “millions” of customers find the right items. Google also primed its Shopping tab with AI in October for better search results.
With the onset of large language models, companies working in the e-commerce industry have realized that there is an opportunity to suggest better options as these models can parse user queries and match items from the catalog using organized and unorganized data.
The promise of this new wave of search is that e-commerce search has been bad for years, but now you can write long sentences to describe an item you need, and AI will do the work for you.
These companies are also betting on the fact that AI will help you find an item quickly, and you won’t need to spend a lot of time looking for something. But this premise comes with an implicit caveat: You should trust the limited search results that AI tools serve you. To build trust, the companies providing these tools will have to make sure to remove implicit bias and preferential treatment before regulators intervene."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/google-org-commits-20m-to-researchers-using-ai-for-scientific-breakthroughs/,Google.org commits $20M to researchers using AI for scientific breakthroughs | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-11-18,"Google is committing $20 million in cash and $2 million in cloud credits to a new funding initiative designed to help scientists and researchers unearth the next great scientific breakthroughs using artificial intelligence (AI).
The announcement, made by Google DeepMind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis during a fireside chat at the closed-door AI for Science Forum in London today, feeds into a broader push by Big Tech to curry favor with young innovators and startups, a strategy that has included acqui-hires, equity investments, and cloud partnerships — some of which has attracted the attentions of regulators.
This latest announcement, via Google’s 19-year-old philanthropic arm Google.org, is different in that it centers on non-equity funding for academic and non-for-profit institutions globally. But similar to other Big Tech funding and partnership initiatives, this will go some way toward helping Google ingratiate itself with some of the leading scientific minds, through direct cash injections and by providing infrastructure to power their projects. In turn, this positions Google well to acquire future customers — particularly those currently on the cusp of doing great things, working on projects that require significant AI tooling and compute, which Google can provide.
Google isn’t alone in this approach — just last week, Amazon’s cloud leader AWS announced $110 million in grants and credits to lure AI researchers into its own ecosystem. Elsewhere, Google itself has made other similar commitments in the AI sphere of late, including a $20 million fund to support think tanks and academic institutions building out their AI expertise, and a similar-size fund to run a generative AI accelerator program for nonprofits.
The one thing winning applicants should have in common is that they will be using “AI to address increasingly complex problems at the intersections of different disciplines of science,” according to an accompanying blog post from Maggie Johnson, Google VP and global head of Google.org,
“Fields such as rare and neglected disease research, experimental biology, materials science and sustainability all show promise,” Johnson wrote.
In response to some follow-up questions from TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that they don’t have a set target in terms of the number of projects they’re looking to finance. However, they stressed that they want the funding to be “significant enough to fuel scientific breakthroughs” — this means it’s not looking to pepper small pockets of cash far and wide. Instead, it’s likely to be dispersed around no more than around 15 organizations, with plans to select the recipients and give out the funding by 2026.
It’s worth noting that it has been a big year for Google’s AI unit DeepMind itself. Hassabis, one of DeepMind’s three founders, was awarded a knighthood for services to AI back in March. Then in October, Hassabis and DeepMind director John Jumper (pictured together above) scooped one half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on AlphaFold, which has helped accelerate research around drug discovery, diagnosing diseases, and bioengineering.
This newest fund essentially seeks to build off that momentum.
“I believe artificial intelligence will help scientists and researchers achieve some of the greatest breakthroughs of our time,” Hassabis said in a stock statement issued to TechCrunch. “We hope the launch of our $20 million fund will help encourage further collaboration between the private and public sectors, kick-start renewed excitement for the power of AI and science, and inspire others to join us in funding this important work.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/ex-duolingo-execs-raise-13m-to-launch-startup-democratize-access-to-college-education/,Ex-Duolingo execs raise $13M for a startup that's making it easier to access a college education | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-11-18,"As college tuition increases and the student loan debt crisis continues, three former executives from language learning app Duolingo are building a new startup aimed at making college education more affordable and accessible.
The company, tentatively named Outsmart Education (the name is not final yet), is headed by co-founders Daniel Falabella (CPO), former senior director of product for learning at Duolingo; Gina Gotthilf (CMO), former vice president of growth and marketing at Duolingo; and Jorge Mazal (CEO), ex-chief product officer at Duolingo.
Outsmart announced its $13 million seed funding round on Monday, led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from Karman Ventures, Latitud Ventures, and Lightspeed Ventures, as well as angel investors, including Lenny Ratchinsky (ex-product lead at Airbnb) and 20Growth, among others. The capital will be used for hiring and product development.
The idea for Outsmart came out of Mazal’s own frustration with the current system, he says. When Mazal moved to the U.S. to pursue his undergraduate degree, he didn’t have the resources to pay for it and had to find a way to finance his education through a combination of jobs, scholarships, and other means. When he went on to complete two master’s programs at Harvard and Wharton, he didn’t realize how much debt he would end up with.
“I was like a quarter million dollars in debt,” Mazal told TechCrunch. “I had to take a part-time job where I was picking up trash in my apartment complex every morning just to make ends meet, and, to me, that was just so representative of what’s broken in higher ed.”
Because the company is currently operating in stealth mode, it’s not yet able to share its specific plans. Despite this, the venture shows promise given the caliber of its backers.
“College-level education is a basic, universal human right,” Ethan Choi, partner at Khosla Ventures, told TechCrunch. “I’m actually a first-generation college student myself. Education has completely transformed my life and will impact my family for generations…I just think what [Outsmart is] doing will be world-changing.”
Outsmart arrives at a time when many families find it hard to pay for a college degree. For the 2024-2025 school year, the average tuition and fees at private ranked colleges rose by around 5.5% over the last year, whereas public schools saw a rise of over 2%. Overall, Americans owe approximately $1.6 trillion in student loans.
Mazal told us, “The mission that we’re trying to achieve is to dramatically increase access to higher education in a way that’s been unprecedented and that we believe can change the world.”
Many companies aim to help college students get access to affordable education, including platforms that compare college tuition fees, such as Tuition Tracker, as well as companies that offer inexpensive online schooling. There are also matchmaking platforms, like College Rover and College Simply, that help students determine which college is the best fit for them.
Since Outsmart is keeping the details of its offering under wraps, it remains unclear how, or if, it fits into these existing categories. Regardless, the founders themselves appear to be well-equipped to forge a path in the space. The trio worked at Duolingo for five years and have previously held positions at various other notable companies. Falabella has experience at Dropbox and Lucid Software, while Gotthilf previously worked at Tumblr. Mazal has worked at Lucid, MyFitnessPal, and Zynga.
Mazal believes Outsmart will be “better than the higher ed options out there in basically every dimension, in terms of access, affordability, and personalization,” he said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/cisa-director-jen-easterly-to-depart-agency-on-january-20/,CISA Director Jen Easterly to depart agency on January 20 | TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,2024-11-18,"Jen Easterly, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), will depart the government agency after more than three years at the helm.
Both Easterly and the agency’s deputy director Nitin Natarajan will depart CISA on January 20 as the new Trump administration begins, according to NextGov, which first reported the departures, citing sources.
CISA spokesperson Antonio Soliz confirmed the executive leadership departures in an email to TechCrunch. “All appointees of the Biden Administration will vacate their positions by the time the new Administration takes office at noon on January 20,” said Soliz.
Easterly is the second director to lead CISA since the agency’s founding in 2018. Soon after taking office, the Biden administration nominated Easterly in April 2021 to head the cybersecurity agency, filling the eight-month vacancy left behind after then-President Trump fired the agency’s first director, Chris Krebs, for publicly debunking Trump’s false claims that the 2020 U.S. election was rigged.
During Easterly’s tenure at CISA, the cybersecurity agency pioneered new initiatives aimed at encouraging device makers to secure their products and technologies by default, and continued to educate and inform the wider industry of cybersecurity risks, all the while helping to defend the U.S. government from Russian-backed hacks and Chinese hacking groups targeting U.S. critical infrastructure.
CISA was also key in helping to support the Ukrainian government against the full and wide-scale invading Russian forces, including cyberattacks, in 2022.
Prior to CISA, Easterly served as the head of Morgan Stanley’s cybersecurity division, and previously held several senior positions in the U.S. Army, the National Security Agency, and U.S. Cyber Command.
The Trump administration’s transition team has not yet said who it will pick, if anyone, to head CISA from January 20."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/india-fines-meta-25-4-million-over-whatsapp-privacy-policy/,"India orders Meta to curb WhatsApp data sharing, levies $25M fine | TechCrunch",Manish Singh,2024-11-18,"India’s competition watchdog has ordered WhatsApp to stop sharing user data with other Meta units for advertising purposes for five years and also levied a fine of $25.4 million for antitrust violations related to WhatsApp’s controversial 2021 privacy policy.
The Competition Commission of India, which began the investigation in 2021, found that WhatsApp’s “take-it-or-leave-it” privacy update constituted an abuse of Meta’s dominant position by forcing users to accept expanded data collection without an opt-out option.
WhatsApp’s 2021 privacy policy update required users to share their data with Meta companies in order to continue using the messaging service, removing a previous opt-out option that had existed since 2016. The mandatory data-sharing requirement expanded the scope of data collection and processing by Meta’s group companies.
The watchdog determined that Meta was dominant in two key markets: so-called “over-the-top” messaging apps through smartphones in India, and online display advertising.
It concluded that WhatsApp’s mandatory data-sharing created entry barriers for Meta’s rivals and resulted in denial of market access in the display advertising market.
In addition to the monetary penalty, the CCI mandated significant changes to WhatsApp’s data practices in India.
The messaging platform must provide users with detailed explanations of what data is shared with Meta companies and for what purpose. It must also give users prominent opt-out options through in-app notifications and settings menus, applying these changes to both new and existing users who accepted the 2021 update.
The ruling represents the latest regulatory challenge for Meta in India, where WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly active users."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/ai-training-software-firm-ilearningengines-says-it-lost-250000-in-recent-cyberattack/,"AI training software firm iLearningEngines says it lost $250,000 in recent cyberattack | TechCrunch",Carly Page,2024-11-18,"U.S.-based iLearningEngines, a provider of AI training software for enterprises, has alerted regulators to a cyberattack that allowed hackers to break into its network and steal $250,000 worth of company funds.
In an 8-K regulatory filing on Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, iLearningEngines said it had experienced a “cybersecurity incident” that saw an unnamed threat actor recently access the organization’s network. The company said once inside the company’s network, the hacker “misdirected a $250,000 wire payment,” which iLearningEngines has not been able to recover.
The company did not say exactly when the incident occurred, nor specify the nature of the cyberattack. But, the company’s description of a misdirected wire payment suggests the company fell victim to a business email compromise, or BEC attack, whereby an attacker compromises or manipulates email accounts to steal funds from a company or its employees. BEC scams often target companies that conduct wire transfers, or have suppliers and vendors abroad.
According to the filing, the hacker also deleted a number of email messages and accessed “certain files” on iLearningEngines’ network. The company hasn’t confirmed which files were accessed and has not yet responded to TechCrunch’s questions.
iLearningEngines says it has incurred and “may continue to incur” certain expenses related to the cybersecurity incident, and expects it to have a material impact on its operations during its fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2024.  The company said it lost $314 million on revenues of $135 million during its fiscal second quarter.
The company, which describes itself as an “AI-powered learning automation” firm, went public in April 2024, and says it serves more than 1,000 enterprise customers."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/beyonce-to-perform-live-on-netflix-during-nfl-christmas-gameday-stream/,Beyoncé to perform live on Netflix during NFL Christmas Gameday stream | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-11-18,"Beyoncé is headed to Netflix. The singer will perform live during the halftime show during the Houston Texans vs. Baltimore Ravens Christmas Day game, which is set to be streamed on Netflix as part of its newly minted three-year deal with the NFL.
“Your early Christmas wish has been granted as Beyoncé will perform during Netflix’s first-ever NFL Christmas Gameday live on Netflix this December 25,” Netflix shared in an announcement.
The streamer is set to host two live games on Christmas, starting with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers at 1 p.m. ET, followed by the Baltimore Ravens vs. the Houston Texans at 4:30 p.m. ET, where Beyoncé will perform during the halftime show.
The show will include songs from her hit country album “Cowboy Carter,” which is being performed live for the first time. The album garnered a record-breaking 11 Grammy nominations this year, making it the most-nominated album of all time. Beyoncé also teased her performance with a video trailer posted online, featuring “Ameriican Requiem,” the first song on the album.
Details about her upcoming performance are under wraps, but Netflix said she’s “expected to feature some special guests who are featured on the Cowboy Carter album,” which could range from Dolly Parton to the country sensation Shaboozey.
This is technically the third halftime show Beyoncé has performed, after taking the stage at two Super Bowl games. Her latest performance will give Netflix a chance to redeem itself after the glitches that took place this weekend during its livestream of the boxing match between YouTuber Jake Paul and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.
Netflix said 60 million households watched the live fight and it quickly became evident that the match was a test of its livestreaming infrastructure. More than 1 million reports from across 50 different countries were filed to Downdetector, which offers a window into telecommunication outages. The hashtag #NetflixCrash was also trending on X during the event. Last year, Netflix faced issues with its livestream of the Season 4 Reunion of “Love Is Blind,” which crashed and experienced an hours-long delay.
To its credit, Netflix has had livestreaming successes, including the broadcasting of major award ceremonies and sports matches. The NFL Christmas Day games next month will be the first live events since the Paul-Tyson match."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/meta-brings-certain-ai-features-to-ray-ban-meta-glasses-in/,Meta brings certain AI features to Ray-Ban Meta glasses in Europe | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-18,"After a brief delay, Meta says that it’s begun to roll out certain AI features to users of its Ray-Ban Meta AR glasses in France, Italy, and Spain.
Starting today, people in those countries can invoke Meta’s AI assistant, Meta AI, using their voice to get answers to general questions (e.g. “What are some good gift ideas for my kids aged 6 and 8?”). Meta AI now supports French, Italian, and Spanish in addition to English as part of the update, Meta says.
“Since we launched in September 2023, we have been diligently working to ensure that Ray-Ban Meta glasses comply with Europe’s complex regulatory system,” the company wrote in a blog post. “We are excited to begin bringing Meta AI and its innovative features to parts of the EU and look forward to expanding to more European countries soon.”
The upgrade won’t include multimodal features available on Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the U.S., Canada, and Australia — namely the ability to get answers to questions about what’s in view of the glasses’ camera (e.g. “Tell me more about this landmark”). Meta says it’s working to bring multimodality to more countries “in the future.”
Meta has previously expressed concerns about its ability to comply with the AI Act, the EU law that establishes a legal and regulatory framework for AI — calling the law’s implementation “too unpredictable.” Also at issue for the company are provisions in the GDPR, the EU’s privacy law, pertaining to AI training. Meta trains AI models, including the models that power features of its Ray-Ban Meta glasses, on the public data of Instagram and Facebook users who haven’t opted out — data that in Europe is subject to GDPR guarantees.
EU regulators earlier this year requested that Meta halt training on European user data while they assessed the company’s GDPR compliance. Meta relented, while at the same time endorsing an open letter calling for “a modern interpretation” of GDPR that doesn’t “reject progress.”
In early fall, Meta said that it would resume training on U.K. user data after “[incorporating] regulatory feedback” into a revised opt-out process. And shortly afterward, the company brought select AI capabilities to Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the U.K. (as well as six other countries). But Meta has yet to share an update on its model training practices throughout the rest of the bloc."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/superannotate-helps-companies-manage-their-ai-data-sets/,SuperAnnotate helps companies manage their AI datasets | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-18,"High-quality data may be the key to high-quality AI. With studies finding that dataset curation, rather than size, is what really affects an AI model’s performance, it’s unsurprising that there’s a growing emphasis on dataset management practices. According to some surveys, AI researchers today spend much of their time on data prep and organization tasks.
Brothers Vahan Petrosyan and Tigran Petrosyan felt the pain of having to manage lots of data while training algorithms in college. Vahan went so far as to create a data management tool during his PhD research on image segmentation.
A few years later, Vahan realized that developers — and even corporations — would happily pay for similar tooling. So the brothers founded a company, SuperAnnotate, to build it.
“During the explosion of innovation in 2023 surrounding models and multimodal AI, the need for high-quality datasets became more stringent, with each organization having multiple use cases requiring specialized data,” Vahan said in a statement. “We saw an opportunity to build an easy-to-use, low-code platform, like a Swiss Army Knife for modern AI training data.”
SuperAnnotate, whose clients include Databricks and Canva, helps users create and keep track of large AI training datasets. The startup initially focused on labeling software, but now provides tools for fine-tuning, iterating, and evaluating datasets.
With SuperAnnotate’s platform, users can connect data from local sources and the cloud to create data projects on which they can collaborate with teammates. From a dashboard, users can compare the performance of models by the data that was used to train them, and then deploy those models to various environments once they’re ready.
SuperAnnotate also provides companies access to a marketplace of crowd-sourced workers for data annotation tasks. Annotations are usually pieces of text labeling the meaning or parts of data that models train on, and serve as guideposts for models, “teaching” them to distinguish things, places and ideas.
To be frank, there are several Reddit threads about SuperAnnotate’s treatment of the data annotators it uses, and they aren’t flattering. Annotators complain about communication issues, unclear expectations, and low pay.
For its part, SuperAnnotate claims it pays fair market rates and that its demands on annotators aren’t outside the norm for the industry. We’ve asked the company to provide more detailed information about its practices and will update this piece if we hear back.
Edit: A few hours after this story was published, SuperAnnotate sent this statement via email: “About eight months ago, during a period of rapid scaling, we encountered challenges in maintaining clear communication with some annotators working on our projects. As is sometimes the case during rapid growth, a few process gaps emerged. We took this feedback seriously and have since made improvements to both how annotators interact with the platform and communication processes.”
There are several competitors in the AI data management space, including startups like Scale AI, Weka, and Dataloop. San Francisco-based SuperAnnotate has managed to hold its own, however, recently raising $36 million in a Series B round led by Socium Ventures, with participation from Nvidia, Databricks Ventures, and Play Time Ventures.
The fresh capital, which brings SuperAnnotate’s total raised to just over $53 million, will be used for augmenting its current team of around 100, for product R&D, and for growing SuperAnnotate’s customer base of roughly 100 companies.
“We aim to build a platform capable of fully adapting to enterprises’ evolving needs and offering extensive customization in data fine-tuning,” Vahan said.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/satellite-giant-maxar-confirms-hacker-accessed-employees-personal-data/,Space tech giant Maxar confirms hacker accessed employees' personal data | TechCrunch,Carly Page,2024-11-18,"U.S. space technology and satellite giant Maxar has confirmed a data breach involving the personal information of its employees, according to a filing with state regulators.
The Colorado-headquartered Maxar operates imaging satellites and manufactures spacecraft, and claims to operate one of the largest commercial satellite constellations on orbit. Maxar has long been a significant provider of commercial satellite imagery to the U.S. government, which uses the imagery for mission-critical planning, intelligence gathering, and disaster response.
In a required data breach notice filed with California’s attorney general last week, Maxar said a hacker using a Hong Kong-based IP address compromised its network on October 4 to access files containing employee’s personal data. It’s not yet known if the alleged hacker is located in Hong Kong, or used a server in Hong Kong to hide their real location.
Maxar said it discovered the breach a week later on October 11 and took “immediate action” to prevent further unauthorized access to the system. “Nevertheless, according to our investigation, the hacker likely had access to the files on the system for approximately one week before this action was taken,” Maxar said in the disclosure.
The information contained within the compromised files includes employees’ names, gender, physical addresses, Social Security numbers, business contact information, employment status, employee number, and job information, according to Maxar.
According to the company’s website, Maxar has 2,600 employees — more than half of which attained U.S. security clearances. These are required to perform classified work for the U.S. government, such as national security missions.
Maxar, which last year completed its $6.4 billion sale to private equity giant Advent International, hasn’t said how many of its employees were impacted by the breach.
Maxar spokesperson Kristin Carringer didn’t immediately respond to TechCrunch’s questions."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/moonvalley-wants-to-build-more-ethical-video-models/,Moonvalley wants to build more ethical video models | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-18,"The wide availability of tools to build generative AI has led to a Cambrian explosion of startups in the space. Plentiful capital hasn’t hurt, either — nor has the declining cost of the requisite technical infrastructure.
In fact, one of the flashiest applications of generative AI, generative video, risks becoming oversaturated. Labs such as Genmo, Haiper, and Rhymes AI are releasing models at a fast clip, and in some cases, little distinguishes them from the previous state-of-the-art.
Naeem Talukdar thinks that trust — not a model’s capabilities, necessarily — is what will set some generative video ventures apart from the rest. That’s why he’s founding Moonvalley, a Los Angeles-based startup that’s developing ostensibly more “transparent” generative video tools.
Talukdar led product growth at Zapier before founding a Y Combinator-backed company, Draft, that hosted a marketplace for enterprise AI content. He recruited Mateusz Malinowski and Mik Binkowski to launch Moonvalley — both former scientists at DeepMind, where they studied video generation techniques.
“We shared a belief that video generation was going to transform media and entertainment, but the startups we saw operating in the space didn’t have the necessary attributes to be successful,” Talukdar told TechCrunch. “Existing companies were deeply antagonistic toward artists, creators, and the broader industry.”
To Talukdar’s point, most generative AI companies train models on public data, some of which is invariably copyrighted. These companies argue that fair-use doctrine shields the practice. For instance, OpenAI has insisted that it can’t properly train models without copyrighted material, and Suno has argued that indiscriminate training is no different from a “kid writing their own rock songs after listening to the genre.”
But that hasn’t stopped rights owners from lodging complaints or filing cease and desists.
Vendors have become quite brazen even as lawsuits against them pile up. Early this year, ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati didn’t outright deny that OpenAI’s video model, Sora, was trained on YouTube clips — in seeming violation of YouTube’s usage policy. Elsewhere, a 404 Media report suggests Runway, a generative video startup, scraped YouTube footage from channels belonging to Disney and creators like MKBHD without permission.
Canadian AI startup Viggle outright admits that it uses YouTube videos to fuel its video models. And, like most of its rivals, it offers no recourse for creators whose works might’ve been swept up in its training.
“Generative models need to respect copyrights, trademarks, and likeness rights,” Talukdar said. “That’s why we’re partnering closely with creators on our models.”
Moonvalley, which doesn’t have a fully trained video model yet, claims it’s one of the few companies using exclusively licensed data from content owners who’ve “opted in.” To cover its bases, Moonvalley intends to let creators request their content be removed from its models, allow customers to delete their data at any time, and offer an indemnity policy to protect users from copyright challenges.
It’s a bit of a pivot from Moonvalley’s original pitch, which was a rather generic video generator for creating anime- and fantasy-style clips. Moonvalley released two video generation models in beta to its over-100,000-user-strong Discord community before deciding to shift gears.
The new approach parallels Adobe’s, which is training its Firefly video models on licensed content from its Adobe Stock contributor platform. Talukdar wouldn’t say how much Moonvalley is paying creators for clips, but it could be quite a lot. Bloomberg reported that Adobe was offering around $120 for every 40-45 minutes of video.
To be clear, Moonvalley isn’t procuring content itself. It’s working with unnamed partners who handle the licensing arrangements and package videos into datasets that Moonvalley purchases.
These partners — so-called “data brokers” — are in high demand these days, thanks to the generative AI boom. The market for AI training data is expected to grow from roughly $2.5 billion now to nearly $30 billion within a decade.
“We’re licensing high-quality data from multiple sources that work directly with creators and compensate them well for the use of their content,” Talukdar added. “We’re ensuring that we’re using a high-quality, diverse dataset.”
Unlike some “unfiltered” video models that readily insert a person’s likeness into clips, Moonvalley is also committing to building guardrails around its creative tooling. Like OpenAI’s Sora, Moonvalley’s models will block certain content, like NSFW phrases, and won’t allow people to prompt them to generate videos of specific people or celebrities.
Of course, no filter’s perfect, but Talukdar says that this “red-teaming” will be a core part of Moonvalley’s release strategy.
“As the relationship between media and AI continues to evolve rapidly, and not without skepticism, Moonvalley aims to establish itself as the most trusted partner for media organizations,” he said.
But can Moonvalley really compete?
As alluded to earlier, Google, Meta, and countless others are pursuing generative video — with varying degrees of ethical consideration. Tech giants are changing their terms of use to gain a data advantage: Google is training its Veo video model on YouTube videos, while Meta is training its models on Instagram and Facebook content.
Moonvalley hopes to appeal to brands and creative houses, but some vendors have already made meaningful headway there. Runway recently signed a deal with Lionsgate to train a custom model on the studio’s movie catalog; Stability AI recruited “Avatar” director James Cameron to its board of directors; and OpenAI teamed up with brands and independent directors to showcase Sora’s potential.
Then there’s Adobe, which is going after Moonvalley’s target market: Artists and content creators who want “safer” (from a legal perspective, at least) generative video tools.
Moonvalley’s challenge is three-fold. It’ll have to convince customers its tools are competitive with what’s already out there. It’ll need to build up enough runway to be able to train and serve follow-up models. And it’ll have to secure a loyal base of customers who won’t switch to another provider at a moment’s notice.
Many artists and creators are understandably wary of generative AI, since it threatens to upend the film and television industry. A 2024 study commissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimates that more than 100,000 U.S.-based film, television, and animation jobs will be disrupted by AI by 2026.
“Our focus is on building tools to help creators create ever grander and more immersive content,” Talukdar said when I asked him about the risk of creatives losing their jobs from generative AI.
On the runway front, Moonvalley’s made some progress: The company recently raised $70 million in a seed funding round co-led by General Catalyst and Khosla Ventures, with participation from Bessemer Ventures. That’ll fund Moonvalley’s R&D and hiring.
Currently, the company has about 30 employees who previously worked at DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and TikTok, Talukdar says.
“What differentiates us from other companies is a product focus,” he added. “While the core of our company is in training state-of-the-art generative models, our focus is on building deeply capable creative tools to turn these models into powerhouse equipment for professional creators, studios, and brands.”
Talukdar says the plan is to release Moonvalley’s first model later this year. The company will have to hurry if it hopes to beat upcoming releases from Black Forest Labs, Luma Labs, Midjourney, and the elephant in the room.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/xiaomi-taps-phonepe-indus-appstore-for-india-smartphones/,Xiaomi taps PhonePe's app store for India smartphones | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-11-18,"Xiaomi will replace its app store with fintech PhonePe’s offering for customers in India starting in January. The move is a major win for the Indian startup, as well as a sign of further recalibration for the Chinese hardware giant in one of its biggest markets outside its home country.
Xiaomi, the second largest smartphone vendor in India after Vivo, will automatically push the update to customers’ devices in India to replace GetApps with PhonePe’s Indus AppStore, it informed customers over the weekend.
“The GetApps team will continue providing app installation and support services under the name Indus Services App,” stated a customer notice seen by TechCrunch.
Xiaomi has shipped more than 250 million smartphones and another 100 million other devices in India since beginning operations in the country in 2013. But after a strong start in India, Xiaomi has also faced some struggles. On the heels of a scandal related to illegal remittances, the company wound down its financial services business in 2022. And amid tensions between India and China, its market share has declined and its executive bench has seen a lot of changes.
PhonePe — backed by investors including Walmart, General Atlantic, and Tiger Global — launched the Indus AppStore in February this year, seeking to challenge Google’s monopoly in India, which is the Android giant’s largest market by users. (Vivo also offers users both its own V-Appstore and Google Play, the official Android store.)
A number of businesses in India, as is the case in many parts of the world, have voiced concerns about Google’s “excessive” fees of up to 30% on app transactions in recent years and complained that the Android maker doesn’t permit use of third-party in-app payments on the Play Store.
PhonePe’s Indus AppStore seeks to address some of these concerns with its first-year no listing fee, support for third-party payments providers, local languages, and customer support.
Xiaomi and PhonePe didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/text-marketing-firm-blip-secures-backing-from-softbank-and-microsoft/,"Text marketing firm Blip secures backing from SoftBank, Microsoft | TechCrunch",Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-18,"People prefer texts over phone calls — especially when it’s a company on the other side. According to one survey, two-thirds of consumers say they’d switch to a company that offered texting as a contact option.
With the text-message marketing industry expected to grow to $12.6 billion by 2025, it’s not surprising that vendors like Blip (formerly Take Blip), which help organizations manage their text messaging campaigns, are riding high. Blip says over the past few years, its customer base has grown to more than 4,000 brands, including GM, Dell, and Claro.
Founded around 25 years ago by Roberto Oliveira, Daniel Costa, Sérgio Passos, Marcelo Oliveira, and Antônio Oliveira, Blip today connects brands and customers across apps and platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, RCS, and iMessage.
Of course, the business looked a lot different when it started off in 1999. Smartphones as we know them didn’t exist, and apps like WhatsApp and Instagram hadn’t even been conceived of.
The company started as a cellphone store, then got into ringtones. Then at the start of the chatbot craze in 2014, it pivoted again to conversational marketing.
“There’s no doubt that the interface for digital experiences was shifting towards conversational formats,” Oliveira said in a statement. “We’ve shown brands that social and conversational networks are much more than just communication channels; they are operational systems capable of engaging, selling, and delivering customer support with remarkable results.”
In its latest incarnation, Blip helps companies set up AI-powered chatbots to answer questions and transfer customers to human reps for more complicated requests. Built-in tools let brands create conversation flows, track sentiment, and add things like payments support for conversational commerce.
“Using Blip’s platform, brands can implement a feedback loop that ensures each new interaction with customers will get better in the future,” Oliveira said. “Our aim is to assist our customers in identifying areas for improvement in their conversational applications, ultimately enhancing user experiences.”
Blip also provides detailed analytics to monitor customer reps’ performance — a feature some reps might have an issue with. One poll found that the pressure of answering customer requests weighs on the mental well-being of more than four in five service reps, with three-quarters reporting that having daily or weekly ticket targets increases their stress levels.
Oliveira emphasized that the monitoring features are optional and can be customized depending on a brand’s needs.
Take Blip competes with Glia, Bird, Gupshup, Voxie, Emotive, and others in the crowded text-based marketing sector. Connectly, backed by Alibaba, is another rival, as is Postscript, which focuses on e-commerce.
Still, Blip has grown steadily, notching annual revenue of more than $100 million in 2022. The company says its customers have created more than 300,000 chatbots using its tools, and it facilitates over 50 million conversations a day through social messaging apps.
Blip, which was bootstrapped until early 2020, this month closed a $60 million Series C funding round led by SoftBank, with participation from Microsoft — a rare direct investment. The new cash brings the company’s total capital raised to $230 million, and will be put toward international expansion and product development.
“In 2022, we made a dual commitment to our board of directors and shareholders: to maintain our path of sustainable growth while also aiming for positive cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2023,” Oliveira said. “All our achievements and decisions have allowed us to enhance the company’s efficiency and productivity, enabling us to grow profitably — one of our top priorities. In 2023, we resumed generating cash, and we are now in a more comfortable position: we are growing and generating cash flow.”
Mergers and acquisitions might be in the works, too. In 2022, Blip purchased Stilingue, a platform that uses AI to monitor texts across marketing channels. And in 2023, it bought Gus, a Mexican firm in the conversational AI space.
Blip has more than 1,500 employees and offices in Brazil, Mexico, and Spain. It’s headquartered in São Paulo.
Latin American companies are becoming increasingly attractive to venture investors, thanks to a growing talent pool and demand for middle-class-friendly services. According to the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America, the Latin American venture capital market reached its second-highest level on record in 2023, continuing a three-year trend."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/roblox-no-longer-allows-users-under-13-to-message-others-outside-of-games/,Roblox no longer allows users under 13 to message others outside of games | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-11-18,"Roblox will not let users under the age of 13 message others outside of games and experiences on the platform, the company said Friday. Roblox also announced a series of other built-in protections for young users, such as age-gating certain experiences, along with enhanced parental controls.
Roblox has been criticized for failing to protect children and young users from online predators, so these new features seem to be an attempt at regaining trust. A recent Bloomberg investigation exposed how predators are able to find and groom children on Roblox.
Shortly after the Bloomberg report was released, Roblox said it would introduce changes to keep children on its platform safe. Now, it’s officially rolling out protections and giving parents more insight and control into their child’s usage of the platform.
During a press briefing, the company explained that users under the age of 13 will still be able to access in-game chats because Roblox believes that communication is fundamental to gameplay on the platform. Parents can change this setting if they wish.
In addition, Roblox is age-gating certain experiences for users under 13. The new restrictions apply to games and experiences that are designed for socializing with people outside of a person’s friends list, such as experiences that allow free-form writing or drawing.
“The reason that we’ve made this decision is that we’ve seen that some of both the content and the conduct in these experiences is more appropriate for older users and teens,” said Dina Lamdany, Roblox’s product lead for user settings and parental controls, during the press briefing.
Although Roblox already offers some parental controls, it previously only allowed them to be managed from a child’s account. Now, the company is introducing remote management, which allows parents to adjust controls and see their child’s activity from their own devices. To do so, parents can link their Roblox account to their child’s account after verifying themselves using an ID or credit card.
Parents can now also see their child’s average weekly screen time and set daily time limits. They can also see their child’s Friends list.
Up until now, Roblox has labeled experiences by age to display content maturity levels. Now, Roblox is launching simplified descriptions of the types of content available on the platform. If an experience is labeled “minimal,” that means it “may contain occasional mild violence, light unrealistic blood, and/or occasional mild fear.” A “mild” label means that an experience “may contain repeated mild violence, heavy unrealistic blood, mild crude humor, and/or repeated mild fear.”
An experience labeled “moderate” may contain “moderate violence, light realistic blood, moderate crude humor, unplayable gambling content, and/or moderate fear.” A “restricted” experience “may contain strong violence, heavy realistic blood, moderate crude humor, romantic themes, unplayable gambling content, the presence of alcohol, strong language, and/or moderate fear.”
Users under the age of nine can only access “minimal” or “mild” content by default, and can only access “moderate content” with parental consent. Parents can select the level that they feel is best for their child.
Built-in protections on Roblox will now also be automatically removed once a child grows out of them and moves into another age group. Roblox will notify parents 30 days before their child’s age-based settings change.
“We really aim to be safe by default for users of all ages, and our policies and features will continue to adapt in service of that goal,” Lamdany said. “We think that doing so is the right thing for kids, for parents, creators, investors, and the company overall.”
The changes announced Friday will roll out to all users this week.
This story was updated to clarify that users under 13 cannot directly message others on the platform, regardless of parental permission."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/juna-ai-wants-to-use-ai-agents-to-make-factories-more-energy-efficient/,Juna.ai wants to use AI agents to make factories more energy-efficient | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-11-18,"AI agents are all the rage, a trend driven by the generative AI and large language model (LLM) boom these past few years. Getting people to agree on what exactly AI agents are is a challenge, but most contend they are software programs that can be assigned tasks and given decisions to make — with varying degrees of autonomy.
In short, AI agents go beyond what a mere chatbot can do: They help people get things done.
It’s still early days, but the likes of Salesforce and Google are already investing heavily in AI agents. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently hinted at a more “agentic” Alexa in the future, one that’s as much about action as it is words.
In tandem, startups are also raising cash off the hype. The latest of these is German company Juna.ai, which wants to help factories be more efficient by automating complex industrial processes to “maximize production throughput, increase energy efficiency and reduce overall emissions.”
And to pull that off, the Berlin-based startup today said that it has raised $7.5 million in a seed round from Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, Sweden-based Norrsken VC, and Kleiner Perkins’ chairman John Doerr.
Founded in 2023, Juna.ai is the handiwork of Matthias Auf der Mauer (pictured above, left) and Christian Hardenberg (pictured above, right). Der Mauer previously founded a predictive machine maintenance startup called AiSight and sold it to Swiss smart sensor company Sensirion in 2021, while Hardenberg is the former chief technology officer at European food delivery giant Delivery Hero.
At its core, Juna.ai wants to help manufacturing facilities transform into smarter, self-learning systems that can deliver better margins and, ultimately, a lower carbon footprint. The company focuses on “heavy industries” — industries such as steel, cement, paper, chemicals, wood and textile with large-scale production processes that consume lots of raw materials.
“We work with very process-driven industries, and it mostly involves use cases that use a lot of energy,” der Mauer told TechCrunch. “So, for example, chemical reactors that use a lot of heat in order to produce something.”
Juna.ai’s software integrates with manufacturers’ production tools, like industrial software from Aveva or SAP, and looks at all its historical data garnered from machine sensors. This might involve temperate, pressure, velocity, and all the measurements of the given output, such as quality, thickness, and color.
Using this information, Juna.ai helps companies train their in-house agents to figure out the optimal settings for machinery, giving operators real-time data and guidance to ensure everything is running at peak efficiency with minimal waste.
For example, a chemical plant that produces a special kind of carbon might use a reactor to mix different oils together and put it through an energy-intensive combustion process. To maximize the output and minimize residual waste, conditions need to be optimal, including the levels of gases and oils used, and the temperature applied to the process. Using historical data to establish the ideal settings and taking real-time conditions into account, Juna.ai’s agents supposedly tell the operator what changes they should be making to achieve the best output.
If Juna.ai can help companies fine-tune their production equipment, they can improve their throughput while reducing energy consumption. It’s a win-win, both for the customer’s bottom line and its carbon footprint.
Juna.ai says it has built its own custom AI models, using open source tools such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. And to train its models, the company uses reinforcement learning, a subset of machine learning (ML) that involves a model learning through its interactions with its environment — it tries different actions, observes what happens, and improves.
“The interesting thing about reinforcement learning is that it’s something that can take actions,” Hardenberg told TechCrunch. “Typical models only do predictions, or maybe generate something. But they can’t control.”
Much of what Juna.ai is doing at present is more akin to a “copilot” — it serves up a screen that tells the operator what tweaks they should be making to the controls. However, many industrial processes are incredibly repetitive, which is why enabling a system to take actual actions is helpful. A cooling system, for instance, might require constant fine-tuning to ensure a machine maintains the right temperature.
Factories are already well accustomed to automating system controls using PID and MPC controllers, so this is something that Juna.ai could feasibly do, too. Still, for a fledgling AI startup, it’s easier to sell a copilot — it’s baby steps for now.
“It’s technically possible for us to let it run autonomously right now; we would just need to implement the connection. But in the end, it’s really all about building trust with the customer,” der Mauer said.
Hardenberg added that the benefit of the startup’s platform doesn’t lie in saving labor, noting that factories are already “quite efficient” in terms of automating manual processes. It’s all about optimizing those processes to cut costly waste.
“There’s not a lot to gain by removing one person, compared to a process that costs you $20 million in energy,” he said. “So the real gain is, can we go from $20 million in energy to $18 million or $17 million?”
For now, Juna.ai’s big promise is an AI agent tailored to each customer using their historical data. But in the future, the company plans to offer off-the-shelf “pretrained” agents that don’t need much in the way of training on a new customer’s data.
“If we build simulations again and again, we get to a place where we can potentially have simulation templates that can be reused,” der Mauer said.
So if two companies use the same kind of chemical reactor, for instance, it might be possible to lift-and-shift AI agents between customers. One model for one machine, is the general gist.
However, there’s no ignoring the fact that enterprises have been hesitant to dive headfirst into the burgeoning AI revolution due to data privacy concerns. These concerns aren’t lost on Juna.ai, but Hardenberg said that it hasn’t been a major issue so far, partly due to its data residency controls, and partly due to the promise it gives customers in terms of unlocking latent value from vast banks of data.
“I was seeing that as a potential problem, but so far, it hasn’t been such a big problem because we leave all data in Germany for our German customers,” Hardenberg said. “They get their own server set up, and we have top-notch security guarantees. From their side, they have all this data lying around, but they haven’t been so effective at creating value from it; it was mostly used for alerting, or maybe some manual analytics. But our view is that we can do much more with this data — build an intelligent factory, and become the brain of that factory based on the data they have.”
A little more than a year since its foundation, Juna.ai has a handful of customers already, though der Mauer said he’s not at liberty to reveal any specific names yet. They are all based in Germany, though, and they all either have subsidiaries elsewhere or are subsidiaries of companies based elsewhere.
“We’re planning to grow with them — it’s a very good way to expand with your customers,” Hardenberg added.
With the fresh $7.5 million in the bank, Juna.ai is now well-financed to expand beyond its current headcount of six, with plans to double down on its technical expertise.
“It’s a software company at the end of the day, and that basically means people,” Hardenberg said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/india-healthkart-raises-153-million-in-new-funding/,India's HealthKart valued at $500M in new investment | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-11-18,"Indian nutrition startup HealthKart’s valuation has surged to about $500 million in a new all-secondary investment of $153 million, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.
The investment, one of the largest for an Indian consumer startup this year, was co-led by private equity firms ChrysCapital and Motilal Oswal, with Avendus Capital serving as financial adviser. A91 Partners and asset manager Neo Group also participated in the round. The startup was previously valued at $350 million.
Some of the startup’s older investors sold their shares to the new backers, the sources said. Peak XV, formerly known as Sequoia India and Southeast Asia, has fully exited the startup, selling shares it bought for less than $30 million for about $120 million. HealthKart also counts Temasek, Sofina, and wealth manager IIFL among its backers.
Gurugram-based HealthKart reported revenue of $118.5 million for the year ended March 2024, cementing its position as India’s largest consumer nutrition platform. The startup sells protein supplements and health accessories.
The 13-year-old startup, which spun out of online pharmacy startup 1mg, said on Thursday that it is buying back shares worth $6.5 million from employees. The startup was EBITDA profitable in the financial year ended March.
“The Indian sports nutrition market, currently underpenetrated, is expected to expand due to a rise in fitness awareness and the increasing importance of nutrition and protein,” said Arpit Vinayak, VP at ChrysCapital, in a statement."

The investment, through Redsprig Innovation Partners, would value the SoftBank-backed company at $3.8 billion, according to terms shared in a notice to shareholders.
While this represents a 38% premium to Oyo’s recent $2.3 billion valuation in June, the implied price tag remains significantly below the startup’s 2019 peak of $10 billion. Oyo has raised more than $3.4 billion in equity and debt since its inception, according to Tracxn.
Redsprig invested about $100 million in the June funding round, in which Oyo raised $175 million.
It remains unclear who else is backing Redsprig and whether Agarwal has settled the $2 billion loan he took in 2019 to repurchase Oyo shares from Peak XV and Lightspeed India.
The hospitality group is preparing to file — for the third time — for an initial public offering within two months, according to a person familiar with the matter."

For one thing, while multiplayer games and early social networks such as MySpace already existed, WoW provided a real preview of a future where everyone would connect to friends and strangers online. For another, the game made billions of dollars with a business model combining monthly subscriptions with in-game purchases (including for pets and animals that players could ride), becoming a massive cash cow for Blizzard and pointing the way to future internet business models.
The game also spawned immortal memes, attracted celebrity fans, and prompted epidemiologists to argue that an incident involving the uncontrolled spread of a fantasy disease could be studied for insights into real-world epidemics.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/17/what-is-bluesky-when-its-not-the-underdog/,What is Bluesky when it’s not the underdog? | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-11-17,"Bluesky is having a moment — a moment that’s already stretched on for nearly three months.
Over the summer, the social media app saw a wave of new sign-ups in Brazil after X (formerly Twitter) was temporarily banned there. And in the United States, unhappiness with changes at X, and with owner Elon Musk’s close relationship with President-Elect Donald Trump, seem to have dramatically accelerated Bluesky’s growth.
According to SimilarWeb, X’s traffic and account deactivations both peaked the day after the presidential election. Bluesky, meanwhile, says it’s started adding a million new users every day; on Saturday, the company announced that it now has 18 million total users, and it’s currently the No. 1 free app on Apple’s App Store.
This has, unsurprisingly, caused some problems, with periods of slowness or downtime, as well as challenges for content moderation and safety. In an interview with The New York Times, CEO Jay Graber acknowledged that there are “always some growing pains,” but she said her 20-person full-time team takes “pride in our ability to scale quickly.”
Alongside the technical issues, longtime users seem to be wrestling with what this rapid growth means for the Bluesky community. Yes, there have been triumphant posts about App Store rankings and the latest celebrity sign-ups, but also self-deprecating discourse about the qualifications for being “Bluesky elder,” hand-wringing when the wrong kinds of users show up, and pleading/scolding reminders to “don’t engage, just block” when dealing with trolls.
I’ve even noticed that my own weird relationship with Bluesky is changing. While I’ve spent more time there than on any other social media app in the past year, my follower count stalled at around 200 — a fact that I found freeing, though not freeing enough for me to post more than once a month or so. This week, the numbers started to go up again, and even though they’re still pretty low (I used to be big on other social networks, I swear), I immediately started to worry that someone might actually notice if I said something stupid.
Despite my own Bluesky presence being negligible, I do feel protective about it. I suppose it’s a familiar story: Early fans are always complaining when something new and cool gets discovered by the mainstream. And no, I’m not about to start posting “Keep Bluesky weird!” or declaring, “Bluesky is over!” But I worry that what’s been fun and weird and even life-affirming about the Bluesky community could dissipate or disappear with the influx of new users.
Put another way: Bluesky has always felt like the small, left-y alternative to X. So what makes Bluesky Bluesky when it’s no longer the “short king” of social media? Seeing so many familiar names from Old Twitter, I wondered if we’re just going to re-create Twitter circa 2014. Which wouldn’t be the worst thing, but in 2024, can’t we do better?
At least Bluesky’s executives have signaled that they want to do things differently. Some of the distinctions, like the focus on decentralization, may be largely invisible to regular users, but many of their priorities seem baked into the product and the business. There are the aggressive blocking features, the reverse chronological (not algorithmic) feed, the pledge to not train AI on users’ posts, and a future business model focused on paid subscriptions rather than advertising.
Graber is aware of a potential culture clash, describing it as an “eternal September” problem, where old-timers become unhappy when waves of newbies show up and inevitably change things. She said Bluesky is looking to address this by adding more features to allow users to customize their experience, and by improving its automated content moderation tools.
Maybe the coming months and years will demonstrate that those decisions and features can actually protect and nourish healthy online communities. And maybe we’ve all learned something from seeing how other social networks wither with toxicity or sterility. I hope so. And if not? Well, one thing I‘ve learned from Twitter is that you should always be ready to move on to the next app."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/17/the-exploration-company-raises-160m-to-build-europes-answer-to-spacex-dragon/,The Exploration Company raises $160M to build Europe’s answer to SpaceX Dragon  | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-11-17,"Only two companies currently provide cargo delivery to and from the International Space Station, and both are based in the United States. The Exploration Company, which operates out of Germany, France, and Italy, is looking to change that: It just closed a large funding round to further its mission of building Europe’s first reusable space capsule.
The $160 million Series B round will fund the continued development of the Nyx spacecraft, which will be capable of carrying 3,000 kilograms of cargo to and from Earth. The company, which was founded by aerospace engineer Hélène Huby in 2021, is aiming to conduct Nyx’s maiden flight to and from the ISS in 2028.
“We are the first company in the world where this is for the first time mainly funded by private investors,” Huby said in a recent interview. This is in contrast to SpaceX’s Dragon capsule, which she said was “mainly funded by NASA.”
The new funding, which was led by Balderton Capital and Plural, brings the startup’s total funding to date to over $208 million. The Series B also included participation from Bessemer Venture Partners, NGP Capital, and two sovereign European funds, French Tech Souveraineté and DeepTech & Climate Fonds.
“We’ve been able to deliver on promises in the past three years,” Huby said. “We’ve been able to meet our cash target every quarter. … The investors, they could see that we basically can deliver on time, on cost, on quality.”
The startup has made traction with the European Space Agency (ESA), which has recognized the need to foster native space launch and transportation capabilities. The Exploration Company was awarded a study contract worth around €25 million ($27 million) to develop cargo return services earlier this year. That contract will run through 2026, with additional competitive contract opportunities expected to follow. ESA’s aim is to have at least one capsule launching to the ISS in 2028.
The structure of the contract, called the LEO Cargo Return Service Contract, resembles NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program that the agency launched in 2006. That program resulted in multibillion-dollar transportation contracts to SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corporation (now Northrop Grumman).
It’s a promising start, but equally promising is the traction The Exploration Company is seeing on the commercial side. Around 90% of the startup’s $770 million contract backlog has come from private station developers Vast, Axiom Space, and Starlab, according to recent reporting.
The Exploration Company’s first demonstrator vehicle launched on the maiden flight of Ariane 6 this summer, though it was not deployed due to an issue with the rocket’s upper stage. The second subscale demonstrator mission, called Mission Possible, is scheduled to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 next year.
“I highly respect what SpaceX has been able to achieve,” Huby said. “We are trying to learn as much as possible from that, we are inspired by what they have achieved. But we also believe the world needs more competition and we want, step by step, to build an alternative. We are very aware that we are late, that we are much smaller, et cetera, but we need to start.”
The story has been updated to reflect that Huby is the sole founder."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/17/norwegian-startup-factiverse-wants-to-fight-disinformation-with-ai/,Norwegian startup Factiverse wants to fight disinformation with AI | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-11-17,"In the wake of the U.S. 2024 presidential election, one fact became clear: Disinformation proliferated online at a startling rate, shaping Americans’ views about each candidate as well as a diverse set of topics, including public health, climate change, and immigration. Generative AI — with its ability to produce deepfakes in seconds and its propensity to hallucinate facts — only stands to exacerbate the problem.
Factiverse, a startup that participated in TechCrunch Disrupt’s Startup Battlefield 200 in October, is bracing itself for the onslaught. The company, which won best pitch in the Security, Privacy, and Social Networking category, has developed a business-to-business tool that provides live fact-checking of text, video, and audio. The company’s pitch: to help businesses save hours of research and mitigate any reputational risk or legal liability.
The Norwegian startup is still in its early stages; Factiverse has raised around $1.45 million in pre-seed money since launching in 2020. Yet it has already begun working with both media and financial partners, including one of the largest banks in Norway, according to Factiverse CEO and co-founder Maria Amelie.
Factiverse even provided live fact-checking of the U.S. presidential debates that was used by several media partners, Amelie said.
“We’re not an LLM (large language model). We’ve built a different type of model based on information retrieval,” Amelie told TechCrunch.
As a former technology journalist and published author, Amelie has firsthand experience in the war against facts. She worked with Factiverse co-founder and CTO Vinay Setty, who is associate professor in machine learning at the University of Stavanger, to launch the startup with a B2B focus.
Factiverse’s model is trained on high-quality, well-curated, and credible data from reliable sources and fact-checkers around the world, according to Amelie, and not the “junk food data” that generative AI is trained on.
“We train our AI model to intuitively think like someone who has a lot of experience with researching information,” Amelie said.
The model, which is based on machine learning and natural language processing, is able to identify claims and search the web in real time — everything from search engines like Google and Bing to AI search engines like You.com to academic papers.
“The most fun part is that we’re not showing you whatever comes up first on those search engines,” Amelie said. “We’re actually proposing to you what sources are the most, or historically have been the most, credible on your topic. … We actually look into the domain in correlation to the topic, and sometimes even who is being quoted in an article.”
As of today, Factiverse says it outperforms GPT-4, Mistral 7B, and GPT-3 in its ability to identify fact check-worthy claims in 114 languages. The company’s model also outperforms LLMs on determining the veracity of a claim. Amelie said Factiverse’s success rate is around 80% and the goal is to improve as the company onboards new customers around the world.
“We have enough funding to be the best, but we are here in the U.S. to become the fastest,” Amelie told TechCrunch. She also noted the company wants to raise a seed round in 2025. “We are looking for customers and investors who want to invest in trust and credibility,” she said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/17/2916508/,Precursor's Charles Hudson believes founders should test their investors | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-11-17,"Charles Hudson, managing partner of Precursor Ventures, told an audience at AfroTech the basics of knowing when to invest: A company should have product-market fit and some form of traction.
But the next thing he said garnered some surprised looks from the audience: Founders should test investors with a small issue to see how they react to problems. ”I’m on a board with someone who tends to blow up every time the founder brings them a problem,” he said. “As you can imagine, the founder has basically stopped bringing problems to them.”
And that, in itself, can be a problem — both in investing and in life. When someone feels they can’t trust you with little problems, odds are they will not trust you with big problems, either. Hudson said these little tests can help weed out the constructive problem-solvers and help to establish trust early on. “There are people you would tell your deepest, darkest secrets, and there are people that you would bring ordinary problems to.”
Hudson has a lot of experience in establishing trust with founders. His firm has invested in more than 400 companies, including the social networking apps why?! and Diem, as well as the diaper company Kudos. The firm has $250 million in assets under management, sitting on around $89 million in dry powder, according to PitchBook.
He shared with the high-level executives in the audience what he looks for in a pitch deck (a balance of storytelling and data); a good team (to see whether the founder has good hiring judgment); and even founders’ previous startup experience. But what really stuck out was how he spoke about the importance of vulnerability and the skills needed to build trust, including how to have a conversation and how to convey emotional intelligence.
It’s quite rare to hear an investor be so open about the importance of being so open. “Not every investor that passes or gives you feedback is going to say the truth,” he said. The moderator then asked if investors should tell the truth more, to which Hudson responded, “This whole ecosystem would work better if people just told the truth.”
He and his team try to give a founder as much feedback as they want to hear. But they often aim to go deeper than that.
“I think it’s a beautiful thing when an investor and a founder can get to a place where they trust each other to be honest and open,” he said. “Vulnerability can go both ways.”
He said he’s met a lot of investors who think they deserve a founder’s trust. But that’s something that should be earned, he said. “You wouldn’t approach any other relationship in your life, expecting a stranger to tell you their deepest darkest secrets and trust you with them.”
He said he always tells founders that his goal is to get to a place where they can trust each other. That way, hard feedback can be taken as if it is coming from a place of care.
For similar reasons, Hudson said he puts a lot of weight on emotional intelligence, “because I do think it underpins a lot of the challenges you’ll have as a startup,” he continued.
Founders need to learn how to hire, evaluate, and influence people, a company, partners, and investors. There is a relationship between emotional intelligence and emotional well-being, he said. “One of the things I’m always testing for is, ‘Do I think this person is going to be able to manage the emotional ups and downs of startup life?’” he said. This is why he always looks for other challenging tasks a founder has taken on as a clue to see how they handle stress.
“That could be a hobby, that could be travel, that could be a startup, that could be a nonprofit,” he said. “I just want to see some evidence that a person has worked on something difficult and stuck with it. Because startups are a big bundle of challenges.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/17/robust-ais-carter-pro-robot-is-designed-to-work-with-and-be-moved-by-humans/,"Robust AI’s Carter Pro robot is designed to work with, and be moved by, humans | TechCrunch",Brian Heater,2024-11-17,"Two things are immediately notable when watching the Carter Pro robot navigate the aisles of the demo warehouse inside Robust AI’s San Carlos, California, headquarters. The first is the shelving units: standardized, modular, and off-the-shelf. The wire frames will look familiar to anyone who has spent time in warehouses, and that’s certainly by design.
The second thing isn’t a visible element of the wheeled robot itself, but instead how humans in the space interact with their automated co-worker. As Carter cruises the halls, Robust employees pick it up and move it around. It sounds like a small distinction, but it’s notable in this world where humans and robots work side by side.
The question of safety hasn’t been raised with enough regularity in stories covering the rise of humanoid robots in the work setting. While some companies have moved beyond the days of industrial arms tucked away in safety cages, there’s always a risk when humans are working alongside an autonomously moving metal system. Heck, electric forklifts have been around since the 1930s and are still regularly involved with workplace injuries.
Being able to manually move the robot could be an important part of deploying industrial robotic systems in the future. For Carter, that means more than just becoming a passive piece of equipment, but rather sensing the force being applied and adjusting accordingly. There’s also a bright orange handlebar that allows for single-handed control — a surprisingly complex challenge when creating a system like this.
That the collaborative nature is a core tenet of the system isn’t a surprise, given the founders’ pedigree. Prior to Robust, CTO Rodney Brooks founded Rethink Robotics, which also centered on human-robot interactions (HRI). While plenty of column space has been devoted to a future in which humanoid and other robots have entirely replaced their human counterparts, that’s a distant vision, at best.
People and robots are going to be working side by side for the foreseeable future, so it’s important to ensure we can do so safely.
Another Carter differentiator Brooks is quick to point out is the use of cameras, rather than lidar. It’s a move that’s growing in popularity among autonomous mobile robot (AMR) makers. Pricing is a big piece of that puzzle, but there are additional reasons lidar might not be the best solution in a warehouse setting.
A number of partners have been testing out an early version of the system, prior to the production model’s release. “It was just over a week that the first one came off the production line,” Brooks tells TechCrunch. DHL is the first large customer to be publicly announced, but while the global logistics firm no doubt has more than enough work to keep the robotics startup busy for the next decade, Brooks says that Robust is intentionally diversifying its client portfolio.
“We’re not going to just do business with DHL,” he explains. “Walmart had a whole bunch of robotics companies, and then they shut it down, and now those robotics companies are in trouble. We’ve made it clear to DHL that they only get a certain percentage of the robots we build, because we have to have a broader customer base.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/17/a-popular-technique-to-make-ai-more-efficient-has-drawbacks/,A popular technique to make AI more efficient has drawbacks | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-17,"One of the most widely used techniques to make AI models more efficient, quantization, has limits — and the industry could be fast approaching them.
In the context of AI, quantization refers to lowering the number of bits — the smallest units a computer can process — needed to represent information. Consider this analogy: When someone asks the time, you’d probably say “noon” — not “oh twelve hundred, one second, and four milliseconds.” That’s quantizing; both answers are correct, but one is slightly more precise. How much precision you actually need depends on the context.
AI models consist of several components that can be quantized — in particular parameters, the internal variables models use to make predictions or decisions. This is convenient, considering models perform millions of calculations when run. Quantized models with fewer bits representing their parameters are less demanding mathematically, and therefore computationally. (To be clear, this is a different process from “distilling,” which is a more involved and selective pruning of parameters.)
But quantization may have more trade-offs than previously assumed.
According to a study from researchers at Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Databricks, and Carnegie Mellon, quantized models perform worse if the original, unquantized version of the model was trained over a long period on lots of data. In other words, at a certain point, it may actually be better to just train a smaller model rather than cook down a big one.
That could spell bad news for AI companies training extremely large models (known to improve answer quality) and then quantizing them in an effort to make them less expensive to serve.
The effects are already manifesting. A few months ago, developers and academics reported that quantizing Meta’s Llama 3 model tended to be “more harmful” compared to other models, potentially due to the way it was trained.
“In my opinion, the number one cost for everyone in AI is and will continue to be inference, and our work shows one important way to reduce it will not work forever,” Tanishq Kumar, a Harvard mathematics student and the first author on the paper, told TechCrunch.
Contrary to popular belief, AI model inferencing — running a model, like when ChatGPT answers a question — is often more expensive in aggregate than model training. Consider, for example, that Google spent an estimated $191 million to train one of its flagship Gemini models — certainly a princely sum. But if the company were to use a model to generate just 50-word answers to half of all Google Search queries, it’d spend roughly $6 billion a year.
Major AI labs have embraced training models on massive datasets under the assumption that “scaling up” — increasing the amount of data and compute used in training — will lead to increasingly more capable AI.
For example, Meta trained Llama 3 on a set of 15 trillion tokens. (Tokens represent bits of raw data; 1 million tokens is equal to about 750,000 words.) The previous generation, Llama 2, was trained on “only” 2 trillion tokens.
Evidence suggests that scaling up eventually provides diminishing returns; Anthropic and Google reportedly recently trained enormous models that fell short of internal benchmark expectations. But there’s little sign that the industry is ready to meaningfully move away from these entrenched scaling approaches.
So, if labs are reluctant to train models on smaller datasets, is there a way models could be made less susceptible to degradation? Possibly. Kumar says that he and co-authors found that training models in “low precision” can make them more robust. Bear with us for a moment as we dive in a bit.
“Precision” here refers to the number of digits a numerical data type can represent accurately. Data types are collections of data values, usually specified by a set of possible values and allowed operations; the data type FP8, for example, uses only 8 bits to represent a floating-point number.
Most models today are trained at 16-bit or “half precision” and “post-train quantized” to 8-bit precision. Certain model components (e.g., its parameters) are converted to a lower-precision format at the cost of some accuracy. Think of it like doing the math to a few decimal places but then rounding off to the nearest 10th, often giving you the best of both worlds.
Hardware vendors like Nvidia are pushing for lower precision for quantized model inference. The company’s new Blackwell chip supports 4-bit precision, specifically a data type called FP4; Nvidia has pitched this as a boon for memory- and power-constrained data centers.
But extremely low quantization precision might not be desirable. According to Kumar, unless the original model is incredibly large in terms of its parameter count, precisions lower than 7- or 8-bit may see a noticeable step down in quality.
If this all seems a little technical, don’t worry — it is. But the takeaway is simply that AI models are not fully understood, and known shortcuts that work in many kinds of computation don’t work here. You wouldn’t say “noon” if someone asked when they started a 100-meter dash, right? It’s not quite so obvious as that, of course, but the idea is the same:
“The key point of our work is that there are limitations you cannot naïvely get around,” Kumar concluded. “We hope our work adds nuance to the discussion that often seeks increasingly low precision defaults for training and inference.”
Kumar acknowledges that his and his colleagues’ study was at relatively small scale — they plan to test it with more models in the future. But he believes that at least one insight will hold: There’s no free lunch when it comes to reducing inference costs.
“Bit precision matters, and it’s not free,” he said. “You cannot reduce it forever without models suffering. Models have finite capacity, so rather than trying to fit a quadrillion tokens into a small model, in my opinion much more effort will be put into meticulous data curation and filtering, so that only the highest quality data is put into smaller models. I am optimistic that new architectures that deliberately aim to make low precision training stable will be important in the future.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/17/the-best-tech-for-plant-lovers/,The best tech for plant lovers | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-17,"House plants are great. They can also be hard. All of those stress-reducing self-care qualities they promise tend to fade into the background when they suddenly turn brown for seemingly no reason.
Unlike pets and human children, they can’t bug you when something is wrong. They just sort of wither. There’s a reason Reddit is full of threads from confused plant owners who can’t figure out where things went wrong.
While plants can’t advocate for themselves, a number of smart home devices have sprung up in recent years that are aimed at maintaining healthy plants. Here are some high-tech — and low-tech — solutions that will keep plant owners and their plants happy for the coming year.
Here’s a really ambitious gift, with a price to match. Off the bat, I’m going to warn folks in older homes that between the water pump and the lights, the Farmstand Nook can be a bit of a power hog. In fact, I blew a couple of fuses running the system.
If your home can support it, however, it’s a great way to make your produce as locally sourced as possible: by growing it in your kitchen. Lettuce Grow offers a wide range of leafy greens and herbs that ship in seedling form. There’s something extremely satisfying about growing them hydroponically at home.
Click & Grow is another great solution for indoor gardening. The startup offers a wide selection of products, ranging from a compact smart garden to your very own three-tier vertical farm.
The Click & Grow 25 is built around a five-week growth and harvest cycle. It ships with 18 green lettuce, 18 romaine, and 18 red kale plant pods to start.
I love me a good, practical 3D printing application. U.K.-based M3D is using the technology to create some clever planters, including this one with a built-in, removable moss pole. My monstera albo is currently clinging to the sphagnum moss I’ve stuffed inside.
The pole is removable, so you can wet it without overwatering or increase its height by screwing on additional attachments. The 3D-printed pot, meanwhile, has a drainage grid to help avoid the death sentence that is root rot.
Naked Root is a small but great company that produces clever “breathing” planters. Available in a variety of sizes, the pots feature two layers. There’s the removable inner pot with aeration slits, which holds the plant. That sits inside a larger planter that servers as the reservoir for water runoff.
The combination helps avoid root rot from overwatering, while protecting the plant from becoming root bound by exposing larger roots to oxygen. Naked Root notes, “This process encourages the growth of billions of tiny root hairs, maximizing the absorption of water, nutrients, and oxygen.”
Sometimes old technology is the best technology. The use of ollas dates back more than 4,000 years, stretching across a wide range of global cultures. There’s some debate as to whether these controlled watering ceramics originated in China or North Africa. Wherever they come from, they’re still in use several millennia later.
The technology is that perfect combination of genius and simplicity. The small pots, which are made of unglazed terra-cotta/clay, are buried in soil and filled with water. The material is porous enough to let liquid pass through, but only when the soil surrounding it is dry. I’ve been using these in my elevated garden bed and smaller versions to keep my thirstier plants hydrated when I travel.
A lot of companies make versions of the pots. Here’s a set I recently picked up online.
Plant collections multiply fast. One day you wake up and you’ve got a couple dozen, each with its own light and nutrient requirements and individual watering cycles. After trying in vain to keep track of the above via Google Sheets, I recently bit the bullet and signed up for a Planta subscription.
Getting daily reminders to water and mist plants has been a game changer. Planta takes into account various factors, including climate and light coverage when creating schedules. The app can also be used to identify plants (this is a bit more hit or miss), detect light levels, and offer suggestions when a plant isn’t doing so well.
Full disclosure: This is the one product on the list I don’t have any firsthand experience with. That’s because the product isn’t scheduled to launch until January 2025. Consider this a kind of honorable mention for a cool Kickstarter project.
Soil monitors are nothing new, of course. In fact, you can get one for quite cheap these days. SmartyPlants, on the other hand, is a soil monitor for the smartphone age. The startup promises to “make it impossible to kill your plants.” The app-connected system monitors soil moisture, light levels, temperature, humidity, and even soil nutrient levels."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/16/consumer-tech-is-bouncing-back-and-consumer-founders-like-brynn-putnam-are-bouncing-back-with-it/,"Consumer tech is bouncing back, and consumer founders like Brynn Putnam are bouncing back with it | TechCrunch",Connie Loizos,2024-11-17,"When Brynn Putnam sold her last company, Mirror, to Lululemon for $500 million at the start of the pandemic, it looked to this editor like she’d sold the smart fitness company too soon.
Instead, the timing proved brilliant. The home fitness craze crashed nearly as abruptly as it peaked during that first year of lockdowns. Meanwhile, after a year as a general manager at Lululemon, Putnam had new operating insights, a big win under her belt, and a fresh idea that she has since turned into a new company that will launch publicly in 2025.
The venture firm Lerer Hippeau has already participated in a highly competitive round for that stealthy startup — the firm led Mirror’s $3 million seed round years ago, too — and on Wednesday night in New York, I sat down with both Lerer Hippeau managing partner Ben Lerer and Putnam to talk about what she is building. We also talked about a broader rebound that’s happening at long last for consumer tech — some of it being led by founders who led the last wave of successful consumer startups.
Following are excerpts from that chat, edited lightly for length. You can also watch the full interview below.
Ben Lerer on writing that first check:
When we invested [in Mirror], Brynn had a very convincing but totally janky demo, which was basically a sort of like a two-way mirror with a computer screen behind it to show you what a mirror would look like if she was able to raise tens of millions of dollars to actually produce such a thing. Really interestingly, she had designed a contraption that was proprietary to her [own line of boutique gyms at the time] … and when we saw it, it was just clear that Brynn was not just a clever business builder who had built a good gym brand for herself but was also an inventor. Brynn won us over very, very quickly, and maybe we looked crazy for a few years, but eventually less so.
Brynn Putnam on selling Mirror just four years after founding it:
We weren’t for sale. We weren’t looking for an acquirer. We had just really launched. But we had a longtime partnership with Lululemon. I had worked with them at my gyms for about a decade, and we had been spending a lot of time with them, making content and doing interesting events with them, and it just felt like the right fit for us to be able to really take Mirror into homes across the world with speed and certainty. We really just felt like it was this opportunity we couldn’t pass on.
As for whether Lerer weighed in with advice on that sale, he said:
I did have an opinion on it. Look, venture is a funny business because of the power law and the idea that you’re supposed to take these moonshots and you’re going to have a bunch of losses but your big wins are going to change the whole world. I believe in the power law, but I also think sometimes venture loses sight of just really basic, good, sound business decision-making. And there are some general truths in business, like: sell when others are greedy, and buy when others are scared. You don’t always have to continue to go back to the casino again and again and again. In this case, when Brynn came and said, ‘Hey, I got this offer, I’m really thinking about taking it,’ I said, ‘Yeah, you should do this for you; this is amazing for us. And if you’re getting pushback from other folks [like later-stage investors with a different cost basis], I’m happy to try to be helpful, but you’re frankly much more forceful and powerful than I am and you’ll take care of this.’ For a year or two after, I think Brynn probably got some people who second-guessed it, and now I think people see the arc of the entire category and realize it was just a totally brilliant move.
Putnam on working afterward as an exec at Lululemon, which later threw in the towel on Mirror:
An investor who I admire … told me at the time that I should be gracious and learn, that throughout the life of your company, you’re selling your company. You’re selling it in small pieces, or you’re selling it in bigger pieces, but you’re always selling your company. And the best thing you can do once you have made the decision to sell, is to really learn as much as you can from this business that you’ve chosen to sell to and try to tackle something with purpose in this new role. And that is what I did. And I learned an incredible amount in the year that I was there, and it was incredibly interesting. But I think ultimately, when you go from being a founder and CEO to effectively the general manager of a division, it’s a very large change, and for some people, it’s a fit. And for me, it just was not. I’m really a builder.
Putnam on what led her to develop her new startup:
When I left Lululemon, I was really just at a different stage of my life. I went from being pregnant to then having two children, and really, I just took stock of what was important to me at that point. Mirror was very much about me. It was my reflection, my performance, it was about making your own self better. At that next phase, my life was really just much more about my family and my friends and my relationships and those things that I was finding important. I was really struggling to find quality time with my loved ones the way that I had growing up — you know, we would sit around the table and have a meal, play a board game, look each other in the face. For my kids who have grown up glued to iPads or smartphones, the experience of quality time was more challenging.
So I really started to think about, how could I take what I learned at Mirror and apply those lessons to the category of play? How could I use tech to build better social relationships and connections? And that’s what I’m working on now. It’s a new consumer hardware company, but in the gaming space rather than fitness, really geared towards how we spend time together face-to-face, where technology is not the experience but really an enabler to building better relationships.
Asked if her new product is for children (or if it fits in one’s pocket, or one wears it on their face), Putnam answered:
It’s for everyone. It’s for friends and families spending time together. It’s not a kids’ company, although we do hope you’ll participate with your kids. It’s not an education company, although we do hope that people find it interesting and strategic and creative, but it’s really about using tech to connect people to each other. (Here Lerer declared he was sworn to secrecy by Putnam.)
Putnam on the confluence of AI and hardware and software that seems very much top of mind for founders and investors suddenly:
I think we’re about to enter a golden age of hardware. All the VCs here are going to be so excited to invest in hardware founders soon, hopefully [because a] few things are happening. The iPhone came out 17 years ago, and we haven’t really had a mainstream consumer hardware success story since Oculus. I think there’s an opportunity on the market for something new. A lot of the core components of these technologies are becoming a lot more mature and therefore affordable, so being able to build, in our case, display technologies, is possible in a way now that it wasn’t 10 years ago. And then obviously AI is opening the door for how we interact with our devices. So naturally, there will be new devices on the market. We’re betting on this idea of not another personal computer but rather a new shared device in the home, which is what we did with Mirror and what we’re doing again here. This idea that there will be a piece of tech that helps bring your house and family together is where we think the future is headed.
On not focusing too much on the technical specifications of hardware but focusing more on the overall experience being created, Putnam said:
I learned recently about Nintendo’s design philosophy. They have this concept that they use ‘withered’ technology with lateral thinking. So the idea is using mature, affordable, more readily available technologies but creating a really interesting experience around them, and that is what we did with Mirror. It was rather commodity hardware. It wasn’t frontier tech. And [that’s] what we’re doing again now.
On bringing family and friends together as an investing theme (here, this editor brought up the new startup of Bonobos co-founder Andy Dunn, Pie, which focuses on bringing people together offline), Lerer said:
I’m an investor [in Pie]! Look, I have young kids and I have the same challenges that all my friends have and everyone has: We’re all hopelessly addicted to these devices, and at a high level, we’re interested in alternatives to that addiction and new formats of entertainment or opportunities to get people off of screens or out in the world. We very recently did a [related] deal that’s not yet announced in an application layer AI company in the travel space that I’m really excited about. And we just announced a deal this past week in another application layer company in the aftermarket automotive space, which is actually the biggest hobbyist area by spend in the U.S. Finding ways to tap into people’s passions is always a good bet in the consumer space.
On the feeling that ‘consumer’ as a category is swinging back — including thanks to a new $500 million fund announced this past week by the well-known consumer-focused firm Forerunner Ventures, Lerer said:
As a fund, we’re founder first, but we’re also New York first, and [with] the first [founder] generations of New York in the early 2010s, there was a lot of consumer, a lot of media, a lot of direct-to-consumer commerce. And there were a few trends that really drove that. You had the rise of the iPhone and the App Store. You had social media exploding and the arbitrage ad ecosystem opportunity to go and grab customers faster than ever. Maybe the rise of Shopify as well created a great time to go build consumer businesses with a wide-open imagination.
Over the last four, five, six years, there’s been very little in terms of big tech changes that inspire people to do anything that doesn’t feel incremental. And I do think that AI is that catalyst right now. We’re seeing a very high-quality group of founders saying, “Now’s the time to get back in the pool.” There are things that are possible today that weren’t possible six months ago or a year ago, and the slope is steep right now in terms of using your imagination. So I’m more excited about consumer than I’ve been in a long time, which is really exciting for me because that’s my passion. I built a consumer business. I love investing in consumer founders, and it’s been pretty crappy the last few years, quite frankly."

Yes, the 27-year-old Paul (a YouTuber turned professional boxer) defeated the 58-year-old Tyson (a former heavyweight champion who came out of retirement for this match) in eight rounds, but the real headline was the glitchy experience for audiences watching live on Netflix, with freezing and buffering seemingly a common occurrence.
The #NetflixCrash hashtag was trending on X, and Downdetector said it received over 1 million reports of Netflix issues in 50 countries, including 530,000 reports in the United States, with the issues peaking at around 11 p.m. Eastern.
“This is the biggest event,” Paul declared after the match. “Over 120 million people on Netflix. We crashed the site.”
Netflix has stumbled with live programming before — last year, the broadcast of the Season 4 reunion of “Love Is Blind” was delayed by more than an hour. Since then, the streamer has been ramping up its live lineup with exhibition golf and tennis matches, live talk shows, and awards ceremonies, without major issues.
While the streamer only releases selective data about its viewership, Netflix says 60 million households watched the fight live, with viewership peaking at around 65 million concurrent streams — so it’s probably safe to say that the Tyson/Paul match was the biggest test of Netflix’s live infrastructure to date.
The streamer now has a little over a month to make improvements before airing two NFL games on Christmas Day, followed by WWE Raw in January."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/16/best-gifts-for-frequent-travelers/,Best gifts for frequent travelers | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-16,"What’s the best gift you can get someone? Why, the gift of travel, of course. The next best is something to enhance the travel experience. As fun and enlightening as seeing new places is, the whole part of getting there can detract from the overall experience, especially for those who find themselves traveling a lot for work.
That’s a camp I fall into, and as such, I’ve been curating a selection of gadgets that help make the process of getting from point A to point B a little less arduous. Everything included below is something I use myself and will happily recommend to anyone you’re shopping for.
AirTags and Find My have reprogrammed my brain to a degree that probably isn’t healthy. Any time I misplace something now, my first thought is to reach for my phone. Sadly, the technology isn’t quite that ubiquitous — for now.
Even so, these little watch-battery-powered accessories deliver a lot of peace of mind when it comes to keeping track of your valuables. Pop an AirTag on your luggage, and that’s one less thing to worry about while traveling.
The latest (and priciest) entry in Bose’s perennial favorite travel headphone line look, feel, and sound great. As far as travel companions go for long trips, you can’t beat the QuietComfort Ultra.
If you really want to treat someone this year, the current MacBook Air is a truly excellent travel companion. In fact, the Air is the best laptop Apple has ever made. My one hesitation in recommending it for the holidays is that Apple has yet to introduce an M4 version of the machine. The truth is, however, the M3 is more than enough for most. Heck, even the M2 version — which starts at $999 — is fully capable of running Apple’s new AI suite.
This versatile and extremely slim little charger can manage your iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch. For those who appreciate the freedom of checking in without checking luggage, accessories don’t get much smaller than the Voyage 2. At $100, the price is perhaps a bit steep, but isn’t the whole point of gift-giving getting something for someone they wouldn’t get for themselves?
With Nintendo set to announce its latest console sometime next year, the 2024 holiday season may well bring some deep discounts on products getting a bit long in the tooth. In fact, the portable-only Switch Lite has already had around 10% of its price shaved off on places like Amazon.
I put these earbuds in last year’s guide, even though they hadn’t actually come out yet. Hardware is hard, and the launch was pushed back several times. Now the Ozlo Sleepbuds are here, and I’m happy to include them again. I’m not the sleepy type, but these buds have me out like a light. I plan to take them on all future trips.
The Colorsoft is a fun novelty, but I currently can’t recommend it over Amazon’s tried-and-true Paperwhite. It’s the best-selling Kindle for good reason, and a recent upgrade brings faster page turns and more storage."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/16/tiktok-parent-bytedance-reportedly-values-itself-at-300-billion/,TikTok parent ByteDance reportedly values itself at $300B | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-11-16,"ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, valued itself at $300 billion in a recent share buyback offer, according to a new report in The Wall Street Journal.
That number might sound familiar, as the WSJ previously reported on a ByteDance buyback offer at a $300 billion valuation back in September 2022. But a year later, the company’s valuation had reportedly fallen 26%, to $223 billion.
TikTok’s prospects in the United States may be looking up following the election of Donald Trump to his second term as U.S. president.
In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill that would ban TikTok in the United States if ByteDance failed to sell the short-form video app. The company was given nine months to make the sale, with the president given the option to extend the deadline by an extra three months. (ByteDance is suing the U.S. government over the ban.)
While Trump had also called for a TikTok ban during his first term, he has subsequently posted that he will “SAVE TIK TOK IN AMERICA,” and Republican megadonor Jeff Yass is a major ByteDance investor."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/16/botinkits-robot-wants-to-cook-for-you/,Botinkit’s robot wants to cook for you | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-16,"Warehouses aren’t the only places grappling with a labor crunch. Since the start of the pandemic, restaurants around the world have been grappling with staffing shortages. A number of startups have entered the picture with automation solutions, aimed at reducing the number of hands required to keep the lights on and the food warm.
There are a number of different robotic solutions for the commercial kitchen. Something like Miso is probably the most prominent due, in part, to the novelty of having a robot arm flipping burgers.
Botinkit’s — short for “(ro)Bot in Kit(chen)” — Omni lacks that level of physical flash, instead relying on a more standard kitchen appliance form factor. That is to say, it’s a robot that doesn’t expressly look like a robot. Its looks more like a self-service kiosk, down to the inclusion of a touchscreen. The system is kitchen safe, of course, and designed to be operated by a small staff of humans.
The Omni system can cook, stir-fry, and stew — essentially anything you can cook in a wok, the robot should be able to handle with minimal human intervention. The Shenzhen-based startup says use of an Omni system can effectively halve the human labor requirements in the kitchen.
“When I’m thinking about what the kitchen will look like in 10 years, I’m thinking it should not be the traditional way we see today,” CEO Shirley Chen told TechCrunch. “So we decided to start from the hardest parts, the chef’s parts. When you use chefs, it’s very difficult to control the consistency, because everything is based on human feeling.”
When Chen co-founded Botinkit in 2021, she was both a strategist at British accounting giant KPMG and a restaurant owner. She says the unusual combination of roles put her in a good position to recognize the challenges facing restaurants.
Investors are listening. The company announced a $13 million Series A in July 2023. Through a Series A extension, that number is now $21 million.
Asia continues to be Botinkit’s largest market, but the startup has since expanded into Europe and the U.S. This new funding will go toward expanding the company’s international reach."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/16/spacex-starship-everything-youve-ever-wondered-but-were-afraid-to-ask/,SpaceX Starship: Everything you've ever wondered but were afraid to ask | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-11-16,"SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket has the potential to transform the commercial space economy, ensure America’s position as the global leaders in the space race, and put humans on Mars for the first time. But first it has to get to orbit.
This is becoming much more likely as the Starship test program accelerates and the company demonstrates more and more of the rocket’s powerful capabilities. Yet to many, Starship is still essentially a vanity project from the world’s richest man. This article will attempt to explain the origins of the rocket and where it might be headed.
Standing at nearly 400 feet tall, Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever built. For comparison, the company’s much-used Falcon 9 is 229 feet tall, and the Saturn V that brought Apollo missions to the moon was 363 feet tall.
Starship also represents the reason for SpaceX’s existence: to spread “the light of consciousness,” as Musk puts it, through the solar system, starting with the moon and Mars.
The rocket is composed of two stages: the Super Heavy booster and the second stage, which is also called Starship. At liftoff, the Super Heavy generates an incredible 16.7 million pounds of thrust using its 33 Raptor engines. That’s the amount of power needed to carry upward of 100-150 tons of cargo and crew to low Earth orbit — again, equivalent to the Saturn V but considerably more advanced in several ways.
The biggest change is that Starship is designed to be fully reusable, meaning that eventually both stages would return to the launch site to be rapidly refurbished and reused for the next mission. This would be a first in the history of rocketry. While SpaceX pioneered booster reuse with the Falcon 9 rocket, the upper stage is still left in orbit, to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere.
Reusability, combined with the incredible payload capacity, could drive Starship costs (for SpaceX itself) down to as low as $2 million to $3 million per launch, Musk has claimed. While we don’t have a firm sense of what it costs the company to launch each Falcon 9, because SpaceX’s financials are confidential, they are priced at $69.75 million for the customer.
Interplanetary travel has been embedded in the DNA of SpaceX practically since its inception. Elon Musk has talked about developing a heavy-lift rocket capable of carrying many tons of mass to low Earth orbit, the moon, and even farther for two decades. As early as 2005, Musk was publicly discussing his plans to build a rocket with a payload capacity of 100 tons to send to low Earth orbit.
The rocket now known as Starship has gone under a few different names: the “BFR” and “BFS” (Big F—ing Rocket/Ship or Big Falcon Rocket/Ship, depending on who you ask); the Mars Colonial Transporter; and the Interplanetary Transport System. In July 2019, the small second-stage prototype called “Starhopper” completed a small hop for the first time; that was followed by the first large-scale demonstrator, called SN15, which completed a high-altitude test flight for the first time in May 2021.
Of course, it hasn’t all been rosy: The company has also exploded a fair few prototypes along the way, and its first and second integrated flight tests in April 2023 and November 2023 ended in fiery midair explosions.
The Starship program has accelerated in recent years thanks to two main changes: the launch and operation of Starlink, SpaceX’s internet satellite constellation, which provides critical revenue to fuel Starship development, and a $4 billion Human Landing System (HLS) award from NASA to develop a version of Starship to land humans on the moon for the Artemis program. Which leads us to the next question …
Starship is often understood as one billionaire’s pet project, but that is a deep misreading of the purpose of Starship or the role it could play in the future of the space economy.
Regardless of when Starship might enter commercial operations, pretty much every industry expert agrees that it has the potential to fundamentally transform the space economy. As mentioned above, no other launch vehicle has ever been fully reusable, and those that are partially reusable don’t come close to the rocket’s mammoth size and power.
What does that mean? Well, with the ability to launch cargo in bulk essentially solved, one can begin to imagine many incredible and heretofore unthinkable possibilities — provided the rest of the industry can keep up.
Starship isn’t just a linchpin of growth for the commercial space industry. NASA also pinned the hopes of its Artemis program on the massive launch vehicle when it awarded SpaceX the HLS award in 2021, to deliver the crewed Starship capable of landing astronauts on the moon for the Artemis III mission. That award essentially transformed Starship from one company’s ambition into a major part of ensuring America’s continued supremacy in space.
The sixth flight test is currently scheduled for no earlier than November 18. We break down the main flight objectives of the test here. The company will be attempting to re-create the successes of the previous test flight — including catching the Super Heavy booster using “chopstick” arms jutting out from the launch tower — as well as testing upgrades to hardware and software.
According to Musk’s most recent estimate — which it must be said, his estimates have not historically been particularly reliable — Starship will launch to Mars in 2026. That’s the soonest opportunity for an expedient mission according to the position of the two planets’ orbits around the sun. Whether SpaceX will have the rocket ready in time for such a long mission is unclear, chiefly because there are still some major technical challenges to de-risk, like on-orbit refueling.
That’s right: To reach Mars, or even the moon, for that matter, Starship would need to refuel using a Starship tanker that’s hanging out in orbit. That Starship would transfer propellant to the main vehicle before it could continue its journey. Refueling would need to take place a number of times — for Artemis III, SpaceX estimates needing to launch around 10 refueling tankers to orbit prior to that mission.
The Starship that will go to Mars will not look exactly like the ones flying today, Musk told SpaceX employees in April: The interplanetary Starship will likely be as tall as 500 feet, with even more room for crew and cargo."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/16/t-mobile-hack-linked-to-chinese-breaches-of-telecom-networks/,T-Mobile hack linked to Chinese breaches of telecom networks | TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,2024-11-16,"U.S. phone giant T-Mobile was hacked as part of a broad cyberattack on U.S. and international phone and internet companies in recent months, according to the Wall Street Journal.
T-Mobile said it was “closely monitoring this industry-wide attack, and at this time, T-Mobile systems and data have not been impacted in any significant way, and we have no evidence of impacts to customer information,” according to a statement shared with TechCrunch.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the breach at T-Mobile, citing sources familiar with the campaign targeting telecom giants.
A T-Mobile spokesperson, who did not provide their name, would not say if the company had the technical means, such as logs, to determine what, if any, customer data was accessed or exfiltrated. The spokesperson did not dispute the Journal’s reporting.
T-Mobile is the latest telecommunications company in recent weeks said to be hit by an intrusion, linked to a series of cyberattacks targeting phone and internet companies, including AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen (formerly CenturyLink). The hacks, conducted by a group of hackers working for the Chinese government dubbed Salt Typhoon, targeted the wiretap systems that U.S. phone and internet companies are required under a 30-year-old federal law to allow government access to customer data.
The FBI and U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA went public this week to warn the wider industry of linked cyberattacks, accusing China of conducting a “broad and significant cyber espionage campaign” aimed at targeting the call records and text messages of high-ranking American officials, including presidential candidates.
This is the ninth known cyberattack to target T-Mobile in recent years, according to an ongoing count by TechCrunch. The most recent breach at T-Mobile was in 2023, leading to the theft of personal information from 37 million T-Mobile customers.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/16/what-a-second-trump-term-means-for-the-future-of-ransomware/,What a second Trump term means for the future of ransomware | TechCrunch,Carly Page,2024-11-16,"The U.S. government has made big strides over the past four years in the ongoing fight against the “scourge of ransomware,” as President Joe Biden described it.
At the start of his term, Biden and his administration were quick to declare ransomware a national security threat, unlocking new powers for the military and intelligence agencies. Since then, the United States has successfully disrupted ransomware infrastructure, clawed back millions in ransom payments, and targeted some of the most notorious ransomware operators with indictments and sanctions.
Despite the government’s onslaught of enforcement of late, the number of cyberattacks targeting U.S. organizations continues to rise, with 2024 set to be another record-breaking year for ransomware. This means when President-elect Donald Trump again takes office in January, he, too, will inherit a major ransomware problem.
While it’s difficult to predict what the next four years of cybersecurity policy could look like, the industry at large is bracing for change.
“It is hard to say what will happen with policy and regulation in the future as there are many layers, and players, involved in change,” Marcin Kleczynski, the chief executive at antimalware giant Malwarebytes, told TechCrunch. “However, I know that cyberattacks won’t stop, regardless of who is in office,” said Kleczynski, citing ransomware as a top concern.
From a cybersecurity point of view, Trump’s first term as president was a mixed bag. One of Trump’s first (albeit delayed) executive orders after taking office in 2017 required federal agencies to immediately assess their cybersecurity risks. Then, in 2018, the Trump administration unveiled the U.S. government’s first national cybersecurity strategy in more than a decade, leading to more aggressive “name-and-shame” attribution policies and the easing of rules to allow intelligence agencies to “hack-back” at adversaries with offensive cyberattacks.
In late 2018, Congress passed a law founding CISA, a new federal cybersecurity agency tasked with protecting U.S. critical infrastructure. The Trump administration chose Chris Krebs as the agency’s first director, only for the then-president to summarily fire Krebs by tweet two years later for stating that the 2020 election — which Trump lost — was “the most secure in American history,” in contradiction of Trump’s false claims that the election was “rigged.”
While cybersecurity hasn’t featured heavily in Trump’s messaging since, the Republican National Committee, which backed Trump for office, said during the 2024 election cycle that an incoming Republican administration would “raise the security standards for our critical systems and networks.”
Trump’s push to slash federal budgets as part of his pledge to reduce government spending has sparked concerns that agencies may have fewer resources available for cybersecurity, potentially leaving federal networks more vulnerable to cyberattacks.
This comes at a time when U.S. networks are already under attack from adversarial nations. Federal agencies have warned this year of the “broad and unrelenting threat” by China-backed hackers, most recently sounding the alarm over the successful infiltration of multiple U.S. telecom providers to access real-time call and text logs.
Project 2025, a detailed blueprint written by influential conservative think-tank The Heritage Foundation, which reportedly serves as a “wish-list” of proposals to be taken up during a second Trump term, also wants the president to pursue legislation that would dismantle the entire Department of Homeland Security and shift CISA to operate under the Department of Transportation.
Lisa Sotto, partner at American law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, told TechCrunch that deregulation will be an overarching theme of the Trump administration.
“This could impact CISA’s role in shaping cybersecurity regulations for critical infrastructure, potentially leading to an emphasis on self-regulation,” said Sotto.
Referring to new guidelines proposed by CISA in March that would require critical infrastructure companies to disclose breaches within three days beginning next year, Sotto said these so-called CIRCIA rules “may also be significantly revised to shrink the requirements around cyber incident reporting and related obligations.”
That could mean fewer required data breach notifications of ransomware incidents and ultimately less visibility into ransom payments, which security researchers have long cited as a problem.
Allan Liska, a ransomware expert and threat analyst at cybersecurity company Recorded Future, told TechCrunch in October that much of the hard work done by the United States over the last four years, including the creation of an international coalition of governments vowing not to pay a hacker’s ransom, could become an early casualty to wide-scale government deregulation.
“The global ransomware taskforce that President Biden set up has accelerated a lot of law enforcement activity because it’s opened up the exchange of information,” said Liska. “There’s a good chance that goes away, or at least that the U.S. is no longer part of that,” he said, also warning of a risk in increasing ransomware attacks with less intelligence sharing.
With a scaled back focus on regulation, a second Trump term could pick up where it left off with offensive cyberattacks and employ a more aggressive approach in a bid to tackle the ransomware problem.
Casey Ellis, founder of crowdsourced security platform Bugcrowd, says he expects to see a ramping up of U.S. offensive cyber capabilities, including an increased use of hacking-back.
“Trump has a history of supporting initiatives that pursue an outcome that deters enemies to U.S. sovereign security,” Ellis told TechCrunch.
“I’d expect this to include the use of offensive cyber capabilities, as well as ramping up the kind of ‘hack-back’ activities we’ve seen out of the partnership between FBI and DOJ over the past several years,” said Ellis, referring to the government’s disruption efforts against botnets, DDoS booter sites, and malware operations in recent years. “The kind of ransomware, initial access broker, cybercriminal infrastructure, and quasi-government operations previously targeted by the U.S. government would continue to be a focus.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/16/eu-ai-act-everything-you-need-to-know/,EU AI Act: Everything you need to know | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-11-16,"The European Union’s risk-based rulebook for artificial intelligence — aka the EU AI Act — has been years in the making. But expect to hear a lot more about the regulation in the coming months (and years) as key compliance deadlines kick in. Meanwhile, read on for an overview of the law and its aims.
So what is the EU trying to achieve? Dial back the clock to April 2021, when the Commission published the original proposal and lawmakers were framing it as a law to bolster the bloc’s ability to innovate in AI by fostering trust among citizens. The framework would ensure AI technologies remained “human-centered” while also giving businesses clear rules to work their machine learning magic, the EU suggested.
Increasing adoption of automation across industry and society certainly has the potential to supercharge productivity in various domains. But it also poses risks of fast-scaling harms if outputs are poor and/or where AI intersects with individual rights and fails to respect them.
The bloc’s goal for the AI Act is therefore to drive uptake of AI and grow a local AI ecosystem by setting conditions that are intended to shrink the risks that things could go horribly wrong. Lawmakers think that having guardrails in place will boost citizens’ trust in and uptake of AI.
This ecosystem-fostering-through-trust idea was fairly uncontroversial back in the early part of the decade, when the law was being discussed and drafted. Objections were raised in some quarters, though, that it was simply too early to be regulating AI and that European innovation and competitiveness could suffer.
Few would likely say it’s too early now, of course, given how the technology has exploded into mainstream consciousness thanks to the boom in generative AI tools. But there are still objections that the law sandbags the prospects of homegrown AI entrepreneurs, despite the inclusion of support measures like regulatory sandboxes.
Even so, the big debate for many lawmakers is now around how to regulate AI, and with the AI Act the EU has set its course. The next years are all about the bloc executing on the plan.
Most uses of AI are not regulated under the AI Act at all, as they fall out of scope of the risk-based rules. (It’s also worth noting that military uses of AI are entirely out of scope as national security is a member-state, rather than EU-level, legal competence.)
For in-scope uses of AI, the Act’s risk-based approach sets up a hierarchy where a handful of potential use cases (e.g., “harmful subliminal, manipulative and deceptive techniques” or “unacceptable social scoring”) are framed as carrying “unacceptable risk” and are therefore banned. However, the list of banned uses is replete with exceptions, meaning even the law’s small number of prohibitions carry plenty of caveats.
For example, a ban on law enforcement using real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces is not the blanket ban some parliamentarians and many civil society groups had pushed for, with exceptions allowing its use for certain crimes.
The next tier down from unacceptable risk/banned use is “high-risk” use cases — such as AI apps used for critical infrastructure; law enforcement; education and vocational training; healthcare; and more — where app makers must conduct conformity assessments prior to market deployment, and on an ongoing basis (such as when they make substantial updates to models).
This means the developer must be able to demonstrate that they are meeting the law’s requirements in areas such as data quality, documentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy, cybersecurity, and robustness. They must put in place quality and risk-management systems so they can demonstrate compliance if an enforcement authority comes knocking to do an audit.
High-risk systems that are deployed by public bodies must also be registered in a public EU database.
There is also a third, “medium-risk” category, which applies transparency obligations to AI systems, such as chatbots or other tools that can be used to produce synthetic media. Here the concern is they could be used to manipulate people, so this type of tech requires that users are informed they are interacting with or viewing content produced by AI.
All other uses of AI are automatically considered low/minimal risk and aren’t regulated. This means that, for example, stuff like using AI to sort and recommend social media content or target advertising doesn’t have any obligations under these rules. But the bloc encourages all AI developers to voluntarily follow best practices for boosting user trust.
This set of tiered risk-based rules make up the bulk of the AI Act. But there are also some dedicated requirements for the multifaceted models that underpin generative AI technologies — which the AI Act refers to as “general purpose AI” models (or GPAIs).
This subset of AI technologies, which the industry sometimes calls “foundational models,” typically sits upstream of many apps that implement artificial intelligence. Developers are tapping into APIs from the GPAIs to deploy these models’ capabilities into their own software, often fine-tuned for a specific use case to add value. All of which is to say that GPAIs have quickly gained a powerful position in the market, with the potential to influence AI outcomes at a large scale.
The rise of GenAI reshaped more than just the conversation around the EU’s AI Act; it led to changes to the rulebook itself as the bloc’s lengthy legislative process coincided with the hype around GenAI tools like ChatGPT. Lawmakers in the European parliament seized their chance to respond.
MEPs proposed adding additional rules for GPAIs — that is, the models that underlie GenAI tools. These, in turn, sharpened tech industry attention on what the EU was doing with the law, leading to some fierce lobbying for a carve-out for GPAIs.
French AI firm Mistral was one of the loudest voices, arguing that rules on model makers would hold back Europe’s ability to compete against AI giants from the U.S. and China. OpenAI’s Sam Altman also chipped in, suggesting, in a side remark to journalists that it might pull its tech out of Europe if laws proved too onerous, before hurriedly falling back to traditional flesh-pressing (lobbying) of regional powerbrokers after the EU called him out on this clumsy threat.
Altman getting a crash course in European diplomacy has been one of the more visible side effects of the AI Act.
The upshot of all this noise was a white-knuckle ride to get the legislative process wrapped. It took months and a marathon final negotiating session between the European parliament, Council, and Commission to push the file over the line last year. The political agreement was clinched in December 2023, paving the way for adoption of the final text in May 2024.
The EU has trumpeted the AI Act as a “global first.” But being first in this cutting-edge tech context means there’s still a lot of detail to be worked out, such as setting the specific standards in which the law will apply and producing detailed compliance guidance (Codes of Practice) in order for the oversight and ecosystem-building regime the Act envisages to function.
So, as far as assessing its success, the law remains a work in progress — and will be for a long time.
For GPAIs, the AI Act continues the risk-based approach, with (only) lighter requirements for most of these models.
For commercial GPAIs, this means transparency rules (including technical documentation requirements and disclosures around the use of copyrighted material used to train models). These provisions are intended to help downstream developers with their own AI Act compliance.
There’s also a second tier — for the most powerful (and potentially risky) GPAIs — where the Act dials up obligations on model makers by requiring proactive risk assessment and risk mitigation for GPAIs with “systemic risk.”
Here the EU is concerned about very powerful AI models that might pose risks to human life, for example, or even risks that tech makers lose control over continued development of self-improving AIs.
Lawmakers elected to rely on compute threshold for model training as a classifier for this systemic risk tier. GPAIs will fall into this bracket based on the cumulative amount of compute used for their training being measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) of greater than 1025.
So far no models are thought to be in scope, but of course that could change as GenAI continues to develop.
There is also some leeway for AI safety experts involved in oversight of the AI Act to flag concerns about systemic risks that may arise elsewhere. (For more on the governance structure the bloc has devised for the AI Act — including the various roles of the AI Office — see our earlier report.)
Mistral et al.’s lobbying did result in a watering down of the rules for GPAIs, with lighter requirements on open source providers for example (lucky Mistral!). R&D also got a carve out, meaning GPAIs that have not yet been commercialized fall out of scope of the Act entirely, without even transparency requirements applying.
The AI Act officially entered into force across the EU on August 1, 2024. That date essentially fired a starting gun as deadlines for complying with different components are set to hit at different intervals from early next year until around the middle of 2027.
Some of the main compliance deadlines are six months in from entry into force, when rules on prohibited use cases kick in; nine months in when Codes of Practice start to apply; 12 months in for transparency and governance requirements; 24 months for other AI requirements, including obligations for some high-risk systems; and 36 months for other high-risk systems.
Part of the reason for this staggered approach to legal provisions is about giving companies enough time to get their operations in order. But even more than that, it’s clear that time is needed for regulators to work out what compliance looks like in this cutting-edge context.
At the time of writing, the bloc is busy formulating guidance for various aspects of the law ahead of these deadlines, such as Codes of Practice for makers of GPAIs. The EU is also consulting on the law’s definition of “AI systems” (i.e., which software will be in scope or out) and clarifications related to banned uses of AI.
The full picture of what the AI Act will mean for in-scope companies is still being shaded in and fleshed out. But key details are expected to be locked down in the coming months and into the first half of next year.
One more thing to consider: As a consequence of the pace of development in the AI field, what’s required to stay on the right side of the law will likely continue to shift as these technologies (and their associated risks) continue evolving, too. So this is one rulebook that may well need to remain a living document.
Oversight of GPAIs is centralized at EU level, with the AI Office playing a key role. Penalties the Commission can reach for to enforce these rules can reach up to 3% of model makers’ global turnover.
Elsewhere, enforcement of the Act’s rules for AI systems is decentralized, meaning it will be down to member state-level authorities (plural, as there may be more than one oversight body designated) to assess and investigate compliance issues for the bulk of AI apps. How workable this structure will be remains to be seen.
On paper, penalties can reach up to 7% of global turnover (or €35 million, whichever is greater) for breaches of banned uses. Violations of other AI obligations can be sanctioned with fines of up to 3% of global turnover, or up to 1.5% for providing incorrect information to regulators. So there’s a sliding scale of sanctions enforcement authorities can reach for."

Called “dAIsy,” it mimics an older woman with all kinds of time to chat — about knitting, her cat Fluffy — with the aim of keeping fraudsters endlessly engaged as they try obtaining her (fake) bank details.
A press release about O2’s “AI Granny” says it combines “various AI models” that transcribe the caller’s voice into text before generating a response through a custom large language model, then feeding it through a text-to-speech model to produce a voice answer. The AI was trained in part by Jim Browning, a “scambait” expert with a huge YouTube following.
It’s fun to see in practice. (O2 says the audio in the video below is real.) If it makes a dent, all the better. Last year, the FBI reported that people over age 60 were swindled out of $3.4 billion via telephone scams, up from $3.1 billion in 2022. With generative AI taking off — and voice impersonation with it — those numbers are poised to balloon."

The social network made the announcement on the same day that X (formerly Twitter) is implementing its new terms of service that allow the platform to use public posts to train AI.
“A number of artists and creators have made their home on Bluesky, and we hear their concerns with other platforms training on their data,” Bluesky said in a post on its app. “We do not use any of your content to train generative AI, and have no intention of doing so.”
The company went on to note that it uses AI internally to help with content moderation and that it also uses the technology in its “Discover” algorithmic feed. However, Bluesky says “none of these are Gen AI systems trained on user content.”
Over on X, the Elon Musk-owned social network has detailed how posting on the platform grants the company license to “analyze text and other information you provide and to otherwise provide, promote, and improve the Services, including, for example, for use with and training of our machine learning and artificial intelligence models, whether generative or another type.”
Bluesky has seen an increase in users following the U.S. presidential election as X gains more of a right-wing approach, especially after Musk used the platform to campaign for President-elect Donald Trump.
The startup revealed on Thursday evening that over 1 million people signed up for the platform in the last 24 hours. Today, it has 17.14 million users as of the time of writing.
Despite the increase in users, it’s worth noting that Meta’s Threads is still the largest X competitor, as it has over 275 million monthly active users, and 15 million new signups so far this month."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/nso-group-admits-cutting-off-10-customers-because-they-abused-its-pegasus-spyware-say-unsealed-court-documents/,"NSO Group admits cutting off 10 customers because they abused its Pegasus spyware, say unsealed court documents | TechCrunch",Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-11-15,"On Thursday, WhatsApp scored a legal victory by convincing a U.S. federal judge to publicly release three court documents that include new revelations about the inner workings of Pegasus, the spyware made by Israeli surveillance tech maker NSO Group.
The newly unsealed documents include information coming from depositions of NSO employees during the legal proceedings, internal company documents, as well as — ironically — WhatsApp messages exchanged between NSO employees, which WhatsApp obtained by sending subpoenas to NSO.
The documents also reveal that NSO disconnected 10 government customers in recent years from accessing the Pegasus spyware, citing abuse of its service.
This release of new revelations is the latest development in the lawsuit that WhatsApp filed in 2019, accusing NSO of violating the anti-hacking law, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and breaching WhatsApp’s terms of service, by accessing WhatsApp servers and targeting individual users with spyware sent over the chat app. The accusations are based on a series of cyberattacks against WhatsApp users, including journalists, dissidents, and human rights advocates.
“The evidence unveiled shows exactly how NSO’s operations violated U.S. law and launched their cyber-attacks against journalists, human rights activists and civil society,” WhatsApp spokesperson Zade Alsawah said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. “We are going to continue working to hold NSO accountable and protect our users.”
According to the court documents, seen by TechCrunch, NSO had developed a suite of hacking tools to be used against targets using WhatsApp, capable of accessing private data on the target’s phone. The hacking suite was called “Hummingbird,” and two of the suite’s exploits were dubbed “Eden” and “Heaven.”
This suite cost NSO’s government customers — namely police departments and intelligence agencies — up to $6.8 million for a one-year license, and netted NSO “at least $31 million in revenue in 2019, according to one of the court documents.
Thanks to these hacking tools, NSO installed Pegasus on “between hundreds and tens of thousands” of target devices, according to a deposition by NSO’s head of research and development Tamir Gazneli.
Until now, it wasn’t clear who was actually sending the malicious WhatsApp messages to target individuals with spyware. For years, NSO has claimed to have no knowledge of customers’ operations, and not be involved in carrying out the targeted cyberattacks. The newly released court documents cast doubt on some of NSO’s claims.
WhatsApp argued in one of the court documents that, “NSO’s customers’ role is minimal,” given that the government customers only needed to input the phone number of the target’s device and, citing an NSO employee, “press Install, and Pegasus will install the agent on the device remotely without any engagement.”
“In other words, the customer simply places an order for a target device’s data, and NSO controls every aspect of the data retrieval and delivery process through its design of Pegasus,” WhatsApp argued.
The court filings cited an NSO employee as saying it “was our decision whether to trigger [the exploit] using WhatsApp messages or not,” referring to one of the exploits the company offered its customers.
When reached for comment, NSO spokesperson Gil Lainer said in a statement to TechCrunch: “NSO stands behind its previous statements in which we repeatedly detailed that the system is operated solely by our clients and that neither NSO nor its employees have access to the intelligence gathered by the system.”
“We are confident that these claims, like many others in the past, will be proven wrong in court, and we look forward to the opportunity to do so,” said NSO’s Lainer.
One technique that NSO used to allow its customers to target WhatsApp users, described in one document, was to set up something the company called a “WhatsApp Installation Server,” or WIS, which WhatsApp calls a “fake client.” This was essentially a modified version of the WhatsApp app that NSO developed and used to send messages — including their malicious exploits — to regular WhatsApp users. NSO admitted setting up real WhatsApp accounts for its customers, per one of the court documents.
WhatsApp was able to defeat both NSO’s “Eden” and “Heaven” exploits with patches and security updates, according to an internal NSO communication.
“Eden/Heaven/Hummingbird R.I.P. announcement,” read a message sent to NSO employees.
The court documents show that NSO’s Heaven exploit was active before 2018, and was designed to direct target WhatsApp devices into communicating with a malicious WhatsApp relay server controlled by NSO.
After WhatsApp patched its systems against NSO’s Heaven exploit, NSO developed a new exploit called “Eden,” which an NSO employee quoted by the court documents said, “need[ed] to go through WhatsApp relay servers,” which the Heaven exploit had sought to avoid. It was the use of the Eden exploit that led to WhatsApp filing its lawsuit against NSO, according to a deposition by another NSO employee.
A third exploit developed by NSO, revealed in the documents, was called “Erised,” a so-called “zero-click” exploit that could compromise a victim’s phone without any interaction from the victim. WhatsApp blocked the use of NSO’s Erised exploit in May 2020, several months after WhatsApp had filed its lawsuit.
Another interesting detail that surfaced this week is the admission by one of the NSO employees deposed in the course of the lawsuit that Pegasus was used against Dubai’s Princess Haya, a case that was reported by the The Guardian and The Washington Post in 2021, and later by The New Yorker in 2023.
The same NSO employee said the spyware maker “disconnected” access to Pegasus for 10 customers, citing abuse of the spyware.
At this point in the legal case, WhatsApp is asking the judge to issue a summary judgment in the case, and is awaiting a decision.
Meanwhile, the details that have come out from the lawsuit this week could help other people who have sued NSO in other countries, according to Natalia Krapiva, the tech legal counsel at Access Now, a nonprofit that has investigated some cases of abuse carried out with NSO’s spyware.
“WhatsApp’s sticking with their legal action finally reaps some benefits,” Krapiva told TechCrunch. “While it is true that NSO has not been sharing much information (especially things like Pegasus codes, list of customers, etc.), the information that they did share is already quite useful for this case but also for legal cases against NSO around the world.”
“And the fact that NSO hides information also cuts both ways because it also makes it very difficult for them to present a solid defense,” said Krapiva."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/openai-at-one-point-considered-acquiring-ai-chip-startup-cerebras/,OpenAI at one point considered acquiring AI chip startup Cerebras | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-15,"OpenAI was at one point considering acquiring Cerebras, an AI chipmaking company that’s in the process of going public, according to new legal filings.
Elon Musk’s ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI has new exhibits that describe how OpenAI was contemplating snatching up Cerebras in or around 2017 — a year after Cerebras’ founding, and just a few years after OpenAI began operating.
In an email addressed to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, Ilya Sutskever, one of OpenAI’s co-founders and ex-chief scientist, floated the idea of buying Cerebras through Tesla, Musk’s EV company. At the time, Musk was financially involved in OpenAI and exerted some influence over its direction.
“In the event we decide to buy Cerebras, my strong sense is that it’ll be done through Tesla,” Sutskever wrote in September 2017. “But why do it this way if we could also do it from within OpenAI? Specifically, the concern is that Tesla has a duty to shareholders to maximize shareholder return, which is not aligned with OpenAI’s mission. So the overall result may not end up being optimal for OpenAI.”
In an earlier email dated July 2017 from Sutskever to Musk and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman (now the company’s president), Sutskever mentions several Cerebras-related agenda items: “Negotiate merger terms with Cerebras” and “More due diligence with Cerebras.”
The merger deal would ultimately fall through, although it’s not clear from the exhibits why. And OpenAI would end up shelving its chip ambitions for years.
Cerebras, based in Sunnyvale, California, builds custom hardware to run and train AI models and claims its chips are faster and more efficient than Nvidia’s flagship offerings for AI workloads.
Having raised $715 million in venture capital, Cerebras is reportedly seeking to roughly double its $4 billion valuation through the IPO. But it faces considerable challenges. A single Abu Dhabi firm, G42, accounted for 87% of Cerebras’ revenue in the first half of 2024, and U.S. lawmakers have expressed unease about G42′s historic ties to China. Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman also has a checkered past, having pled guilty to circumventing accounting controls while a VP at public company Riverstone Networks.
If the acquisition had happened, it could have benefited both companies. Cerebras would’ve avoided the path to a tricky IPO, while OpenAI might’ve had a vital resource in its race to build in-house chips.
OpenAI has long sought to reduce its reliance on Nvidia, which commands a massive share of the market for AI-optimized chips. While OpenAI is late to the in-house chip game — Google and Amazon Web Services, among others, have long offered chips designed for AI workloads — it’s under pressure to reduce the cost of model training, fine-tuning, and running. Having its own chips could be one way to attain the reductions it needs.
OpenAI at one point hoped to establish a network of factories for chip manufacturing, and was considering an acquisition target. But it’s reportedly abandoned those plans in favor of aggressively building out a team of chip designers and engineers, and working with semiconductor firms Broadcom and TSMC to create an AI chip for running models. It could arrive as soon as 2026."

Despite the short workweek in many locations, the last few days have been crammed with deal announcements and funding news, although it is too early to tell how much was just on hold before the U.S. election.
There are early signs that the U.S. IPO window may reopen, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves; for now, we mostly have IPOs in India, M&As, and not-so-great news.
IPO later: European scale-up Klarna confidentially filed IPO documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). After ups and downs, the buy now, pay later (BNPL) company reportedly saw its valuation rise back to $14.6 billion earlier this year.
IPO envy: Naspers-owned Prosus aims to take Indian fintech PayU public in 2025. The Dutch investor looks to shift more focus to India, where quick-commerce company Swiggy just made a stellar IPO debut.
Dark web monitoring: Cybersecurity unicorn Bitsight bought dark web security specialist Cybersixgill for $115 million.
Moving the cursor: Anysphere, the startup behind popular AI-enabled code editor Cursor, acquired competitor Supermaven, which had raised $12 million. Anysphere reportedly received unsolicited investment offers at valuations of up to $2.5 billion.
Out of power: Beleaguered battery manufacturer Northvolt is selling some assets to Lyten, a Silicon Valley battery startup, but it is unclear whether deal proceeds and other cost-cutting measures will be enough for the Swedish company to get through the coming year.
Startups may simply be rushing to publicize their latest news before Thanksgiving, but there were quite a few rounds announced this week, including some big ones.
Writing checks: Writer raised a $200 million Series C round at a $1.9 billion valuation to expand its enterprise-focused generative AI platform.
Quiet funding: British AI startup Tessl opened up a waitlist and disclosed it raised $125 million to date. This includes a previously undisclosed seed round and a Series A. The latter was led by Index Ventures — at a $750 million post-money valuation, according to sources.
Scaling up: ScaleOps, a New York-based cloud spend management company, closed a $58 million Series B funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners that will help it grow its current 60-person headcount to more than 200 by 2026.
Cash flow: French fintech company Agicap secured $48 million in Series C funding for its cash-flow management platform. The startup targets midsized companies and has 8,000 customers with around half of them in France.
Satellite service: U.S. startup Starfish Space raised a $29 million round of funding led by major defense tech investor Shield Capital. Its goal is to launch three full-size satellite servicing and inspection spacecraft in 2026.
New heights: VC firm Altos Ventures raised $500 million for its latest fund, according to SEC filings. The Silicon Valley-based investor was an early backer of Coupang and Roblox.
Stepping down: The co-CEO of SoftBank Vision Fund, Rajeev Misra, will step down from his leadership roles after a 10-year tenure and will no longer have an official role at SoftBank, the company said.
Station F, the iconic startup campus in Paris, disclosed its top 40 startups of the year, and almost all of them — 34, to be precise — use AI. Hence Romain Dillet’s prediction: “It’s clear that every new startup going forward will incorporate AI in some way.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/i-went-to-greenland-to-try-to-buy-it-meet-the-founder-who-wants-to-re-create-mars-on-earth/,'I went to Greenland to try to buy it': Meet the founder who wants to recreate Mars on Earth | TechCrunch,Margaux MacColl,2024-11-15,"Last summer, a twin-propeller plane touched down on the gray-cratered terrain of Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. A 28-year-old deboarded, ready to march into the Nordic parliament building with a bold proposition: “I went to Greenland to try to buy it,” Praxis founder Dryden Brown wrote in a viral tweet later.
On the phone with TechCrunch last week, he filed down his edgelord bluster. “Obviously they have a sort of sense of pride that makes the idea of being bought — it’s almost, like, condescending,” he said. “But they would actually like to be independent.”
So, rather than buying Greenland, he wondered whether he could work with the government to create a new city, purposefully built on uninhabitable land. “What if we can sort of build a prototype of Terminus?” he said, referencing Elon Musk’s preferred name for a city on Mars.
A member of the Danish parliament was not amused. “Greenlandic independence requires approval by the Danish parliament and a change of our constitution,” politician Rasmus Jarlov tweeted. “I can guarantee you that there is no way we would approve independence so that you could buy Greenland.”
But, if building a new city in Greenland were just a question of financials, Brown has the resources to do it — kind of. For the last five years, Brown, along with co-founder Charlie Callinan, has been at the helm of Praxis, a network state startup with the explicit goal of creating a city. He emphasized Praxis as an internet-first ideology — one that has courted controversy, like when a Praxis member guide reportedly said that “traditional, European/Western beauty standards on which the civilized world, at its best points, has always found success.”
Despite the controversy, the Peter Thiel-backed project recently raised $525 million, with a major asterisk: The startup has the ability to draw down the money as it hits specific milestones in its city-building project.
So for now, Praxis is an internet ideology in search of a physical home. The group hosted 250 Praxis-supporters in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, earlier this month, where attendees like Bedrock’s Geoff Lewis and Mamuka Bakhtadze, former prime minister of Georgia, were presented with different location options for Praxis.
Praxis is one of the prominent examples of a “network state,” a term defined by former a16z investor Balaji Srinivasan, as an internet community that acquires a physical home and “gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states,” he wrote. Marc Andreessen has praised the concept, and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin created his own network state experiment.
But, while most current network state projects so far have been short-term, Brown wants to take it to a greater extreme. For years now, he’s traveled from country to country, cold-emailing politicians and inquiring about the potential for a techno-optimist city. “In my early 20s, I didn’t know anyone, and I flew to Nigeria, in sort of the same way that I flew to Greenland,” he told TechCrunch. He pinged politicians on LinkedIn and said he managed to get meetings with top level politicians, like Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, vice president of Ghana.
He’s since traveled to dozens of countries with the same proposal: “It’s basically finding a sort of opportunity for mutual benefit between a group of founders who want to build something new and exciting, and a country that would benefit from that.”
In Greenland, between a polar plunge and some light marathon training, Brown met with government officials, mining tycoons, and local entrepreneurs. Brown’s main takeaway was that many residents would like Greenland to be free from Denmark, but the government feels bound by the roughly $500 million that Denmark gives to the country every year.
“If we could replace the $500M with another revenue source — taxes from a new city, mining, and tourism post-terraforming — we could derisk accession, and get Greenlanders get their long-sought independence — and with it vast wealth,” Brown tweeted.
Brown wants the potential Greenland city to be a bastion of technological experimentation, specifically drawing on the community of young male hardtech founders that have gathered in El Segundo. Imagine, he said, a city that can create rain on demand using Rainmaker technology, a cloud-seeding startup, or a community powered by nuclear technology from Valar Atomics.
You’d think convincing Praxis members to move to a desolate, freezing country, rather than, say, the Dominican Republic, would be a tough sell. Brown insisted it’s the opposite. “That is the thing about Praxis members,” he said. “A bunch of people that actually would move to Greenland because it’s hardcore.”
To hear Brown tell it, the Praxis community is a return to an old Americana sensibility, where there’s land to be conquered and a hegemonic international structure to dominate. You can see it in El Segundo, where hardware startups compete for the biggest American flag, and you can see it in Brown, who feels like he embodies a new-age manifest destiny. “My ancestors came to America from Ireland in the early 18th century. They took this voyage on ships across the Atlantic, landed, built a town and a fort and a farm, fought in the Revolutionary War,” he said. “I think it’s important to build things that honor your ancestors and sacrifices they’ve made.”
He believes that Americans have an impulse for “heroism and courage,” and, well, expansion. “It feels like that sort of fire was at least temporarily extinguished,” he continued. “It was like, you just couldn’t really do that stuff in the U.S. — or at least it was like, super hard. It was basically impossible. You can’t build any cities. There’s nowhere new to go.”
In Brown’s story, President-elect Donald Trump appears like a deus ex machina, a balm to a rowdy America chafing against its own borders. “Trump wants to do that, building new cities,” he said. Trump is “reviving classical aesthetics” and ushering in a culture shift for Americans to be “undaunted” by ambitious proposals, like, say, building a prototype of Terminus.
Between the support for a potential Greenland city, and the red wave washing over America, Brown feels vindicated. Several years ago, Brown said he faced “an insane number of people trying to ostracize us — or lightly cancel us or whatever — for having these sort of right-coded aesthetics and big ambitions,” he said. “And now they’re tweeting about all these things incessantly.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/think-you-need-a-vpn-guide-start-here/,Think you need a VPN? Start here. | TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,2024-11-15,"If you’ve landed on this page, there’s a good chance that you’re looking for a VPN, or virtual private network. Perhaps someone recommended a certain product or service, or an advert caught your curiosity? You might be privacy-minded, or simply want to stay private online in an ever-changing world.
Before you take the plunge into unfamiliar waters, we’re here to tell you that you might not actually need a VPN after all.
VPNs today make a lot of promises, from defending your privacy from surveillance to improving your internet speeds and protecting against malicious online threats. In simple terms, VPN providers funnel all of your device’s internet traffic through their own systems, under the premise that the provider shields your information from outside prying eyes, like governments, online advertisers, and even your home internet provider.
The problem is, how do you trust that a VPN provider will protect all of your private internet browsing information? The simple answer is that you can’t and shouldn’t trust either free or paid VPN providers. As TechCrunch’s Romain Dillet says in our explainer of what VPNs are and what they do, VPNs are only helpful in a handful of situations. For some, using a VPN can be as dangerous as not using one.
There is good news! The simple flowchart below can help you decide if you need a VPN for your situation, or if there are better options for what you’re looking for.
In the cases where you might need a VPN, the best VPN provider is one that you have made yourself. We have a simple guide on how to set up your own encrypted VPN server, including with open source software that’s been reviewed and audited by security professionals.
And, if you don’t think you need a VPN, we look at the privacy tools and the other measures you can take to improve your privacy online.

VPN may help
If you live in a part of the world where a government or authority is restricting access to the internet or blocking certain websites, it’s likely that you’re subject to censorship. This means that the government may also have the ability to monitor the regional internet traffic and decide which websites and services you can and cannot access.
In cases where certain websites are blocked, a VPN could allow you to access a website as though you were coming from another part of the world entirely, wherever that VPN server is located. But governments are known to block the IP address ranges that VPN providers use, rendering the VPN ineffective or unusable.
To bypass censorship, it’s far better to use Tor, a network service that encrypts, scrambles, and anonymizes internet traffic through multiple different proxy servers as you browse the web. Because your encrypted internet traffic continuously travels through different servers to ensure anonymity, the Tor Network is typically slower to browse than the regular internet, but it’s capable of evading regional internet censorship.
Back to top.
Regardless of whether or not you’re subject to censorship, you may simply want to browse the web anonymously without anyone knowing that it’s you.
Browsing the web leaves a lot of digital footsteps behind you. Websites know that you’ve visited them thanks to the army of ad trackers planted on each web page (and tell other sites what you’re looking at, too). Your internet provider, which routes your browsing data over the internet, might be collecting information about your browsing habits, storing it for an unspecified amount of time, and monetizing it.
And your government can seek grounds to demand access to your browsing data anytime it wants — including retroactively — which can also include demands to access data from VPN providers, defeating the very point of the privacy you sought.
You can avoid online surveillance by not leaving behind a trace of personal information to begin with. We recommend browsing the web using Tor for anonymity, as Tor routes your internet traffic through multiple servers around the world to ensure that no one server can see your browsing data. As such, Tor can be slower to load than the regular internet, all the while still providing top-notch privacy benefits.
Back to top.
Security experts consider the Tor network the gold standard of private browsing because it allows you to access the internet without censorship or surveillance.
Instead of relying on a single tunnel to hide your internet traffic, Tor works by encrypting and routing users’ internet traffic through thousands of servers around the world, shielding their activity from other servers and the outside world. Because of Tor’s implementation, no single Tor server can see your browsing data. That means even if a Tor server is compromised, the attacker still cannot access the users’ browsing data within.
Because Tor is open source, anyone can inspect its source code to ensure that it’s safe to run. Tor is also free, so anyone can use it across a variety of platforms and devices.
In practice, accessing Tor can be as simple as downloading and running the Tor Browser, a custom-made version of Firefox, in which anything that happens in that browser window privately routes over the Tor network. Some advanced users may choose to route more of their internet traffic or data from specific apps over the Tor network.
The Tor Browser, maintained by the nonprofit Tor Project, also blocks and isolates ad trackers and prevents websites from “fingerprinting” your device, which can be used to uniquely identify and track which websites your specific device visits as you travel around the web.
With Tor, know its limitations. Because it’s designed with privacy and anti-surveillance in mind, it generally runs slower than the regular internet and is not designed for content streaming. Some governments and authorities try to block Tor traffic. Tor includes various in-built “bridges” that can disguise Tor’s traffic to make it blend in with regular internet traffic, making it more difficult for governments and authorities to block.
Back to top.
Geoblocking (or “geographical blocking”) can prevent you from accessing websites, video games locked to a specific geographical region, or online streaming services, such as watching a television program while you’re overseas.
This can be due to licensing restrictions on the content providers, or because some websites are unable to meet the legal obligations that some regional authorities require, such as in the European Union.
A VPN can help bypass geoblocking restrictions, but know the limitations.
Back to top.
VPNs were originally designed to allow users to “virtually” access their office network from anywhere else in the world. To this day, using a VPN to remotely access another computer or network is still a common and fairly typical use of a VPN.
If you work from home, you might use a VPN provided by your workplace for accessing your email or other web-based work applications when not in the office. It’s this secure private tunnel that lets you use a computer as if you were physically at the office. If you use a VPN for work, it will be provided to you — you won’t need to make one.
One possible use case for a VPN is so that you can access your home network from anywhere in the world. For most people, this is not necessary and could increase your risk of outsiders accessing your home network if your VPN were ever compromised.
And, developers might want to use a VPN to access another system that’s hosted in a data center, or use a VPN to connect systems together even if they are located in entirely different regions.
Back to top.
A VPN can be helpful in bypassing restrictions accessing content hosted in another region, known as geoblocking. Geoblocks can restrict access to certain online videos, games, or entire websites.
Using a VPN server that is hosted in a region where the content is located can sometimes allow access to the content as though you were physically located there. VPNs set up using modern infrastructure, like a data center or a cloud host, can usually handle a large amount of bandwidth and are unlikely to slow down your internet speeds or degrade the quality of your browsing, gaming, or content streaming.
It’s worth noting that some content providers are increasingly blocking access to devices that they cannot be sure are located in the region they claim to be, such as users they suspect are using a VPN. Some providers block the IP address ranges of some VPN providers altogether, rendering the VPN ineffective.
There is no guarantee that a VPN will work in every case. But the best VPN is one that you set up, as you can often set it up in the region of your choice and under your control.

If you have one or more systems that you want to be able to remotely access at any time, a VPN might be what you need. A VPN allows you to virtually access that system from anywhere in the world. That may be a system in a data center or a cloud host for storing your files, or a home computer at another property, or an office location that you own.
It’s worth noting that even with the most secure technology, no product, service, or software is free from security flaws. As such, setting up a VPN at home nevertheless increases the chance that it may be maliciously exploited by someone on the internet.
The best VPN is a VPN server that you set up so that you can configure and secure it, and control it yourself.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/ai-granny-scambaiter-wastes-telephone-fraudsters-time-with-boring-chat/,This 'AI Granny' hack wastes telephone scammers' time with boring chit-chat | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-11-15,"Telephone scams are nothing new, but with the advent of AI, it has become harder than ever for people to know whether the person they’re speaking to is in fact who they say they are. But U.K. mobile network O2 is turning the tables, creating what it calls an “AI granny” to keep scammers on the line for no good reason.
Daisy, as the bot is called, embraces “human-like rambling chat” to keep the scammers talking, with the express purpose of wasting their time with stories of family, knitting, and divulging entirely made-up personal information including bank details.
Made with help from YouTuber, software engineer, and renowned “scambaiter” Jim Browning, Daisy combines various AI models to listen and respond to calls. But it’s not something you’ll be able to use yourself (as fun as that would be) — for this exercise, O2 says it managed to get some of its own phone numbers added to lists commonly used by scammers.
Designed to mark International Fraud Awareness Week, the company says it has kept “numerous fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time.” After all, the more time scammers spend chatting with Daisy, the less time they have to spend calling real humans."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/drone-manufacturer-skydio-raises-170-million-extension-round/,Drone manufacturer Skydio raises $170 million extension round  | TechCrunch,"Margaux MacColl, Sean O'Kane",2024-11-15,"American drone manufacturer Skydio has raised an extension round of $170 million, adding to the $230 million Series E it closed early last year.
The new tranche of funding brings in strategic investors like Japanese telecom operator KDDI and Axon, the creator of the taser and other police tech. It also includes previous investors, like Linse Capital, which owns more than 21% of the drone maker.
The new funding comes at a time when defense tech funding is booming, with deals in the sector receiving over $9.1 billion in the first half of 2024, according to PitchBook.
“Frankly, no-brainer for us to invest in,” said Linse Capital managing director Bastiaan Janmaat. “Because we’re getting in at the same valuation, even though the business has doubled.”
TechCrunch viewed a pitch deck prepared this summer by Linse Capital for a potential Series F round, which showed the investor eyeing a $200 million to $300 million raise at the Series E’s $2.2 billion valuation. Janmaat told TechCrunch that Skydio opted instead to do an extension of the Series E. “We were of the opinion, ‘hey, go raise a big Series F now,’ and that’s what we initially pitched our LPs,” Janmaat said. “But, you know, we can’t make Skydio do that.”
Janmaat said the extension round was kickstarted by KDDI’s interest. KDDI ultimately invested about $60 million into Skydio and plans to place drones at 1,000 places throughout Japan, as well as helping Skydio with LTE connectivity for the drones there.
The Linse pitch deck also shows how Skydio is trying to diversify its revenue and reach profitability. Last year, the startup had over $100 million in annual revenue, the presentation shows. Thirty percent of that came from software. Skydio also reported a 38.1% gross margin in 2023, “driven by favorable mix shift towards software revenue and economies of scale in production costs,” according to the deck.
The company has gained significant traction with enterprise and public safety customers, especially since it officially sunset its consumer drone product in 2023. In 2024, Linse Capital projected Skydio would generate around $180 million in revenue despite the shift, according to the deck.
Things are also looking up for Skydio’s military ambitions: Of the $1.2 billion bookings in the pipeline, over 50% was ordered by defense customers.
In addition to winning contracts with law enforcement agencies across the country, Skydio has had help from one its investors: Earlier this month, TechCrunch reported that Andreessen Horowitz partner Ben Horowitz, who invested in Skydio, donated money to help the Las Vegas Police Department purchase Skydio drones. The approach, which allowed Skydio to bypass typical procurement and bidding processes, raised red flags with advocacy groups.
But Janmaat told TechCrunch he believes donating police tech is a smart approach, assuming the technology is worthy of police use.
“At the end of the day, these police departments, they’re not getting crappy technologies shoved down their throat,” he said. “They’re getting incredible technology at their fingertips sooner than they might otherwise.”
Even with the massive extension round and landing law enforcement contracts, Skydio, like many hardware startups, is set to spend lots of capital quickly.
The pitch deck details how Skydio has predicted it would burn through $238 million by 2029. Linse Capital, meanwhile, modeled the spending at about $350 million in the same time period. Janmaat told TechCrunch that Linse has encouraged Skydio to “be aggressive,” and burn through more capital by adding more products faster, given the lack of competition in North America. A Skydio representative said these burn rates are not in any of the company’s own pitch decks and that the startup cannot validate them.
But the figures Linse prepared ultimately present a more bearish look at the next five years than Skydio’s own projections. “That’s our job as investors, to be a bit more conservative,” Janmaat said.
Skydio’s future is very much still dependent on hardware releases, as well as convincing law enforcement and utility companies to purchase Skydio drones over competitors like Brinc and Chinese drone manufacturer DJI.
Increased scrutiny over Chinese drones at the state and federal levels could provide “tailwinds,” according to the pitch deck, helping Skydio increase domestic sales. But Skydio also faces that problem in reverse: Just last month, China sanctioned Skydio for selling drones to Taiwan, which has affected the drone-maker’s battery supply.
Does Janmaat think that was really just because they were working with Taiwan, or punishment for lobbying against DJI?
“Oh, it’s both,” he said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/after-raising-nearly-half-a-billion-dollars-abl-space-pivots-from-launch-vehicles-to-missiles/,"After raising nearly half a billion dollars, ABL Space pivots from launch vehicles to missiles | TechCrunch",Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-11-15,"Significant changes are coming to ABL Space Systems. The leader of the 7-year-old startup took to social media last night to make a big announcement: The company will no longer be focusing on the commercial launch market but will be turning instead to missile defense.
ABL had been developing a small launch vehicle called RS1 and a mobile ground system designed to fit inside a shipping container, with aspirations to bring truly portable, responsive launch to the market for the first time. To that end, the startup invested substantial capital into developing tech in-house, including a novel rocket engine, and in infrastructure; they had three test sites, two factories, and a launch site across three different states.
This growth has come at a considerable cost: In total, ABL Space has raised $461 million, with over half of that coming in via a $372 million Series B round in 2021 that valued the company at $2.4 billion.
But the startup encountered difficulties actually getting RS1 off the ground. During the first flight test in January 2023, the rocket’s nine engines spontaneously shut down shortly after liftoff, leading to it falling back to Earth, hitting the launchpad and being destroyed on impact. Prior to the second flight campaign this past July, ABL said the rocket suffered a serious anomaly during preflight testing that led to a loss of the vehicle.
However, ABL founder and president Dan Piemont said in an announcement posted to X and LinkedIn that these failures “[advanced] our technology readiness.” Instead, he said that the reason the company decided to pivot was because of changes to the launch market. ABL did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for an interview.
“Over the past few years, we’ve seen our ability to make a meaningful impact in the launch industry diminish,” Piemont said. “To succeed in such a demanding effort as scaling up an orbital launch program, you need deep motivation around your mission and potential impact, from many stakeholders. As the launch market matured, those motivations thinned and our path to making a big contribution as a commercial launch company narrowed considerably.”
Concurrently, Piemont says the company realized that the U.S. is poorly equipped to respond to missile threats: “We recognized that ABL’s technology could help to solve these problems by offering new capabilities with more test ranges, more frequent flights, and more creative R&D. We became convinced that to address these needs, a company would need to be singularly focused on the mission, rather than approaching it merely as an additional line of business.”
He added that ABL sees “considerable opportunity” to apply its existing IP, including the RS1 rocket, toward this new mission.
Missile defense is a major area of investment for the U.S. Department of Defense: The department’s fiscal year 2025 budget allocates $13.5 billion for missile defense programs, like tactical missile interceptors and counter-missile technology. Even a fraction of that funding could make it worthwhile for ABL — that is, if it can crack the notoriously challenging government sales environment."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/microsoft-bets-a-carbon-removal-bake-off-will-help-offset-its-skyrocketing-ai-emissions/,Microsoft bets a carbon removal bake-off will help offset its skyrocketing AI emissions | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-15,"Microsoft is in a pickle: It has committed to being carbon negative by 2030, but its emissions have skyrocketed more than 40% since 2020, thanks in part to its booming AI business. The company has bought a bunch of renewable power, but some emissions, like air travel, have been impossible to eliminate. What’s a Big Tech firm to do?
One option is direct air capture (DAC), the process of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Microsoft has been a large investor in DAC, through both equity checks in startups and committing to buying carbon credits in advance. But DAC is still in its infancy, with startups taking many different approaches in an attempt to find the cheapest, most efficient path.
To speed things along, Microsoft announced today that, along with the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), it’s pre-purchasing 10,000 metric tons of carbon over 10 years from Deep Sky, a DAC project developer. Unlike other DAC projects, which focus on one technology, Deep Sky is hosting a bake-off of sorts, welcoming eight startups to its site in Alberta, Canada, to see which one can do it best.
The eight startups will all get space near a well into which they’ll inject the captured carbon dioxide. Power to run their operations will all come from the same source, too. The shared approach should make it easier for startups to focus on what they do best — remove carbon — and not have to worry about the rest. Deep Sky is procuring solar power through a third party, and it is handling permitting for carbon storage. (Finding suitable sites for storage is one of the limiting factors for any carbon removal and storage project.)
Deep Sky told Bloomberg that the project should be up and running by April and that Microsoft and RBC will start receiving carbon credits by June. By DAC standards, that’s a pretty quick timeline. It won’t be enough to avert adverse warming, but if Deep Sky can find a winner, it might help pull the climate out of its current nosedive."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/x-sues-to-block-california-anti-deepfakes-bill/,X sues to block California anti-deepfakes bill | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-15,"Per Bloomberg, X, Elon Musk’s social media company, has sued to block California law AB 2655, which requires large online platforms to remove or label AI deepfakes related to elections.
X argues that the law, also known as the “Defending Democracy from Deepfake Deception Act of 2024,” will lead to widespread censorship of political speech. “There is a long history of the strongest of First Amendment protections for speech critical of government officials and candidates for public office that includes tolerance for potentially false speech made in the context of such criticisms,” a complaint filed late Thursday in Sacramento federal court reads.
AB 2655 imposes other requirements on platforms that X finds onerous, including establishing channels to report political deepfakes and a mechanism to allow candidates and elected officials to seek injunctive relief if a platform isn’t complying with the act.
The suit comes weeks after a federal judge temporarily blocked a related California deepfakes law to ban deceptive campaign ads online."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/general-motors-slashes-another-1000-jobs-to-cut-costs/,"General Motors slashes another 1,000 jobs to cut costs | TechCrunch",Sean O'Kane,2024-11-15,"General Motors is laying off nearly 1,000 workers in the U.S. as part of a cost-cutting bid, just three months after cutting 1,000 software jobs.
The company told TechCrunch that cuts won’t affect hourly workers at any of its factories, but declined to specify which teams were affected. A significant majority of the layoffs were salaried employees.
“In order to win in this competitive market, we need to optimize for speed and excellence. This includes operating with efficiency, ensuring we have the right team structure, and focusing on our top priorities as a business,” the company said in a statement.
The cuts come at a time when GM and other automakers face the possibility of losing federal subsidies for their electric vehicles — a proposal that newly elected President Donald Trump has said he’s in favor of, and one that his donor-advisor Elon Musk supports. The automaker is trying to cut losses on its EV efforts by $2 billion to $4 billion in 2025."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/how-social-app-spill-plans-to-capitalize-on-the-exodus-from-x/,How social app Spill plans to capitalize on the exodus from X | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-11-15,"Social networking rivals continue to benefit from the user exodus from X. Spill, the social app founded by two former Twitter employees, released a statement claiming it has also seen a jump in users after the U.S. presidential election, following similar news by Bluesky, which gained more than 2 million users during that time.
The startup, backed by $2 million in seed funding from investors like Kapor Capital, Collide Capital, Kerry Washington, and others, has seen a 10x week-over-week increase in signups, according to Spill co-founder and CEO Alphonzo Terrell in a post on LinkedIn.
“This is the highest single week of growth since the platform launched in July of last year,” Terrell told TechCrunch on Thursday on the sidelines of the AfroTech Conference. “We’ve also seen a 4x increase in returning users, which is our highest since last summer,” he said.
In addition to Spill’s growth, Terrell shared that the startup is currently finishing up a seed round and is on track to cross $1 million in annualized revenue next year.
Spill’s increasing traction isn’t surprising: Social media users are fleeing X with complaints about misinformation and moderation issues. Many Black Twitter users, in particular, have become frustrated with the site (now called X) under Elon Musk and have started fleeing to Spill, believing it a “safer space” for the digital Black community.
To address this need, Terrell said his app focuses on not just bringing in new people, but making sure they come back repeatedly and invite their friends.
Since January, Terrell and his team have been working to make Spill more fun and keep users engaged. It has streamlined its user interface, added new feed options to see what is trending, improved content moderation, and added ways for commerce to exist on the platform by launching a Spill Shop. In June, the company launched its first game, Spades, which has been played more than 20,000 times, Terrell said.
At this week’s AfroTech Conference, Spill launched Groups, which will allow people to create sub-communities.
“Some of the funniest takes are in group chats with a more intimate group of friends,” Terrell said. “With Spill Groups, fandoms, community orgs, book clubs, and group chats can plug into what’s happening in global and local culture simultaneously.”
AfroTech has always been a special place for Terrell. Two years ago, Terrell arrived at the conference, freshly laid off from X, taking calls and coffee meetings to try and get the company off the ground. Last year at AfroTech, Spill was toasting a $2 million seed extension round with Dom Pérignon. A few months ago, the company said actress and Spill user Kerry Washington had come on as an investor.
“People are looking for ways to stay connected and find community,” Terrell said, citing a Bloomberg story that said since November 6, there has been a rise in hate speech and targeted harassment on social media.
News of Spill’s growth comes just ahead of X’s new agreement terms kicking in on Friday, which, among other things, lets the platform train AI models on users’ posts and forces lawsuits with X to be litigated in a northern Texas court, favorable to Musk. High-profile names have already started to leave the platform because of these issues, including former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who said the litigation issue could shield X and punish its critics.
“The [X agreement] rule changes are just the latest in a series of actions taken by some legacy platforms that alienate both users and businesses that drive online culture,” Terrell agreed.
Spill has been downloaded more than 500,000 the company told TechCrunch, and Terrell is excited about the future. “Spill is a product specifically designed for this moment and we’re excited to put it into the hands of communities looking for a safer, more rewarding, more enjoyable way to connect virtually.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/as-bluesky-surges-threads-begins-testing-custom-feeds/,"As Bluesky surges, Threads begins testing custom feeds | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-11-15,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday announced the company’s X competitor, Threads, would begin testing custom feeds for specific topics and profiles, making it easier for users to find communities and conversations that interest them. The news follows the rapid growth of the social networking startup and X rival, Bluesky, which prioritizes tools that allow people to build their own algorithms and feeds, create lists, set their own moderation rules, and more.
Bluesky’s adoption has been picking up after the U.S. presidential election, as X gained a more right-wing focus and X owner Elon Musk used the platform formerly known as Twitter to heavily campaign for Trump. As a result, a number of more left-leaning users have been moving to the X alternative Bluesky, which went from seeing around 700,000 new users added over a week to now 1 million new sign-ups in just 24 hours.
Likely wary of the potential in Bluesky’s momentum, Threads aims to cater to user demands for further personalization and customization.
Though Threads forces its “For You” algorithmic feed on users by default, the new feature will allow users to create feeds of their own, which they can use to follow specific individuals or topics.
To create a custom feed, you’ll first need to search for and then tap into a topic to see the latest posts. From there, you’ll tap on the three-dot icon next to the search term and choose the option “create new feed.” You can also choose to add specific user profiles to a feed by visiting the user’s profile, tapping the three-dot icon above their profile photo, and then tapping to add them to one of your feeds.
Not all Threads users have access to custom feeds as of yet, as Threads says the company is only beginning to test the feature.
If you are in the test group, you’ll be able to view your custom feeds by pulling down on the home screen, which will reveal the existing Following and For You feeds, along with any other custom feeds you’ve created so you can toggle between them.
Though custom feeds have been a top request from the Threads community, this method keeps them somewhat hidden in the user interface. People were already frustrated that Threads’ “For You” feed on election night was displaying stale content instead of real-time news, seemingly not even realizing that a Following feed was an option to them — an indication that Threads’ current user interface makes it more challenging to discover and switch between different feeds.
Whether or not Threads’ adoption of custom feeds will help to stem the rush of new users to Bluesky remains to be seen.
Meta’s Threads is still the largest X competitor, with now north of 275 million monthly active users, including the 15 million more sign-ups it saw in November alone."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/jobget-a-linkedin-for-hourly-workers-acquires-rival-snagajob/,"JobGet, a 'LinkedIn' for hourly workers, acquires rival Snagajob | TechCrunch",Ingrid Lunden,2024-11-15,"If you’re an hourly worker, the number of go-to options you have for finding new jobs is shrinking a little. JobGet, a Boston-based startup that operates an hourly job-hunting site with social features built in, à la LinkedIn, is acquiring Snagajob, one of its rivals in the U.S. market.
JobGet claims this will make it the largest job platform targeting hourly and frontline workers in the U.S., covering 100 million people.
But to be clear, that’s not its user base — JobGet does not disclose how many active users it has, except to say that it is working with tens of thousands of customers and has helped secure millions of jobs. Snagajob says it has 3.6 million monthly active users and has filled 40,000 jobs at 14,000 employers.
The financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed. But for context, JobGet was last valued at $440 million when it raised $52 million in 2022, per PitchBook. The database notes that JobGet also raised an undisclosed amount this month from Flow Capital, although JobGet disputes this. Flow and JobGet were already acquainted: In June of this year, JobGet acquired a recruiting software provider in Flow’s portfolio called Wirkn, also for an undisclosed sum.
The picture is a little cloudier for Snagajob. The company has been around for 25 years (yes, dating to the first dot-com boom), and had raised a whopping $387 million in total from investors that include StarVest and Rho Ventures. But its last valuation of $178 million on PitchBook dates from a decade back, so it’s not clear how that relates to its worth today.
As for why it has now sold up to JobGet, it’s likely a part of the inevitable consolidation in the space.
In the last several years, we’ve seen a flurry of activity among tech companies building social, recruitment, and management tools targeting hourly workers.
Both Microsoft Teams and Meta’s now-defunct Workplace have been pitched as tools for waged workers, partly to differentiate themselves from Slack. Dozens of startups, including JobGet, have launched and raised tens of millions of dollars to target the frontline, waged, and hourly worker opportunity. Recent examples include $28 million for TeamBridge, $8.5 million for Bandana, $85 million for Fountain, and $175 million for Wagestream.
That spells an overcrowded — and probably over-capitalized — market, especially at a time when suddenly the whole game may be changing with AI. Also, funding for later-stage startups is just not as robust as it used to be.
That means more companies are combining to get better scale around the technology they are investing in.
JobGet, in keeping with the LinkedIn analogy, has social mechanics, describing itself as built “for the needs of the TikTok generation.” One of its features is “JobGenie,” which it likens to a “For You” page that uses AI and other tools to personalize job recommendations for users. It also has built instant interview scheduling and other features to cut down the time between discovering an opening and securing a new position.
“With access to the resources on JobGet’s platform, Snagajob’s job seekers and employers will continue to have a best-in-class experience and make meaningful employment connections,” said Keith Forshew, CEO of Snagajob. Notably, Snagajob’s users seem to fit well with JobGet’s TikTok remit — its trending searches include a number of jobs for teenagers.
“JobGet was founded to address a real, urgent need: the challenge that everyday workers face in finding jobs and that employers face in finding quality candidates,” said Tony Liu, founder and CEO of JobGet, in a statement. “With Snagajob as part of our platform, we are furthering our mission to create accessible pathways to employment for everyday workers while empowering employers to connect with quality candidates instantly and efficiently.”"

The company was announcing the launch of a new hair care line and Meghan told the outlet that she was “proud to invest in her as a friend and as a female founder.”
More and more news has been spreading about Meghan’s growing investment portfolio. In August, she spoke to The New York Times about her investment in the basket bag company Cesta Collective and said there were “between five and 10 brands” in her portfolio. Her first investment was the instant vegan latte company Clevr Blends back in 2020.
The tabloids also caught her at the G9 Summer Summit this year, which is put on annually by the firm’s founder, Amy Griffin. Her own company, American Riviera Orchard, is expected to launch soon.
“Investing in them has helped me line up for this chapter where I’m investing in myself,” Meghan told The New York Times, adding that she sees her investment strategy as a “dolphin tank,” rather than a “Shark Tank.”
“These are friendly waters,” she said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/gms-cruise-to-pay-500000-fine-to-doj-admits-submitting-false-report/,"GM's Cruise to pay $500,000 fine to DOJ, admits submitting false report | TechCrunch",Rebecca Bellan,2024-11-15,"Cruise, the autonomous vehicle unit of General Motors, has admitted to submitting a false report with the goal of influencing a federal investigation into a safety incident last year. In penance, the company will pay a $500,000 criminal fine as part of a deferred prosecution agreement, per the Department of Justice (DOJ).
This is one of several state and federal fines Cruise has been hit with after omitting crucial information related to that October incident, during which a Cruise robotaxi ran over a pedestrian who had been flung into its path after being hit by a human-driven car. The autonomous vehicle then proceeded to drag the pedestrian some 20 feet in an attempt to pull over, information that Cruise did not immediately share with regulators.
In June, Cruise agreed to pay $112,500 to the California Public Utilities Commission to avoid litigation and bring the dispute “to a close.” Three months later, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) slapped Cruise with a $1.5 million penalty.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating the incident.
As part of its agreement with the DOJ, Cruise must work with government investigations, implement a safety compliance program, and provide the U.S. Attorney’s Office with annual reports on implementation and remediation.
“Cruise will comply with the requirements set forth in the agreement, as we continue to move forward under new leadership and with a firm commitment to transparency with our regulators,” Craig Glidden, president and chief administrative officer at Cruise, said in a statement.
If Cruise fails to meet its obligations during the three-year agreement period, the government can proceed with prosecution of the charged offense.
“Today’s deferred prosecution agreement holds Cruise and its employees accountable for their lack of candor in a federal regulatory compliance action,” Cory LeGars, special agent-in-charge at a U.S. Department of Transportation oversight agency, said in a statement.
Cruise has taken many hits — financial and otherwise — since the incident. Cruise lost its permits to operate commercially in California and grounded its fleet around the country. Parent company General Motors slashed Cruise expenditures and took a firmer hand in controlling the company, which included a 24% layoff of its workforce and the departures of top leadership, including co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt.
And while Cruise resolved its investigation into this incident with NHTSA, the agency is still investigating whether Cruise’s robotaxis deal with pedestrians safely enough. In August, Cruise recalled nearly 1,200 robotaxis to resolve an issue with unexpected braking.
Still, Cruise continues trying to make a comeback. The company relaunched supervised autonomous driving in the Bay Area, Dallas, and Phoenix, and has a deal with Uber to bring Cruise robotaxis to the ride-hail app in 2025.
This article has been updated to include a statement from Cruise."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/angel-investor-hannah-bronfman-is-ready-to-launch-her-own-fund/,Angel investor Hannah Bronfman is ready to launch her own fund | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-11-15,"Early Thursday morning, excited AfroTech attendees shuffled into a conference room to see one thing: Hannah Bronfman, a noted angel investor who has more than 1 million followers on social media, in conversation with Blavity founder and CEO Morgan DeBaun.
Bronfman is a wellness content creator, an author, and an investor in more than 70 companies, including the beauty brands Topicals and Sienna Naturals. She is best known for founding the health, beauty, and fitness marketplace HBFIT, which closed last year after eight years in business.
She told the audience at AfroTech that she learned a lot during her time as a founder; she shared her journey and the insights that she learned along the way. For example, she learned how to handle co-founder fallouts, which is what led to the closing of HBFIT. She spoke about the importance of community and urged the audience to always lean on their networks — whether for advice or simply to connect.
Leaning on her network is how she found herself advising and mentoring founders, which led to writing angel checks to their companies. Soon she started growing an investment empire, both from angel investing as well as from receiving equity in brands she would work with as a content creator. The audience at this AfroTech panel, filled with young Black professionals and only open to VIP all-access, media, and top executives, was interested to learn more. Fewer than 5% of investors are Black and the industry still comes across as opaque, even as efforts continue to make it more transparent and accessible for the next generation.
Bronfman and DeBaun spoke about that, too, telling the room that more people could be investors if they wanted to. An increase in Black investor representation will lead to at least the identification of more successful Black founders, experts say. This is one reason Bronfman decided to focus her investment on overlooked founders who receive dismal and dwindling amounts of venture funding. The requirements to be an accredited investor are high, needing to make more than $200,000 or have a $1 million net worth. But the money wasn’t the issue for this particular audience, filled with corporate execs working in Big Tech. What they needed was guidance — a starting point.
She told them to start having conversations with people in their network, noting that many people around them are probably investors but just haven’t included them in any deals. “Only feel comfortable investing the amount you are comfortable losing,” she told the audience.
Bronfman also provides a network, mentoring, and a more hands-on relationship than an institutional investor would. She doesn’t mind cold emails, and is a fan of casual conversations that aren’t always focused on money.
“There is a lot of strength in reaching out to someone and saying, ‘Hey, your career is something I’ve admired, and I’d really love the opportunity to talk to you,’” she said.
Meanwhile, she is looking to become a little bit more than an angel investor in the future: She says she’s ready to become an institutional investor.
For the past few years, she had been raising special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to get in on larger check rounds, which is how she was able to back the now-unicorn Kindbody and the emergency contraceptive company Julie. She’s pondered for some time about launching her own fund, but said it wasn’t until she saw the backlash to P&G’s acquisition of the Black-owned hair brand Mielle, where consumers accused the Black founders of selling out to a white company, that Bronfman was ready to take the next step.
“We don’t have any holding [companies] for the culture,” she said, meaning there are essentially no Black-owned conglomerates for Black brands to exit to. “Where is our Black LVMH?”
Her goal is to one day build that. But first, she says she’s going to look at raising a fund, perhaps focused on Series A, with the goal to write checks for $1 million to $3 million. “And maybe one day I’ll get to that holding company.”"

But how much should Google pay for article previews? That’s what Google is trying to find out with an experiment in nine EU countries.
During the test, 1% of users won’t see articles from EU-based news publishers in search and Google News so that Google can see its real impact on traffic. Or at least that was the plan. While the company notified press publishers and associations in advance, the plan doesn’t seem well-thought-out.
Just a day after Google made its plan public, the Paris Commercial Court issued an order saying it was breaking its existing agreement with the French Competition Authority. Google could either scrap the test or pay €900,000 per day. The company decided to remove France from the list.
So now we’re down to eight countries for this 1% experiment — for now…

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/musks-amended-lawsuit-against-openai-names-microsoft-as-defendant/,Musk's amended lawsuit against OpenAI names Microsoft as defendant | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-15,"Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI accusing the company of abandoning its nonprofit mission was withdrawn in July, only to be revived in August. Now, in an amended complaint, the suit names new defendants, including Microsoft, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and former OpenAI board member and Microsoft VP Dee Templeton.
The amended filing also adds new plaintiffs: Neuralink exec and ex-OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis and Musk’s AI company, xAI.
Musk was one of the original founders of OpenAI, which was meant to research and develop AI for the benefit of humanity, and was originally established as a nonprofit. He left the company in 2018 after disagreements about its direction.
Musk has argued in previous suits that he’s been defrauded out of more than $44 million he says he donated to OpenAI by preying on his “well-known concerns about the existential harms” of the technology. He’s also accused OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman of “rampant self-dealing” between OpenAI and other companies in which Altman’s involved — to Altman’s personal gain.
In the newly filed complaint, lawyers for Musk argue OpenAI is now “actively trying to eliminate competitors” like xAI by “extracting promises from investors not to fund them.” It’s also allegedly unfairly benefiting from Microsoft’s infrastructure and expertise in what Musk’s counsel describes in the filing as a “de facto merger.”
“xAI has been harmed by, without limitation … an inability to obtain compute from Microsoft on terms anywhere near as favorable as OpenAI receives … and the exclusive exchange between OpenAI and Microsoft of competitively sensitive information,” reads the complaint, filed late Thursday in federal court in Oakland, California.
Microsoft, which first invested in OpenAI in 2019, ramped up the partnership last year, investing $13 billion in exchange for what’s effectively a 49% stake in OpenAI’s earnings. OpenAI also makes extensive use of Microsoft’s cloud hardware resources, using them to train, fine-tune, and run AI models like those that power ChatGPT.
Hoffman’s position on the boards of both Microsoft and OpenAI while also a partner at investment firm Greylock gave Hoffman a privileged — and illicit — view into the companies’ dealings, the complaint alleges. (Hoffman stepped down from OpenAI’s board in 2023.) Greylock invested in Inflection, Musk’s counsel notes, the AI startup that Microsoft acqui-hired earlier this year — and that could reasonably be considered an OpenAI competitor, according to the complaint.
As for Templeton, whom Microsoft briefly appointed as a nonvoting board observer at OpenAI, the amended filing alleges that she was in a position to facilitate agreements between Microsoft and OpenAI that would violate antitrust rules.
“The purpose of the prohibition on interlocking directorates is to prevent sharing of competitively sensitive information in violation of antitrust laws and/or providing a forum for the coordination of other anticompetitive activity,” the complaint reads. “Allowing Templeton and Hoffman to serve as members of OpenAI’s … board undermined this purpose.”
The suit goes on to claim that OpenAI, with an approximately 70% share of the generative AI market, “constitut[es] a monopoly,” or at least an attempt to monopolize the market.
Alongside Microsoft, Hoffman, and Templeton, California attorney general Rob Bonta is named as a defendant in Musk’s complaint. Bloomberg reported this month that OpenAI is in talks with Bonta’s office over the process to change its corporate structure.
Per the amended complaint, Zilis, who stepped down from OpenAI’s board in 2023 after serving as a member for roughly four years, has standing as an “injured employee” under California Corporations Code. Zilis repeatedly raised concerns over OpenAI’s dealmaking internally that fell on deaf ears — concerns substantially similar to Musk’s, according to the complaint.
Zilis has close ties to Musk, having worked as a project director at Tesla from 2017 to 2019 in addition to directing Neuralink research. (Neuralink is Musk’s brain-computer interface venture.) She’s also the mother of three of Musk’s children, Techno Mechanicus and twins Strider and Azure.
The 107-page amended complaint includes the unusual detail that Altman proposed that OpenAI sell its own cryptocurrency in January 2018, before it ultimately decided to transition to a capped-profit structure.
“Heads up, spoke to some of the safety team and there were a lot of concerns about the ICO and possible unintended effects in the future,” Altman wrote in an email to Musk dated January 21, 2018, an exhibit filed with the amended complaint shows. An ICO, or initial coin offering, is an unregulated means by which funds are raised for cryptocurrency businesses. “Going to emphasize the need to keep this confidential, but I think it’s really important we get buy-in and give people the chance to weigh in early.”
Musk supposedly shot down the crypto sale idea. “I have considered the ICO approach and will not support it,” he wrote in an email reply (shown as an exhibit) to Altman and OpenAI co-founders Greg Brockman (now OpenAI’s president) and Ilya Sutskever (OpenAI’s ex-chief scientist). “In my opinion, that would simply result in a massive loss of credibility for OpenAI and everyone associated with the ICO.”
The thrust of the lawsuit remains the same on the plaintiffs’ side: that OpenAI profited from Musk’s early involvement in the company yet reneged on its nonprofit pledge to make the fruits of its AI research available to all. “No amount of clever drafting nor surfeit of creative dealmaking can obscure what is happening here,” reads the complaint. “OpenAI, Inc., co-founded by Musk as an independent charity committed to safety and transparency … [is] fast becoming a full for-profit subsidiary of Microsoft.”
OpenAI has sought to dismiss Musk’s lawsuit, calling it “blusterous” and baseless."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/bluesky-says-1-million-people-signed-up-for-the-platform-in-last-24-hours/,Bluesky says 1 million people signed up for the platform in last 24 hours | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-15,"Bluesky said Thursday evening that over 1 million people signed up for the platform in the last 24 hours, making it one of the busiest days for the company. This also meant the social network crossed the mark of 16 million users overall.
The platform’s announcement comes hours after Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that Threads had seen more than 15 million sign-ups in November. He added that the Meta-owned platform has had 1 million sign-ups a day for the last three months.
Bluesky also faced some teething issues Thursday as service went down for some users, because one of the company’s ISPs had a cable issue that got clubbed with other networking snafus, according to a Bluesky developer.
The decentralized social network has seen a steady inflow of users in the last few months with different events like X’s ban in Brazil, moderation issues on Threads, and the recent election results in the U.S. X owner Elon Musk was a prominent supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, and the social networking service (formerly known as Twitter) often promoted pro-Trump viewpoints in users’ algorithmic feeds. After the results of the U.S. presidential election, more than a million new people signed up on the platform in a week, Bluesky said Tuesday.
At the time of writing, the sign-up surge on Bluesky in the last 24 hours also placed the app at the top of the free apps chart on the App Store in the U.S., followed by ChatGPT and Threads.
Bluesky is still much smaller overall than Threads, which has over 275 million active users, and X. However, the platform’s CEO Jay Graber posted earlier this week that Bluesky has a higher engagement than X.
“We also have a higher percentage of posters than most social sites, which follow a 90-9-1 pattern of lurkers-commenters-posters. We haven’t dipped below ~30% posters,” she said in a separate post.
Last month, Bluesky said it raised $15 million in Series A funding led by Blockchain Capital with participation from Alumni Ventures, True Ventures, SevenX, DarkMode’s Amir Shevat, and Kubernetes co-creator Joe Beda. On the product front, the company said it planned to launch subscriptions."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/heroku-ceo-bob-wise-departs/,Heroku CEO Bob Wise departs | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-15,"Bob Wise, the CEO of Heroku, Salesforce’s cloud platform as a service (PaaS), has left. A Salesforce spokesperson confirmed the news to TechCrunch in a statement via email.
“Bob Wise has left Salesforce for his next career move,” the spokesperson said. “We appreciate all that Bob has done for Salesforce and Heroku and we wish him well.”
Bob Wise joined Heroku as GM from Amazon Web Services, where he was Kubernetes GM and head of the open source program office. Wise was promoted to CEO of Heroku in 2023, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Wise’s rise to CEO came over a decade after Salesforce acquired Heroku for $212 million in cash. The platform allows programmers to build, run, and scale apps across a number of programming languages, including Java, PHP, and Go.
On its website, Heroku claims that it’s been used to develop more than 13 million apps to date.
Under Salesforce’s — and Wise’s — management, Heroku has faced a number of setbacks, including a security breach where attackers were able to obtain an access token for a Heroku account that was used for automation purposes.
In August 2022, Heroku announced that its free plans would be discontinued, citing fraud and abuse as reasons for the change. Some users weren’t pleased, understandably — and made their opinions known on social media.
“Our product, engineering, and security teams are spending an extraordinary amount of effort to manage fraud and abuse of the Heroku free product plans,” Wise said in a blog post at the time. “We will continue to provide low-cost solutions for compute and data resources.”
Competition in the PaaS sector has grown fiercer in recent years, with companies like Porter, Railway, Render, Fly.io, and Clever Cloud vying for a slice of Heroku’s business with compelling capabilities and tooling. Wise made efforts to engage with the developer community, posting a public roadmap of Heroku’s features and soliciting suggestions for improvements.
His departure is certain to have an impact on Heroku’s efforts to claw back market share. Salesforce has yet to announce plans for a replacement.
Relatedly, Heroku is still without a CPO after its previous CPO, Andy Fawcett, moved back to the U.K. to assume the role of VP of developer relations."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/tech-leaders-recommend-colleagues-for-trumps-cabinet/,Tech leaders recommend colleagues for Trump’s cabinet | TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,2024-11-14,"Tech executives have been trying to influence the incoming Trump administration to appoint Silicon Valley insiders for cabinet positions, The New York Times reported.
Given Elon Musk’s strong relationship with Donald Trump, many of these persuasion efforts have been directed towards him, including by friends of Musk like Joe Lonsdale, the co-founder of Palantir and venture firm 8VC, who has reportedly proposed some ideas.
Tech leaders have also reportedly floated Emil Michael, ex-Uber COO, to head the Department of Transportation. Before joining Uber in 2011, Michael was a White House fellow in the Obama administration and a special assistant to Robert Gates at the Department of Defense. Michael was reportedly forced out of Uber in 2017, shortly before Uber’s founder Travis Kalanick was pushed to resign from the company.
Jim O’Neill, a longtime associate of Peter Thiel, was meanwhile suggested to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, said the Times, though Trump chose vaccine-skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
O’Neill’s name has come up before, notes the outlet. He was recommended to head the FDA during Trump’s first administration; at the time, he was working for Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management."

According to Financial Times, the agency is looking into allegations that Microsoft imposed punitive licensing agreements to prevent customers from moving data off its platforms. Sources told FT that the FTC is also investigating claims Microsoft hiked subscription fees for customers who wanted to leave, made its products incompatible with rivals, and charged steep exit fees.
Last year, the FTC sought public comment on major cloud providers’ business practices. Most commenters highlighted restrictive software licensing, minimum spend contracts, and high data transfer fees as areas of anticompetitive concern.
It’s unclear how far the FTC’s investigation will progress. FTC chair Lina Khan’s tenure may end with the start of Donald Trump’s presidency, and Trump is generally perceived as on the side of deregulation."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/sam-altman-and-arianna-huffingtons-thrive-ai-health-assistant-has-a-bare-bones-demo/,Sam Altman and Arianna Huffington's Thrive AI Health assistant has a bare-bones demo | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-14,"In a splashy op-ed in Time published this summer, Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced Thrive AI Health, a venture with the goal of building an AI-powered assistant to promote healthier lifestyles. Backed by Huffington’s mental wellness firm Thrive Global and the OpenAI Startup Fund, Thrive AI Health would seek to build an “AI health coach” to give personalized advice on sleep, food, fitness, stress management, and “connection,” Huffington and Altman wrote.
Months later, Thrive AI Health’s assistant appears to be very much a work in progress.
TechCrunch discovered a demo of a minimum viable version of Thrive AI Health’s product on the company’s official website. Though largely nonfunctional, the demo has a working UI similar to chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It suggests prompts like “Can you analyze my sleep patterns?” and “What were my [sic] heart rate over the last week?,” and offers fields for personal health information like age, weight, and pre-existing conditions.
“Start exploring our features to track your health journey, log your activities, and get personalized insights,” a welcome message reads. “We’re here to help you thrive every step of the way!”
Thrive AI Health has been unusually quiet since its unveiling four months ago. The company’s CEO, DeCarlos Love, hasn’t posted on X since July. And besides launching a sign-up for a beta program, Thrive AI Health has kept press engagements to a minimum.
A press release in October mentions that subscribers to Function Health, a premium personal health management platform, will be able to share their data with Thrive’s health coach for “hyper-personalized behavior change recommendations” and “real-time guidance tailored to their unique health patterns” if they wish.
According to LinkedIn, Thrive AI Health, which claims to be hiring on its website, has fewer than 10 employees.
As we noted in July, Thrive AI Health is the latest in a long string of tech industry efforts to create health-focused apps with AI-driven personalization. Many have run up against intractable business, technical, and regulatory hurdles. Altman and Huffington’s involvement lent weight to Thrive. But it’s also sure to increase scrutiny on it."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/how-to-use-bluesky-the-twitter-like-app-thats-taking-on-elon-musks-x/,"How to use Bluesky, the Twitter-like social app taking on Elon Musk's X | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-11-14,"Bluesky is continuing to blow up. The Twitter-like service and alternative to Elon Musk’s X, has now surpassed 16 million users after seeing rapid growth in the days following the U.S. presidential election. While many are leaving X over the service’s increasing right-wing leanings and Musk’s campaigning for Trump, others are unhappy with other changes Musk has made — like how blocks work or how their content on X will be used to train AI.
Despite those issues, X is still the leader in the space in terms of monthly active users, while Threads is quickly catching up. Meta announced on Thursday that Threads grew by over 15 million users in November alone, for instance. Earlier this month, Threads said it had 275 million monthly active users.
But if Threads is the Big Tech threat to X, Bluesky is the indie effort. It’s already bigger than Mastodon, another decentralized X competitor that now has 7.6 million users, less than a million of whom log in monthly. (The wider fediverse built on the ActivityPub protocol, however, has over 10.8 million users.)
If Bluesky’s growth continues, it may begin to affect X. According to analytics provider Similarweb, X has now seen the largest number of account deactivations since Musk acquired the company, previously known as Twitter.
The firm based its findings on the number of visits to the confirmation webpage that appears after users indicate they want to deactivate their X accounts.
On Wednesday, X saw more than 115,000 U.S. web visitors deactivating their accounts, Similarweb found — more than any other day during Musk’s tenure. Previously, the peak had been around 65,000 on December 15, 2023, after Musk had restored the account of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. (The tracking firm is not able to track the number of X users who deactivate their accounts via the X mobile app, indicating the true number is much higher.)
While on the surface Bluesky looks and feels a lot like X, its underpinnings are quite different.
The app offers a familiar feature set, including the ability to create and share short text posts that can include accompanying media like photos, videos, GIFs, and links. As on X, these posts can be liked, reposted, replied to, or shared via direct messages. There are also standard blocking and reporting tools, plus tools for muting threads, words, and hashtags. Users can send private messages to others, too, and create lists.
But Bluesky’s promise is that of a social network that puts its users in control. Designed to be decentralized, the company has begun offering federation, meaning anyone can host their own data. The idea is similar to the decentralized X alternative Mastodon but involves a different protocol (the AT protocol instead of ActivityPub). Unlike Mastodon, server choice on Bluesky won’t affect the content you see, the company explains.
To sign up for Bluesky, you can create a new account via the web at bsky.app or download the mobile app for iOS or Android. After creating your username and password and providing some basic information like your email and birthday, you can begin to interact with other Bluesky users and follow feeds of interest to find your community.
By default, Bluesky users will create usernames that end in Bluesky’s domain, bsky.social. But the AT Protocol powering the service lets you use your own domain name as your handle, if you choose.
The company is also offering a site that helps you find a custom domain to use for your handle, which helps generate revenue for its otherwise free social networking platform.
If you want to venture beyond the official Bluesky app, third-party apps are available like Skeets, Graysky, and those that also cross-post to other networks, like Croissant, Openvibe, and SoraSNS.
If you prefer a more TweetDeck (X Pro) or column-based type of interface, the web app Skyfeed is an option.
Users on Bluesky also have more control over their individual feeds and algorithms than on X and other X competitors, like Meta’s Threads. While Bluesky operates its own app and provides its own feeds, users can customize their experience further based on the feeds and accounts they follow.
Anyone can build their own feed, and there are over 40,000 to now choose from. That means if you don’t like the feeds Bluesky offers, you can search for others and follow them, or even build your own.
You can find new feeds to follow by clicking on the “Feeds” link in the left-side navigation bar on the web or by tapping the hashtag (#) button on the top-right of the Bluesky mobile app’s home screen. Here, you’ll find the feeds you already follow, like Bluesky’s Discover feed, and can search for or scroll through other popular feeds you might like to add.
Some popular feeds include those that let you track your Mutuals or the posts Popular With Friends; those focused on a topic, like Science, News, Art, or even something silly like Cat Pics; and those that help you find a particular community. In the latter group, there’s Blacksky, which is working to bring the Black Twitter community to Bluesky, plus groups for certain geographies, like Brazil and Japan, and many more.
Another fun feature to explore in Bluesky’s Settings is the set of options you can configure around the content you see in your Following Feed.
Here, you can decide if you want to see Replies, Reposts, Quote Posts, and other content in your feed by toggling these options on or off.
Another area where Bluesky shines is how it approaches the so-called “cold start” problem — that is, it addresses the issue where new users on a service don’t know who to follow. Instead of leaving it up to the users, Meta’s Threads jumpstarted its X competitor by tying its user accounts to Instagram, allowing it to quickly build Threads’ user base off of an Instagram user’s existing social graph.
Bluesky lacks that built-in advantage so it instead came up with a tool for creating “Starter Packs.”
These packs allow anyone to create a list of interesting accounts they recommend, similar to X’s Suggested User List. Other people can follow accounts individually from the Starter Pack or can follow everyone on the Starter Pack with a click.
For example, there’s a TechCrunch Starter Pack here.
A third-party site, Bluesky Directory, has also begun to organize the Starter Packs that others have created and track their adoption. Today, there are packs focused on politics, journalists, developers, technologists, academia, sports, AI, health, and various other fan groups and communities. As Bluesky grows, more will become available.
While there’s no official feature or service that allows you to easily import your followers or following from X, there are some third-party services that can help.
At present, the best option seems to be Sky Follower Bridge, a Chrome web extension that helps you identify, find, and follow the same users on Bluesky that you previously followed on X, or those who followed you.
After installing the extension, you’ll head to your X Following or Followers page, then click the toolbar icon to launch the Sky Follower Bridge. You’ll need to then authenticate with Bluesky by entering your username and password.
However, instead of using your main password, you can and should create an individual “app password” to log in. This can be done from Bluesky’s Settings (under Advanced).
Once authenticated, you’ll press the “Find Bluesky Users” button. The service will scan the page and detect those X users who are on Bluesky, something it determines by comparing factors like the display name, handle, and more, or by looking for their Bluesky handle in their X profile’s description.
When the utility first launched, you had to follow users one by one, but a more recent version of Sky Follower Bridge offers a handy “Follow All” button that saves a ton of time. The developer warns you that you may end up with false positives, though, because this sort of detection is not perfect.
Sky Follower Bridge is free to use and donation-supported.
It can also be used on your List members pages and block lists on X, we should note.
In addition, Bluesky introduces a different take on moderation. Moderation on X and Threads is centralized, meaning the company makes the final decision. But Bluesky lets users tackle moderation as they see fit. They can mute and block users, create or subscribe to mute and block lists, subscribe to independent moderation services, or even self-host their own data on their own server.
While X is dialing back the power of the block, Bluesky users can block individual users or subscribe to mute or block lists.
There’s not a central directory of block or mute lists, but lists a user has created are available on their profile under the Lists tab. From there, you can subscribe to any list that looks like a fit for you. This is also where you’ll find any customer feeds the user has built. If something is a mute/block list, it won’t offer the “Pin to Home” button that lets you set the list as one of your default feeds.
To find block lists of bad actors and others, a search for “block list” will usually turn up some posts from people who are sharing their favorites. The influx of former X users is currently making block lists of far-right and MAGA groups more popular for newcomers trying to escape Musk’s politics.
Developers and communities can also choose to create their own independent moderation services using Bluesky’s tooling called Ozone. Once these alternative moderation services are built, other Bluesky users can subscribe to them to extend moderation beyond Bluesky’s own set of options.
To seed the ecosystem, Bluesky funded a few efforts focused on building independent labeling (moderation) services. Users can subscribe to these services’ filters by visiting the labelers’ page and clicking the subscribe button.
For instance, the XBlock Screenshot Labeller will let you hide screenshots — including those from X if you really want a clean break from Musk’s app. News Detective is another labeler that aims to fact-check Bluesky posts through a community of volunteers. (Users who subscribe will be able to see explanations and sources, and be able to request checks on questionable posts.)
A larger list of labelers is here.
Most users become members of Bluesky’s community and server for now, which means Bluesky’s own Community Guidelines apply. However, the ability to self-host became available earlier in 2024, for developers and other technical users who’d prefer to run their own community and host their own data. To do so, you’ll need to be comfortable running a Personal Data Server (PDS) in a federated environment. (Digital Ocean and Vultr are popular cloud providers for those who want to self-host.)
You don’t have to get involved with self-hosting, building moderation services, or blocklists, if you’re not technically inclined. You can simply engage with the tools built by the community or the Bluesky team, which are found in the Bluesky app’s Settings. (Go to Settings > Moderation > Bluesky Moderation Service to configure your options.)
Gaining traction on Bluesky is not much different from other social networks, though, so far, the service’s vibe tends to favor more regular posters — or even sh**posters, who tend to be more exuberant, carefree, and uncensored.
Adult content is also permitted but can be labeled as such. Meanwhile, users get to control what level of NSFW content they’ll see by configuring their choices in the moderation settings. Here, they can also set how Bluesky should handle other types of sensitive or harmful content, like misinformation, scams, spam, extremist content, threats, intolerance, rude content, self-harm, impersonation, and much more, allowing people to build a feed they feel comfortable with. Plus, you can choose to “Hide,” “Warn,” or turn a filter off entirely, depending on your preferences.
This solution addresses an issue that has long plagued X: Everyone has different thresholds when it comes to the type of content they want to see in their feeds. Some prefer the uncensored firehose, however horrific it may be at times, while some want the opposite: heavy-handed moderation. Others want more control based over what type of content is displayed, hidden, or blocked.
After finding your community and preferred vibe, you should stop lurking and begin to interact. To generate engagement, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber suggests the following: “Post into some relevant feeds, comment on other people’s posts, find mutuals in feeds or elsewhere, use hashtags.”
Unlike Threads, which redesigned the way hashtags work (they’re links but don’t include the hash symbol itself), Bluesky embraced the traditional hashtag. That means you can search for topics, interests, or communities much like you do on X, like #Neuroscience or #BlackSky or #TechNews or anything else.
Bluesky does not yet have a trending topics page, like X and Threads, which may make it feel a bit less like a real-time information hub. But it doesn’t make it hard to escape its algorithmic feeds, if you prefer something else — like a feed that’s centered around political news or updates from media publishers, for instance. And while Threads is no longer recommending political content to users — an editorial decision many disagree with, including creators — Bluesky leaves that choice up to each end user.
To stay in touch with what’s new, users can also follow accounts or (unofficial) feeds focused on what’s trending, like Now Breezing, a bot that updates “on the :10s”, or Catch Up, which highlights the most popular posts from the last 24 hours."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/chinese-autonomous-driving-startup-pony-ai-seeks-up-to-224m-in-us-ipo/,Chinese autonomous driving startup Pony AI seeks up to $224M in US IPO | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-11-14,"Pony AI is inching closer to its initial public offering in the U.S., but as it does so, it continues to drop its minimum target for what it hopes to raise in the transaction.
Pony operates a fleet of 190 “robotrucks” in Beijing and Guangzhou and more than 250 robotaxis in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai. The company told TechCrunch it can charge for robotaxi fares in all four cities and is fully driverless in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.
In a filing Thursday, the Chinese self-driving technology company said it plans to issue 15 million American Depository Shares, with the possibility of issuing 2.25 million more if demand is high, at an expected price range of between $11 and $13 per share. At $13, that would value the company at $4.48 billion, based on 344.9 million shares outstanding immediately following the offering.
Pony once hit a valuation of $8.5 billion following the close of a Series D round in 2022, in which Toyota participated.
Based on the company’s expected share price range, Pony could expect to rake in up to $224 million from the transaction, which is well below its initial target of $425 million. But at a minimum, the company would collect $165 million, which is also well below the $200 million minimum set in September.
Pony’s debut is the latest in a string of Chinese companies going public on the U.S. stock market after a multi-year ban from Beijing on offshore capital raising. U.S. investors appear to have a growing appetite for Chinese technology companies, despite growing geopolitical tensions and a looming tariff on all Chinese imports.
In the automotive sector, Pony follows Chinese EV startup Zeekr, which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in May with $441 million in gross proceeds.
WeRide, another autonomous vehicle startup, debuted on the Nasdaq in October, raising $440.5 million in its IPO and private placement.
Pony will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker “PONY.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/bluesky-is-courting-the-swifties/,Bluesky is courting the Swifties | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-11-14,"Bluesky has grown by 2 million users — about 15% — since Donald Trump won the U.S. election last week. But the emerging social platform isn’t just acting as a refuge for left-leaning X users who are disappointed in Elon Musk’s alliance with the president-elect. A community of Taylor Swift fans, or Swifites, has also laid its foundation on the decentralized social app.
Almost 13,000 people on Bluesky have signed up with a “swifties.social” domain name, indicating their involvement in the Taylor Swift fan community. Other fandoms for artists like Beyoncé (about 900 members) and BTS (about 4,500 members) have also emerged.
These fan-driven domains, which function within the main Bluesky social server, came from a project that Bluesky developer Samuel Newman made in May 2023, before he was hired by the company. (Newman was also behind the third-party client Graysky before he got a job at Bluesky.) Newman’s tool allows anyone to claim subdomain handles from a domain that you own. For example, Newman bought “kawaii.social,” which now has about 450 members. Using his tool, we could technically snatch up “techcrunch.kawaii.social” as our domain, but alas, that might not be as consistent with our brand as our current “techcrunch.com” handle.
“It’s taken off in ways I didn’t expect. I originally made the tool thinking people might want a ‘bsky.london’ handle or something like that, but it turns out that the handle is a great signal for what kind of account you are, and stan accounts absolutely love being able to self-identify themselves like that,” Newman told TechCrunch via Bluesky DM.
The swifties.social domain didn’t see much growth at first, with about 2,000 users joining until August 2024, when X was temporarily banned in Brazil.
“Bluesky got an enormous influx of Brazilian users, including many Swifties,” Newman said. “The tool went viral, jumping to nearly 8,000 handles claimed. Then, after the election, yet another wave of Swifties arrived and the tool went viral again, jumping to 12,800!”
That wave of growth from Brazilian users was when Newman added handles for BTS fans (army.social) and Beyoncé fans (beyhive.social).
In the grand scheme of things, users with these fan domains only make up a tiny fraction of Bluesky’s 16 million users (and counting). But fan communities are often what makes a social network run; in the early 2010s, Tumblr boomed in part due to fandoms for TV shows like “Supernatural” and “Doctor Who,” as well as bands like One Direction. Even if a community is small, these cohorts tend to be very active social media users, and Bluesky thus far has prided itself on its ability to maintain highly engaged users.
“We … have a higher percentage of posters than most social sites, which follow a 90-9-1 pattern of lurkers-commenters-posters. We haven’t dipped below ~30% posters,” Bluesky CEO Jay Graber wrote in a post on Tuesday."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/the-7500-ev-tax-credit-is-on-trumps-chopping-block/,"The $7,500 EV tax credit is on Trump's chopping block | TechCrunch",Kirsten Korosec,2024-11-14,"Republicans have long opposed the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles contained in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Now, it seems President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team has made that a priority with plans to end the tax credit as part of broader tax reform legislation, Reuters reported citing two unnamed sources.
TechCrunch has confirmed the information with one source noting that the transition team appears “resolute on this.” Reports of the transition team’s intentions caused the stock price of Rivian, and other exposed automakers, to fall. Tesla shares fell 5%, and Rivian shares dropped by more than 12%. Despite the seeming risk for Tesla, the company’s CEO Elon Musk (who is also a Trump ally) has previously supported removing the subsidy. “Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,” Musk wrote in a July 2024 post on X, the social platform he owns.
It’s worth noting that killing the tax credit cannot be done with the wave of an executive order once Trump is in office. The so-called 30D Clean Vehicle Credit, which gives consumers a $7,500 tax credit for certain qualifying EVs, is part of the tax code. This means it must be approved by Congress.
The best chance to remove the tax credit would be to include it in the tax reform package that is expected to go to Congress in the spring. In the meantime, the Trump administration could use the Treasury Department, which would make it more difficult to attain the tax credit.
Of course, Republicans will have to evaluate some of the provisions established in the EV tax credit, which are designed to incentivize domestic manufacturing and to make the U.S. less reliant on exports from China. To qualify for the EV tax credit, vehicles must be assembled in the United States, and certain battery components and critical mineral sourcing requirements must also be met. For instance, the IRA mandates at least 50% of the value of certain critical minerals in an EV battery must be sourced and processed in the U.S. or a trade partner country. That requirement increases by 10% every year through 2027."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/ford-will-pay-up-to-165m-fine-for-rearview-camera-recall-failures/,Ford will pay up to $165M fine for rearview camera recall failures | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-11-14,"Ford has agreed to pay a $165 million penalty to federal regulators after moving too slowly to recall vehicles with faulty rearview cameras.
This is the second largest fine the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has handed out in its 54-year history, after the 2019 Takata airbag recalls.
Ford also failed to provide accurate and complete information in its reports to the NHTSA and to submit certain quarterly recall reports in a timely manner, according to the agency’s consent report.
Ford will ante up $65 million in the next couple of months, with $55 million “held in abeyance” subject to Ford’s adherence to the consent order terms. The automaker will spend the remaining $45 million on developing technology to improve safety, including advanced safety data analytics capabilities and a multimodal driver assistance technology test lab focused on low-voltage electronics, like rearview cameras.
The NHTSA’s remedies also require Ford to enlist an independent third party with expertise in motor vehicles and Safety Act requirements to ensure the automaker remains compliant with federal safety regulations.
“We appreciate the opportunity to resolve this matter with NHTSA and remain committed to continuously improving safety and compliance at Ford,” a Ford spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Wide-ranging enhancements are already underway with more to come, including advanced data analytics, a new in-house testing facility, among other capabilities.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/hawk-tuah-girl-launches-pookie-tool-an-ai-powered-dating-advice-app-and-its-fine/,"'Hawk Tuah' girl launches Pookie Tools, an AI-powered dating advice app, and it's fine? | TechCrunch",Lauren Forristal,2024-11-14,"Haliey Welch, the 22-year-old who went viral for her “Hawk Tuah” video, has managed to turn her brief moment of fame into a full-fledged career. In just a few months, Welch has rapidly risen to fame, amassing around 5 million followers across various social media platforms.
After recently releasing her own podcast titled “Talk Tuah,” she’s now venturing into the tech world with a new AI-powered dating advice app called Pookie Tools.
Launched on the App Store this week, Pookie Tools offers a range of features aimed at Gen Z singles, such as an AI chatbot to help with conversation starters and general dating advice, outfit recommendations for dates, tips to enhance your dating profile, and even a zodiac compatibility feature.
The app is launching at a time when many young daters have complaints about the current online dating culture, which is plagued by ghosting, scams, and other challenges. Some users have even turned to AI tools like ChatGPT for dating advice, using prompts to generate entire conversations. Major dating platforms Bumble and Tinder have also introduced AI tools.
While Welch is not the first content creator to launch an app, it’s rare for someone to do it so early in their career, which could signal creators are becoming anxious about the sustainability of their success. More established influencers, such as Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) and David Dobrik, have previously launched their own apps.
TechCrunch spoke (or, talked tuah) with Welch and discussed her new app, which is named after a cute nickname she calls her boyfriend.
“I [was on] Bill Maher’s podcast, and it was actually one of his ideas he gave me,” Welch said. “He kind of pushed me, in a way, saying I should be a relationship coach. And so we came up with the idea. … This app is the easiest way for them to find their forever Pookie.”
To build the app, Welch partnered with Ben Ganz, founder of Ultimate AI Studio, an AI customer support automation platform.
In theory, Welch’s app seems like a fun and promising concept tailored for those navigating the world of dating and relationships. It resembles other AI-driven relationship coaching tools, generating responses to all sorts of relationship questions, whether you’re seeking advice on communication, conflict resolution, or simply how to have an enjoyable date.
One standout feature is its ability to suggest creative date ideas based on your location and whether it’s your first date or your 10th time seeing the person. Additionally, the app offers outfit recommendations to help you dress appropriately for different dating scenarios, whether it’s a casual coffee date or an elegant dinner. It can also analyze your dating app profiles and provide feedback, such as engaging prompts or recommendations for adding more photos that show off your personality. Pookie’s “Flirt Meter” evaluates your text messages on a scale of 0 to 100 to determine their flirtatiousness.
When it was announced that the Hawk Tuah girl would be offering dating advice through a new app, we expected the chatbot to embody her signature humor and bluntness. However, upon testing Pookie Tools’ AI chatbot, it became apparent that the responses were generic and lacked the distinctive personality that we anticipated. As a result, it felt strikingly similar to ChatGPT and other existing AI tools.
According to Ganz, however, they’re working on training the model by using transcripts from the podcast.
Two of the tools may be considered controversial, however: “Bald Predictor” and “Height Detector.”
Bald Predictor works by analyzing a photo of a person searching for potential patterns of hair loss. Height Detector uses proportions and surroundings to estimate height.
Both of these AI tools appear to be a response to frustrations expressed by some women regarding men who misrepresent their height on dating profiles or disguise their hair loss in photos. Some women are already using ChatGPT to call out men for lying about their height.
However, the tools might come across as mean-spirited and could perpetuate the stigma that short and bald men are inferior.
Welch maintains that the tools are intended to be lighthearted. But she did mention that, as a 5’8” woman, her favorite tool is the height detector.
And, as with any AI technology, the Height Detector isn’t 100% accurate and only provides an estimated guess. Our testing yielded mixed results, but one ended up being just 2 inches off from the person’s real height, taking several things into consideration, like the countertops next to the person and the ceiling height. When we tested the Bald Predictor, the AI couldn’t determine the probability of baldness from some of the images.
Welch and Ganz plan to introduce new features in the future by collaborating with podcast guests and other content creators, although they did not specify which features will be added. Notable figures such as Holly Madison and Whitney Cummings have appeared on Talk Tuah, which may attract more users to the app.
Pookie Tools operates on a subscription model; it costs $7 per week or $50 per year. There’s also a three-day free trial."

The Rivian-Volkswagen Group joint venture has been officially finalized. Before the parties signed on the dotted line, it got about 16% bigger. The deal will now inject up to $5.8 billion into Rivian’s coffers with $1 billion already delivered via a convertible note.
We don’t know all of the specific terms, but it is worth noting that this will be an independent company co-led by Rivian’s head of software Wassym Bensaid and Volkswagen Group’s chief technical engineer, Carsten Helbing. The team, which will be heavily loaded with Rivian engineers, will be based in Palo Alto, California. It will eventually set up three more sites in North America and Europe.
A lingering question — and one asked by lots of media (including moi) during a press conference — is what happens to VW’s struggling software arm, Cariad? VW Group CEO Oliver Blume claims that Cariad will still play a “central role.” We’ll see.
Meanwhile, Rivian is still struggling with a supplier problem that curbed production and cut into revenue. In its Q3 earnings, Rivian reported $874 million of revenue, more than 34% lower than the same period last year. But looking at the gap between production (13,157) and deliveries (10,018) suggests that demand is also an issue.
That VW money is looking pretty sweet right now.
Other deals that got my attention …
Just Eat Takeaway, the Netherlands-based food delivery company, is selling its U.S. business Grubhub to New York-based Wonder Group in a deal valued at $650 million. That’s 91% less than the $7.3 billion Just Eat Takeaway paid for the company just four years ago.
Silicon Valley battery startup Lyten is acquiring manufacturing assets from Northvolt, the Swedish battery manufacturer that has struggled in recent months and is short on capital. The companies didn’t disclose financial terms but did say Northvolt will sell manufacturing equipment it inherited in its 2021 acquisition of Cuberg, another battery startup.
NASA gave out five research awards worth $11.5 million to companies working on sustainable aircraft concepts, including JetZero.
Vatn Systems, a Portsmouth, Rhode Island-based company developing underwater autonomous vessels, raised $13 million in a seed round led by DYNE Ventures and with participation from Lockheed Martin Ventures, RTX Ventures, In-Q-Tel, and others. The round brings the startup’s total funding to $16.5 million.
Vecna Robotics, a warehouse robotics startup that developed autonomous forklifts and other pallet movers, has raised $14.5 million. But the raise wasn’t exactly what got my attention; it was the appointment of Karl Iagnemma, the former president and CEO of Motional. Iagnemma has been in the AV world for a couple of decades now, largely in pursuit of commercializing autonomous vehicles (i.e., robotaxis). This new position puts him at the helm of a startup (in which he was an early investor, btw) that already has commercial customers.
Monarch Tractor, the autonomous electric tractor startup, has laid off workers as part of a restructuring that will see it prioritize non-agricultural customers, license its autonomous technology, and boost sales of its AI-powered farm management software. Got a tip about Monarch? Reach out to Sean O’Kane at sean.okane@techcrunch.com.
Yelp agreed to buy RepairPal, a site for car repair estimates, for $80 million in cash. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to customary closing conditions.
Waymo dropped its waitlist in Los Angeles, opening the robotaxi service up to the public. The service area is now about 80 square miles of Los Angeles County.
Welp, Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson told us at Disrupt 2024 that the Amazon-backed company’s custom robotaxi would be hitting the streets of San Francisco and Las Vegas. And now they have officially arrived. These are just for employees right now and will eventually be opened up to invited members of the public.
Canoo keeps trying to hold on, but its prospects don’t look great. The EV startup-turned-SPAC told shareholders in its Q3 earnings “it must continue to take aggressive actions to consolidate our operations, reduce costs, and catch-up to our plan.” As part of that plan, Canoo’s exec team, which includes chairman and CEO Tony Aquila and new CFO Kunal Bhalla, will take “short-term pay cuts for long-term incentives.” Reminder: Aquila’s firm has lent Canoo money, and among the terms is an 11% interest rate.
In other Canoo news, the company tested its electric vans for Walmart without airbags despite warnings from employees, sources told Fortune.
Lucid started taking orders for the Gravity SUV. If it wasn’t already clear, Lucid’s future hinges on the success of this EV.
Tesla issued a recall for more than 2,000 Cybertrucks, the sixth since the EV launched a year ago. And no, it’s not one that can be fixed by a software update. Speaking of Tesla, the automaker is part of the trillion-dollar club (market cap) again thanks in part to shareholders betting a Trump presidency will benefit the company led by ally Elon Musk.
Exosonic, a startup developing supersonic commercial air travel and UAV tech, said it is shutting down after failing to find the capital needed to continue operations.
This week, I’m back with a couple more Waymo robotaxi tales from TechCrunch staff members who had their first rides while in San Francisco for Disrupt 2024. As I mentioned last week, I’ve been in loads of autonomous vehicles, including driverless Waymos, so I thought it would be fun to share some first-timers’ views.
From UK-based reporter Paul Sawers: “While I’ve written about the autonomous vehicle industry for many years, taking my first ride in an actual self-driving car was pretty mind-blowing — it felt like I’d been catapulted into the future. I couldn’t help but stare at the empty driver’s seat and marvel at the fact that we were maneuvering through the streets of San Francisco. It wasn’t hugely nerve-wracking, but that’s probably because we weren’t going much faster than about 25 to 30 miles per hour. I suspect if I was on the highway in that thing, it might be a little more hairy.
More broadly, there was something a little jarring about seeing all these humanless cars creeping around street corners— marginally dystopian, like the machines were finally taking control.”
From reporter Rebecca Bellan: “I rode in as many Waymos as I could during the week of Disrupt, and it felt sort of like a ride at Disneyland. It moved slow and cautiously, and I wasn’t really worried about crashing. Most rides went without incident, barring one in which the robotaxi looked poised to drive towards a pedestrian but then thankfully swerved.
“My main gripe is that the vehicles often began to drive off before you reached them, likely due to a lack of access to city curbsides. I’m not sure how the ‘Driver’ decides it’s time to drive half a block up and wait there instead, but this little exercise had my editor Kirsten and I chasing one down a couple of blocks and a (thankfully well-lit) alleyway before we could come aboard.”
Senior reporter Sean O’Kane wrote: “I’ve covered AVs long enough that I expected my first taste of Waymo’s careful rollout to go super smoothly — and it did. I did not expect to feel so viscerally just how expensive these current vehicles are, from the whirring lidars to the high-price I-Paces. I’m excited to ride again someday soon, but I hope by then Waymo will have made more progress on making a viable business.”
What is “This week’s wheels”? It’s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we’re testing, whether it’s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike, or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/chatgpt-can-now-read-some-of-your-macs-desktop-apps/,ChatGPT can now read some of your Mac's desktop apps | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-11-14,"OpenAI’s ChatGPT is starting to work with other apps on your computer.
On Thursday, the startup announced the ChatGPT desktop app for macOS can now read code in a handful of developer-focused coding apps, such as VS Code, Xcode, TextEdit, Terminal, and iTerm2.
That means developers will no longer have to copy and paste their code into ChatGPT, which has become a common way to use the chatbot. Now when the feature is enabled, OpenAI will automatically send the section of code you’re working on through its chatbot as context, alongside your prompt.
However, unlike popular AI coding tools such as Cursor or GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT is currently unable to write code directly into developer apps on your behalf.
The feature, called Work with Apps, is far from an AI agent, but OpenAI says getting ChatGPT to understand other apps is a “key building block” toward building agentic systems. One of the biggest challenges facing AI agents today is getting them to understand the rest of your computer screen, as opposed to prompts or their own responses.
OpenAI says it’s focusing this feature on coding apps to start; this is likely because AI coding assistants have taken off as one of the most popular use cases for LLMs. The feature is available to Plus and Teams users today and will roll out to Enterprise and Edu in the next few weeks. OpenAI says ChatGPT will be able to work with other types of apps moving forward, specifically text-based apps that could be used for writing tasks.
In a demo with TechCrunch, an OpenAI employee opened the ChatGPT app and an Xcode environment containing a simple project modeling the solar system — although it was missing Earth. The employee selected an Xcode tab within ChatGPT, which tells the AI chatbot to look at the app, and prompted the chatbot to “add the missing planets.” The chatbot was able to complete the task, writing a line of code to represent Earth that matched the rest of the project’s format. They still had to paste ChatGPT’s answer back into their environment, though.
In order to read different apps, OpenAI is mostly relying on the macOS accessibility API to read text and translate it to ChatGPT, according to OpenAI desktop product lead Alexander Embiricos. The screen reader on macOS, which helps Apple’s VoiceOver feature work, has been around for nearly two decades. It’s generally considered pretty reliable for most common apps, but not everything.
For some apps, such as Microsoft’s VS Code, Work with Apps requires users to install a special extension to query content. And, as the name suggests, Apple’s screen reader can only read text, so it can’t help ChatGPT understand visual elements, such as photos, the orientation of objects, or videos.
Work with Apps will send your last 200 lines of code through ChatGPT alongside every prompt for certain apps. For others, all the code in your foremost window will be used as input for the chatbot. You can highlight sections of code or text to help ChatGPT focus on the right part of the project, but ChatGPT will also include text surrounding it. This all sounds like it will use a lot of input tokens.
It’s unclear how OpenAI plans to branch this feature out to other apps that are not compatible with Apple’s screen reader. Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s competitors, released an AI system that analyzes screenshots of a user’s desktop to understand and use other apps. To be frank, Anthropic’s approach leaves a lot to be desired in its current state. It’s slow and makes a lot of mistakes. However, it’s a more general-purpose version of an AI agent that doesn’t rely on APIs and can do more than just read text in another window.
“This isn’t meant to be an agent; it’s a way to collaborate with coding tools to start, and there will be more tools coming soon” said Embiricos in a briefing with TechCrunch. “On the side of agents, I think this is a really key building block. This idea that ChatGPT understands or can work with all the content that you have so that it can help with it.”
This step toward agents is especially notable given recent reports that OpenAI is nearing the release of a general-purpose AI agent, codenamed “Operator,” according to Bloomberg. The tool is expected to arrive in early 2025 and would rival other early attempts at general-purpose AI agents, such as Anthropic’s Computer use or Google’s reported “Jarvis” agent.
OpenAI is first releasing these features on macOS, shortly before Apple launches an integration with ChatGPT in December. It’s unclear when Work with Apps will come to Windows, the operating system created by OpenAI’s largest backer, Microsoft."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/youtube-chases-tiktok-with-new-gifting-feature-for-vertical-livestreams/,YouTube chases TikTok with new gifting feature for vertical livestreams | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-11-14,"YouTube is launching a new way for creators to earn money during vertical livestreams, the company announced on Thursday. Viewers can now buy “Jewels,” a digital currency, to send “gifts” to creators. Gifts are animations that appear on screen during vertical livestreams.
If this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s similar to TikTok’s live gifting feature that lets viewers purchase “coins” to send gifts, of various monetary value, to support live creators during their streams.
When viewers use Jewels to send gifts on YouTube, creators get “Rubies.” Creators receive 1 cent for each Ruby, which means creators get $1 for 100 Rubies. Since the price for Jewels on YouTube can vary based on different bundle options, there isn’t a fixed effective revenue share, which means the amount of Rubies earned can vary.
For the next three months, eligible creators can receive a 50% bonus on their gifts’ earnings, up to $1,000 per month, in addition to their regular earnings from Rubies.
Creators can only receive gifts when they stream vertically directly on YouTube or with third-party streaming software, and viewers can only send gifts through the mobile app.
Although YouTube has allowed viewers to support livestreamers through “Super Stickers” in the chat tab, this new feature is a direct response to the popularity of gifts on TikTok Lives.
Creators on TikTok are earning thousands of dollars by going live and then receiving gifts from viewers. For instance, some teens earned up to $7,000 a month by arguing for or against Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in live battles on the platform. Plus, numerous NPC streamers have earned thousands of dollars, per day in some cases, by receiving gifts during livestreams.
YouTube notes that once an eligible creator enables gifts on their vertical livestreams, they will no longer have access to Super Stickers. The Google-owned company says it believes gifts offer viewers a better way to visually support their favorite live creators.
The new monetization option is rolling out to eligible creators in the U.S. over the next few weeks."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/new-apple-security-feature-reboots-iphones-after-3-days-researchers-confirm/,"New Apple security feature reboots iPhones after 3 days, researchers confirm | TechCrunch",Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-11-14,"Apple’s new iPhone software comes with a novel security feature that reboots the phone if it’s not unlocked for 72 hours, according to security researchers.
Last week, 404 Media reported that law enforcement officers and forensic experts were concerned that some iPhones were rebooting themselves under mysterious circumstances, which made it harder for them to get access to the devices and extract data. Citing security researchers, 404 Media later reported that iOS 18 had a new “inactivity reboot” feature that forced the devices to restart.
Now we know exactly how long it takes for this feature to kick in.
On Wednesday, Jiska Classen, a researcher at the Hasso Plattner Institute and one of the first security experts to spot this new feature, published a video demonstrating the “inactivity reboot” feature. The video shows that an iPhone left alone without being unlocked reboots itself after 72 hours.
See the latest iOS inactivity reboot in action!iOS 18 comes with improved anti-theft measures. Three days w/o unlock, the iPhone will reboot, preventing thieves from getting your data. (1/4) pic.twitter.com/H24Tfo1cSr
Magnet Forensics, a company that provides digital forensic products including the iPhone and Android data extraction tool Graykey, also confirmed that the timer for the feature is 72 hours.
“Inactivity reboot” effectively puts iPhones in a more secure state by locking the user’s encryption keys in the iPhone’s secure enclave chip.
“Even if thieves leave your iPhone powered on for a long time, they won’t be able to unlock it with cheaper, outdated forensic tooling,” Classen wrote on X. “While inactivity reboot makes it more challenging for law enforcement to get data from devices of criminals, this won’t lock them out completely. Three days is still plenty of time when coordinating steps with professional analysts.”

iPhones have two different states that can affect the ability of law enforcement, forensic experts, or hackers, to unlock them by brute-forcing the user’s passcode, or extracting data by exploiting security flaws in the iPhone software. These two states are “Before First Unlock,” or BFU, and “After First Unlock,” or AFU.
When the iPhone is in BFU state, the user’s data on their iPhone is fully encrypted and near-impossible to access, unless the person trying to get in knows the user’s passcode. In AFU state, on the other hand, certain data is unencrypted and may be easier to extract by some device forensic tools — even if the phone is locked.
An iPhone security researcher who goes by Tihmstar told TechCrunch that the iPhones in those two states are also referred to as “hot” or “cold” devices.
Tihmstar said that many forensic companies focus on “hot” devices in an AFU state, because at some point the user entered their correct passcode, which is stored in the memory of the iPhone’s secure enclave. By contrast, “cold” devices are far more difficult to compromise because their memory cannot be easily extracted once the phone restarts.
For years, Apple has added new security features that law enforcement have opposed and spoken out against, arguing that they are making their job harder. In 2016, the FBI took Apple to court in an effort to force the company to build a backdoor to unlock the iPhone of a mass-shooter. Eventually, the Australian startup Azimuth Security helped the FBI hack into the phone.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/ecolectro-stuffs-hydrogen-production-into-shipping-containers-to-cut-costs/,Ecolectro stuffs hydrogen production into shipping containers to cut costs | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-14,"For all its promise as a climate-friendly fuel, hydrogen hasn’t had much luck. It lost the battle over personal transportation to battery electric vehicles, and for industrial users, it remains far more expensive than natural gas.
That’s in part because natural gas can flow through sprawling networks of pipelines. Hydrogen doesn’t, which means buyers either have to rely on fossil-derived hydrogen (and its associated pollution) or truck it in at great expense.
Like many hydrogen entrepreneurs, Gabriel Rodriguez-Calero figures the best way to rein in costs is to bring production closer to where it’s being used. His startup, Ecolectro, is making hydrogen-producing electrolyzers that fit inside a shipping container.
“We are very interested in figuring out who’s trucking in hydrogen today,” he told TechCrunch. By making the gas on site, “you’re mitigating a lot of risk around logistics of transportation, logistics of storage at the site.”
But storage is just one problem that green hydrogen is facing. Simply making the stuff isn’t cheap, either. Some electrolyzers are made with expensive materials, while others using century-old technology aren’t very efficient. More recently, though, scientists have been exploring ways of making cheaper electrolyzers more efficient.
Rodriguez-Calero was one of them. After studying battery-related technologies while getting his doctorate from Cornell University, he and Kristina Hugar co-founded Ecolectro. Typically, electrolyzers follow one of two approaches: proton-exchange membrane (PEM) or alkaline electrolysis. The former tends to be pricier but more efficient, while the latter is less efficient but cheaper. Ecolectro adopts features of each by building a membrane that can withstand the harsher conditions of alkaline electrolysis.
Most membranes used in PEM electrolysis consist of PFAS compounds, which have come under scrutiny for their persistence in the environment. Ecolectro’s found a way to skip the PFAS. It also uses nickel as a catalyst instead of iridium or platinum, which are often used in PEM electrolyzers. “You can use 1,000 times the nickel per amount of iridium you might use and still not change the cost,” Rodriguez-Calero said.
The startup has built a small 10-kilowatt electrolyzer capable of producing 5 kilograms of hydrogen per day. It’s currently being tested by Liberty Utilities in Upstate New York, where the utility is blending hydrogen into the natural gas it distributes. Ecolectro is in the process of building its first commercial scale electrolyzer, a 250-kilowatt model that can pump out 125 kg per day. Rodriguez-Calero said the bigger version will be available in the first quarter of next year.
That’s smaller than many electrolyzer projects, which tend to be measured in megawatts. But Rodriguez-Calero thinks Ecolectro’s smaller, modular electrolyzes will help wary customers jump aboard. “That size is very attractive for the people who order one truck of hydrogen per week,” he said.
Lisa Coca, partner at Toyota Ventures, thinks that Ecolectro has a shot at producing hydrogen for $1.35 per kilogram by the end of the decade. That’s close to the Department of Energy’s goal of $1 per kilogram.
To help hit its targets, Ecolectro raised a $10.5 million Series A led by the Toyota Ventures climate fund with participation from Cornell University, New Climate Ventures, Starshot Capital, and Techstars."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/ai-pioneer-francois-chollet-leaves-google/,AI pioneer François Chollet leaves Google | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-14,"François Chollet, a leading figure in the AI world, is leaving Google after close to a decade.
In a post on X, the 34-year-old French developer said he’s starting a new company with “a friend,” but he declined to reveal many details.
“I’m very grateful for my decade at Google,” Chollet wrote in the post. “In that timespan, deep learning went from a niche academic topic to a massive industry employing millions.”
Chollet is perhaps best known as the creator of Keras, a high-level, open source API that can be used to create AI models and tackle machine learning tasks. A post on Google’s developer blog notes that Keras has over 2 million users and powers a number of high-profile tech products, like Waymo’s self-driving cars, as well as the recommendation engines on YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify.
In 2019, Chollet published the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmark, which measures the ability of AI systems to solve novel reasoning problems. This year, he launched the ARC Prize, a $1 million competition to beat ARC-AGI. (It remains unwon.)
Chollet has often argued that the approach taken by many of the major labs developing AI — feeding ever more data and computational resources to models — won’t achieve AI that’s as “smart” as humans. Instead, he thinks that methods that help models to “reason” in more human-like ways, like neuro-symbolic AI, are the most promising path forward.
In 2021, Chollet won the Global Swiss AI Award for breakthroughs in AI. And in September, he was named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in AI.
Chollet told Time that he envisions super intelligent AI as a tool for advancing human knowledge. “Artificial general intelligence is going to be a kind of super-competent scientist,” he said.
Chollet said that Jeff Carpenter, a machine learning engineer at Google, will be taking over as team lead for Keras.
“I have full confidence in Jeff and the incredibly talented Keras team to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in deep learning,” Chollet wrote in his post. “I will stay deeply involved with the Keras project from the outside.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/bitsight-buys-dark-web-security-specialist-cybersixgill-for-115m/,Bitsight buys dark web security specialist Cybersixgill for $115M | TechCrunch,Ingrid Lunden,2024-11-14,"More consolidation is afoot in the world of cybersecurity. Bitsight, a cybersecurity startup last valued at $2.4 billion when ratings firm Moody’s took a stake in the business and became its largest shareholder in 2021, is acquiring Cybersixgill for $115 million.
Boston-based Bitsight’s focus is cyber risk management. It works with enterprises to assess their risk profiles and specifically the likelihood that they will be breached, which covers not just evaluating a company’s attack surface across its network and other digital assets, but also the products that it uses to defend these.
Cybersixgill will give Bitsight another level of visibility in that effort: The smaller startup analyzes dark web activity specifically to proactively look for data leaks and indicators of potential breaches and new techniques. The collective area it focuses on is called “cyber threat intelligence” and it says it covers invite-only messaging groups, code repositories, paste sites, and clear web platforms.
Both companies lean heavily on AI in their work, and it sounds like they will complement each other in terms of what they focus on.
The smaller company, based out of Israel, originally launched as Sixgill. It had raised just under $56 million from investors including CrowdStrike, OurCrowd, and Terra Venture, per PitchBook data. But PitchBook also notes that the startup was last valued, in 2022, at just over $162 million. Cybersecurity has been a white-hot area of the market for funding in the last couple of years, but rising tides do not lift all paper boats.
The deal will see more money put into the tech that Cybersixgill was building. “We’re committed to investing in Cybersixgill’s industry-leading products and will continue to drive innovation to bring even greater value to customers,” said Steve Harvey, CEO of Bitsight, in a canned statement. The company is bringing on both the tech and the team."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/nearly-half-of-ai-data-centers-may-not-have-enough-power-by-2027/,Nearly half of AI data centers may not have enough power by 2027 | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-14,"AI’s insatiable thirst for electricity is expected to surge in the coming years, potentially leading to power shortages for data centers. New servers last year demanded 195 terawatt-hours of electricity, according to a new report from Gartner. That’s as much as 18 million households use in a year. But by 2027, new servers could command 500 terawatt-hours, or 46 million households’ worth.
That’s over and above the juice used by existing data centers, which already consumed 349 terawatt hours in 2022, according to a Goldman Sachs estimate. Without additional sources of carbon-free power, pollution from AI training and use could skyrocket. Sam Altman’s big bet on fusion power — over $375 million — is starting to make more sense."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/eu-ai-act-draft-guidance-for-general-purpose-ais-shows-first-steps-for-big-ai-to-comply/,EU AI Act: Draft guidance for general purpose AIs shows first steps for Big AI to comply | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-11-14,"A first draft of a Code of Practice that will apply to providers of general-purpose AI models under the European Union’s AI Act has been published, alongside an invitation for feedback — open until November 28 — as the drafting process continues into next year, ahead of formal compliance deadlines kicking in over the coming years.
The pan-EU law, which came into force this summer, regulates applications of artificial intelligence under a risk-based framework. But it also targets some measures at more powerful foundational — or general-purpose — AI models (GPAIs). This is where this Code of Practice will come in.
Among those likely to be in the frame are OpenAI, maker of the GPT models (which underpin the AI chatbot ChatGPT), Google with its Gemini GPAIs, Meta with Llama, Anthropic with Claude, and others, like France’s Mistral. They will be expected to abide by the General-Purpose AI Code of Practice if they want to make sure they are complying with the AI Act and thus avoid the risk of enforcement for non-compliance.
To be clear, the Code is intended to provide guidance for meeting the EU AI Act’s obligations. GPAI providers may choose to deviate from the best practice suggestions if they believe they can demonstrate compliance via other measures.
This first draft of the Code runs to 36 pages but is likely to get longer — perhaps considerably so — as the drafters warn it’s light on detail as it’s “a high-level drafting plan that outlines our guiding principles and objectives for the Code.”
The draft is peppered with box-outs asking “open questions” the working groups tasked with producing the Code have yet to resolve. The sought for feedback — from industry and civil society — will clearly play a key role in shaping the substance of specific Sub-Measures and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are yet to be included.
But the document gives a sense of what’s coming down the pipe (in terms of expectations) for GPAI makers, once the relevant compliance deadlines apply.
Transparency requirements for makers of GPAIs are set to enter into force on August 1, 2025.
But for the most powerful GPAIs — those the law defines as having “systemic risk” — the expectation is they must abide by risk assessment and mitigation requirements 36 months after entry into force (or August 1, 2027).
There’s a further caveat in that the draft Code has been devised on the assumption that there will only be “a small number” of GPAI makers and GPAIs with systemic risk. “Should that assumption prove wrong, future drafts may need to be changed significantly, for instance, by introducing a more detailed tiered system of measures aiming to focus primarily on those models that provide the largest systemic risks,” the drafters warn.
On the transparency front, the Code will set out how GPAIs must comply with information provisions, including in the area of copyrighted material.
One example here is “Sub-Measure 5.2”, which currently commits signatories to providing details of the name of all web crawlers used for developing the GPAI and their relevant robots.txt features “including at the time of crawling.”
GPAI model makers continue to face questions over how they acquired data to train their models, with multiple lawsuits filed by rights holders alleging AI firms unlawfully processed copyrighted information.
Another commitment set out in the draft Code requires GPAI providers to have a single point of contact and complaint handling to make it easier for rights holders to communicate grievances “directly and rapidly.”
Other proposed measures related to copyright cover documentation that GPAIs will be expected to provide about the data sources used for “training, testing and validation and about authorisations to access and use protected content for the development of a general-purpose AI.”
The most powerful GPAIs are also subject to rules in the EU AI Act that aim to mitigate so-called “systemic risk.” These AI systems are currently defined as models that have been trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs.
The Code contains a list of risk types that signatories will be expected to treat as systemic risks. They include:
This version of the Code also suggests that GPAI makers could identify other types of systemic risks that are not explicitly listed, too — such as “large-scale” privacy infringements and surveillance, or uses that might pose risks to public health. And one of the open questions the document poses here asks which risks should be prioritized for addition to the main taxonomy. Another one is how the taxonomy of systemic risks should address deepfake risks (related to AI-generated child sexual abuse material and non-consensual intimate imagery).
The Code also seeks to provide guidance around identifying key attributes that could lead to models creating systemic risks, such as “dangerous model capabilities” (e.g. cyber offensive or “weapon acquisition or proliferation capabilities”), and “dangerous model propensities” (e.g. being misaligned with human intent and/or values; having a tendency to deceive; bias; confabulation; lack of reliability and security; and resistance to goal modification).
While much detail still remains to be filled in, as the drafting process continues, the authors of the Code write that its measures, sub-measures, and KPIs should be “proportionate” with a particular focus on “tailoring to the size and capacity of a specific provider, particularly SMEs and start-ups with less financial resources than those at the frontier of AI development.” Attention should also be paid to “different distribution strategies (e.g. open-sourcing), where appropriate, reflecting the principle of proportionality and taking into account both benefits and risks,” they add.
Many of the open questions the draft poses concern how specific measures should be applied to open source models.
Another measure in the code concerns a “Safety and Security Framework” (SSF). GPAI makers will be expected to detail their risk management policies and “continuously and thoroughly” identify systemic risks that could arise from their GPAI.
Here there’s an interesting sub-measure on “Forecasting risks.” This would commit signatories to include in their SSF “best effort estimates” of timelines for when they expect to develop a model that triggers systemic risk indicators — such as the aforementioned dangerous model capabilities and propensities. It could mean that, starting in 2027, we’ll see cutting-edge AI developers putting out time frames for when they expect model development to cross certain risk thresholds.
Elsewhere, the draft Code puts a focus on GPAIs with systemic risk using “best-in-class evaluations” of their models’ capabilities and limitations and applying “a range of suitable methodologies” to do so. Listed examples include: Q&A sets, benchmarks, red-teaming and other methods of adversarial testing, human uplift studies, model organisms, simulations, and proxy evaluations for classified materials.
Another sub-measure on “substantial systemic risk notification” would commit signatories to notify the AI Office, an oversight and steering body established under the Act, “if they have strong reason to believe substantial systemic risk might materialise.”
The Code also sets out measures on “serious incident reporting.”
“Signatories commit to identify and keep track of serious incidents, as far as they originate from their general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, document and report, without undue delay, any relevant information and possible corrective measures to the AI Office and, as appropriate, to national competent authorities,” it reads — although an associated open question asks for input on “what does a serious incident entail.” So there looks to be more work to be done here on nailing down definitions.
The draft Code includes further questions on “possible corrective measures” that could be taken in response to serious incidents. It also asks “what serious incident response processes are appropriate for open weight or open-source providers?”, among other feedback-seeking formulations.
“This first draft of the Code is the result of a preliminary review of existing best practices by the four specialised Working Groups, stakeholder consultation input from nearly 430 submissions, responses from the provider workshop, international approaches (including the G7 Code of Conduct, the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, the Bletchley Declaration, and outputs from relevant government and standard-setting bodies), and, most importantly, the AI Act itself,” the drafters go on to say in conclusion.
“We emphasise that this is only a first draft and consequently the suggestions in the draft Code are provisional and subject to change,” they add. “Therefore, we invite your constructive input as we further develop and update the contents of the Code and work towards a more granular final form for May 1, 2025.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/amazons-telehealth-platform-adds-low-cost-plans-for-hair-loss-skin-care-and-more/,"Amazon's telehealth platform adds low-cost plans for hair loss, skin care, and more | TechCrunch",Aisha Malik,2024-11-14,"Amazon One Medical is expanding its telehealth services with the launch of upfront and low-cost treatment plans and medication delivery for several beauty and lifestyle concerns. Customers can get treatment plans and medication for men’s hair loss for as low as $16 per month, anti-aging skin care for $10 per month, and erectile disfunction care for $19 per month.
Other treatment plans include medication for motion sickness and eyelash growth.
The move puts Amazon in direct competition with Hims & Hers, a direct-to-consumer telehealth company that offers treatment plans for a variety of health and wellness concerns like hair loss, erectile disfunction, weight loss, and more for a monthly fee.
Prime members will be able to see the price of their telehealth consultation and medication for their desired treatment before they move forward with  care. An on-demand messaging visit costs $29 and a video visit costs $49.
Amazon says customers only pay for the consultation and the medication, and that there aren’t any additional fees, expenses, or subscriptions needed other than Amazon Prime.
After medication is prescribed, Prime members can have their medication delivered to them — in some cases within hours.
“This simple care experience was built to meet the needs of today’s customer,” said Dr. Vin Gupta, chief medical officer for Amazon Pharmacy, in a press release. “At Amazon, we’re working to reduce the burden on patients who’d like to move forward with care, but may be tired of navigating the hurdles of our health care system, waiting in a long line at the pharmacy, or worried about a surprise bill or medication cost.”
Thursday’s announcement marks Amazon’s latest efforts to accelerate its healthcare services.
A few weeks ago, Amazon Pharmacy announced that it’s expanding its same-day delivery service to 20 more U.S. cities next year, including  Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Diego. Amazon will reveal the other 15 cities in the coming months.
Amazon purchased primary care tech provider One Medical in 2022 to launch Amazon One Medical the following year. The company launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 after it purchased online pharmacy PillPack in 2018. Last year, Amazon launched RxPass, a service that offers Prime members in the U.S. as many generic versions of medications as they need for a $5 monthly fee."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/mission-space-launches-next-quarter-to-provide-real-time-space-weather-forecasts/,Mission Space launches next quarter to provide real-time space weather forecasts | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-11-14,"When you board a plane, the pilot already knows the weather on the flight path and can steer clear, or at least warn you it’s coming. The same can’t be said of “space weather” from solar events, which can seriously affect satellites and even passenger planes.
Mission Space is about to launch a constellation to provide near-real-time monitoring of this increasingly important phenomenon.
Space weather is a general term for the radiation in the near-Earth environment; outside the planet’s protective aura, satellites and spacecraft feel the full brunt of the sun’s rays, and a solar storm can interfere with or disable them. The type and intensity of this radiation shifts and flows just like atmospheric weather, but being invisible and moving at the speed of light, it’s considerably more difficult to observe and predict.
There are numerous satellites and deep-space missions that monitor solar radiation, but they are necessarily limited; imagine trying to predict the path of a storm using only a handful of wind and rain sensors scattered across the ocean. And while historically this has been sufficient, the growth of the new space economy has transformed space weather from an occasional inconvenience to a constant and quantifiable threat.
“More and more companies are putting space weather on their agenda,” said Alex Pospekhov, CEO and founder of Mission Space. “We have 7,000 satellites in space, but in 10 years it’ll be 50,000; that means space weather events will be the same as now, but they will have 10 times the impact.”
A serious solar storm is dangerous not only to electronics, but also to unprepared astronauts. If someone happens to be doing a spacewalk, they could get a face full of radiation — and if we want to establish a permanent presence on the moon, where there’s similarly little protection, we’ll want to know exactly when it’s safe to go outside.
Nearer the surface, airlines are concerned about passengers getting large doses of radiation during a long flight over the poles, and some have even canceled flights because of it. And there are numerous secondary effects on services that rely on satellites, including precision agriculture.
Pospekhov’s startup, originally founded in Europe but now based in Israel and the U.S., is about to launch the first two of a planned 24-satellite constellation that will monitor space weather and provide reports and predictions in near real time.
It’s not intended to replace the scientific instruments currently in space, but augment their data (much of which is public) with a voluminous, proprietary stream that enables more precise, timely monitoring.
Pospekhov explained that while many companies and governments are increasingly aware of the need for better space weather prediction, the satellites are aging and the data is difficult to share.
“The infrastructure for space weather monitoring was developed in the late 90s, and many of the scientific models were developed 50 years ago,” Pospekhov said. Information sharing agreements between organizations like NASA, NOAA, and ESA are complex, and the data itself is not trivial to integrate and harmonize.
“There are no people in the companies who need this data who can understand it. What’s needed is, say, alerts for different alert levels for launch, or for airlines. Everyone uses weather data but no one thinks about how it is generated: you just want to know if it’s going to rain or not. It’s the same here,” he continued.
Mission Space currently uses public sources, doing the work of normalizing it to create something of a unified data stream. But they are launching the first two of their own satellites in the first quarter of 2025, with more planned for later that year. Pospekhov said they could probably launch faster, but that it’s more beneficial to learn from the first set and improve as they go. “Engineers…” he said, “There are always more changes.”
The satellites themselves are specialized but not exotic, he noted, leading to a lower cost for a constellation of 24 than you might expect. The important part is the sensor payload (which they call “Zohar,”) still collects 15 parameters, a thousand times a second.
“Space weather is a data monopoly game: the first to launch the constellation and build the infrastructure will win,” he predicted. “Even with half a constellation, in two years we will generate a thousand times more space weather data than humans have generated in the last 60. And the real-time data will let us develop machine learning models based on it.”
They are not in competition with governments and scientific organizations, he claimed, or really even startups looking to serve those customers — collaboration is a necessity for a number of reasons.
Their customers are “aerospace in general; satellite operators and space tourism companies; anyone doing private space stations. They’re all very aware of the problem,” said Pospekhov. “It was common knowledge in the aviation industry but now the companies are actually paying attention to solutions. And of course for defense, they’ve been developing the domain, and you must be sure you will not have issues in critical space operations. With the current level of precision, that’s hard for them.”
While the real-time readings and predictions will have to wait for the full constellation, the pair going up in a few months should offer a marked improvement over the existing offerings. No exact date is set for launch."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/swiftconnect-lets-workers-access-the-office-with-a-smartphone-swipe/,SwiftConnect lets workers access the office with a smartphone swipe | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-14,"With the advent of flexible workspaces, companies are increasingly adopting smartphone-based authentication to let employees enter and leave. In a recent poll, nearly two in five firms said they’re letting staff use their phones to access office buildings.
The boon has benefited vendors like SwiftConnect, which sells a platform for managing access to physical offices. Chip Kruger and Matt Kopel founded the company in 2020 after selling their previous company, Waltz, to WeWork in 2019.
Kopel said he had the idea for SwiftConnect while at WeWork, where he briefly worked after the Waltz acquisition. The on-demand, mobile-centric access control WeWork wanted, he believed, was going to become the standard for many offices going forward.
SwiftConnect’s platform is designed to abstract away access management for office spaces. Using the service, employees can add their employee badge to Apple Wallet or Google Wallet on their smartphones. Once added, the digital badge gives them access to enter their building and/or shared amenity spaces secured by NFC door locks.
From a dashboard, admins can issue credentials so that employees can enter only approved rooms.
SwiftConnect isn’t the first to market with a mobile-centric access control management platform. Openpath, Kisi, and Verkada, among others, offer software to replace physical access cards with personal devices.
But Kruger asserts that SwiftConnect is one of the few that doesn’t require companies to install new reader hardware. That has helped it win clients like Silverstein Properties, which owns 7 World Trade Center in New York City, Kruger said.
SwiftConnect, which claims its system is live in over 100 million square feet of office space, said last year that it didn’t expect to need to raise additional capital “unless strategic opportunities presented themselves.”
It seems like those strategic opportunities presented themselves. SwiftConnect this month raised $37 million in a Series B round led by Quadri Ventures, with participation from HID, Egis Capital Partners, Klingenstein Fields Advisors, Crow Holdings, JLL Spark, Navitas Capital, and Spring Rock Capital.
“To address any potential headwinds, we decided to raise more than enough funding to weather any upcoming economic storms,” Kruger said.
The new cash, which brings the startup’s total capital raised to $74 million, will be put toward growing the company’s 135-person team and expanding to new geographies, Kopel said. SwiftConnect has offices in Montreal and Stamford, currently.
Strategic acquisitions are on the table as well; last year, SwiftConnect used a portion of its war chest to buy Detrios, an access control firm.
“SwiftConnect is extending our expertise into the high-end, multi-family rental market, and has completed deployments in this space,” Kruger said. “We’re helping enable self-service, unfettered access to parking garages, buildings, turnstiles, office suites, and amenity spaces for tenants across their portfolio of properties.”
While it’s growing at a healthy clip, SwiftConnect faces potential headwinds. Mobile-centric access control systems can leave workers in a lurch if their smartphones shut down. And systems such as SwiftConnect’s have raised privacy concerns.
A Business Insider piece notes that firms including PwC, Amazon, and Goldman Sachs are using badges to record employees’ working locations. According to one recent survey, 62% of organizations plan to use badge swipes to track attendance.
It’ll be incumbent on SwiftConnect to show it can deliver convenience without undue surveillance.
“Our platform is founded on a privacy-by-design principle where we collect the minimal amount of user information necessary to operate the service,” Kruger said. “Our customers retain full control over user data we process on their behalf.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/mach9-is-equipping-infrastructure-operators-with-better-information/,Mach9 is equipping infrastructure operators with better information | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-11-14,"Clean water, safe roads, accessible broadband and electricity: These things are not a given. They depend on vast infrastructure networks that need to be constantly maintained and improved in order to function. America is failing badly on this front. In its latest report card, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the country’s aging infrastructure a dismal C-.
According to Mach9, a startup founded in 2021, part of the solution is in furnishing infrastructure providers with better information about the physical world. The company is using AI to convert mobile lidar (light detection and ranging, a type of imaging technology) scans into 2D and 3D engineering models at a fraction of the cost and time than standard processes. This means that utility companies, engineering firms, construction companies, and others can make timely progress on massive infrastructure projects, know where to direct capital for upgrades, or just better understand the assets under their stewardship.
The company’s flagship product, Digital Surveyor, can also automatically identify more than 20 features, like utility poles, traffic signals, and road signs. The status quo is that these features are manually identified by human operators. Mach9’s customers include some major infrastructure providers and engineering service companies in the U.S. and Canada, like Michael Baker International, POWER Engineers, Langan, and Fibersmith.
Alexander Baikovitz, Mach9 co-founder and CEO, said he got into this space while at Carnegie Mellon University. As a robotics student researcher, he worked on infrastructure projects like decontaminating legacy nuclear facilities for the U.S. Department of Energy, and he realized that “a lot of the robotics problems that we were solving were actually hardcore survey and mapping problems.” Which is to say, infrastructure projects are often halted from the beginning — even armed with the best robots to venture into radiation-filled facilities like the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington state — if you don’t have robust data on where things are and the state they’re in.
“A lot of owners and operators of infrastructure have been seeing problems like aging and deterioration, extreme weather. Infrastructure is just changing so, so fast these days, and the way that we can continue to stay on top of a lot of these big challenges is with better data and better maps in the first place,” he said.
Mach9 originally pursued a hardware play; the aim was to develop mobile mapping systems and collect the geospatial data themselves by putting lidar and imaging payloads on top of vehicles. The company was accepted to Y Combinator’s Summer 2021 cohort and raised $2.5 million later that year. But many OEMs are already building great equipment to generate maps, and after talking to customers, Baikovitz said the company realized that the bigger problem was how to turn all that mapping data into insights.
“Most people take for granted/don’t realize how hard it is to keep infrastructure up to date with the changing world,” he said. That’s where Digital Surveyor comes in.
Today, Mach9 is selling the Digital Surveyor software to engineering consultants, public and private infrastructure owners, and operators to help them turn this data into insights: to identify every utility pole within a utility company’s massive network, for example. In many instances, it takes a person two to four days per map mile to identify all the features; with Digital Surveyor, it takes less than 10 minutes a mile for a human to review and validate the software’s labels.
Digital Surveyor can not just identify features but provide more detailed information about them. Baikovitz walked me through a product demo and showed how Digital Surveyor can not only identify a utility pole but quickly tell me the angle at which that utility pole is leaning. This capability is critical for situations where people need information really quickly, Baikovitz said, like after an extreme weather event.
The company recently closed a $12 million seed round led by Quiet Capital, with participation from new and existing investors including Overmatch Ventures, Cruise founder Kyle Vogt, former Autodesk CEO Amar Hanspal, Adobe CPO Scott Belsky, and former DoorDash executive Gokul Rajaram. The company plans to grow its 14-person team and build out the software, including adding more identifiable objects. The aim is to scale from being able to automatically identify around 20 different features today to “hundreds and thousands” in the future, Baikovitz said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/the-browser-company-makes-arc-search-for-android-generally-available-as-it-thinks-about-other-products/,Mobile browser Arc Search is now generally available on Android | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-14,"Following an October beta release for Android, mobile browser, Arc Search, hit general availability Thursday.
Its developer, The Browser Company, is known for its desktop browser Arc. To reach more users and employ AI-based search, the company launched Arc Search for iOS earlier this year. The new version will possibly open up Arc Search’s reach to millions of Android users.
When the startup launched Arc Search on Android, it had limited features, including Browse for Me, ad block, and auto archiving tabs. With the stable version, it gets voice search, adaptable widgets, and icons for the home screen, support for landscape mode, browse for me in your native language, and full Android 12 support.
The company said that within weeks of launching the open beta, more than 100,000 people had downloaded Arc Search through the Play Store.
While the Browser Company promises to keep releasing Android version updates, it’s shifting its attention toward building newer products.
In a video last month, Browser Company CEO, Josh Miller, said that while Arc is in its current version, the startup valued at $550 million is thinking about building new products that are more palatable to a wider audience.
Some users have complained that Arc is difficult to both learn and use, resulting in a loss of audience.
In a conversation with The Verge, Miller said that despite 4x user growth, the company understood that Arc isn’t a mainstream product.
The Browser Company hasn’t fully divulged details about what the final product might look like. Miller has claimed it will let users “glide around the internet” and get stuff done. The company also wants to build a powerful command bar that can help guide to the right result through AI. The company has shown off some of these features as concepts or smaller functional releases within the existing Arc browser.
The challenge for the startup will be balancing Arc power users, while developing a product with broader appeal."

It’s not clear what the FBI was seeking. In particular, it’s unclear if Polymarket, Coplan, or both are the targets of an investigation.
Polymarket, one of the most active prediction betting markets, gained mainstream attention during the recent U.S. presidential election. Americans are prohibited by law from using the market, which recently raised over $80 million from investors including Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.
In a statement to Axios, the spokesperson called the move “obvious political retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential election.” They added: “Polymarket is a fully transparent prediction market that helps everyday people better understand the events that matter most to them, including elections.”
Prediction markets including Polymarket and its competitors Kalshi and PredictIt paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to election betters following Donald Trump’s victory."

Until now, iOS users either had to use the Google app or mobile web to chat with the AI technology.
The new Gemini iOS app supports text-based prompts in 35 languages. Plus, users can have a conversation with Gemini through its Gemini Live feature in 12 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Portuguese, Arabic, Italian, Indonesian, Japanese, Turkish, and Vietnamese. Google said it aims to introduce support for additional languages soon.
While some of the other features of Gemini, such as asking it to suggest recipes or seeking help for studies, were already available through the Google app and mobile web, Gemini Live is a new addition to the native iOS app.
App users can also generate images through Google’s Imagen 3 model. In August, the company started allowing Gemini Advanced, Business and Enterprise users to create images of people again after pausing the feature for months following criticism around the model generating photos with historical inaccuracies.
Users can also use extensions to ask Gemini questions about information related to other Google accounts they may have, like Gmail, Maps, YouTube, and Calendar.
Google released the Gemini Android app in February, first in the U.S. and later in countries including Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, and the U.K. The company gradually added support for Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Portuguese. Google also brought the Gemini app to India — and other South Asian countries, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka — with support for nine local languages by June.
Notably, Apple’s Siri integration with ChatGPT is currently live in the iOS 18.2 public beta, which means all users could get this feature in a few weeks’ time. Earlier this year, during its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced its plans to integrate Google Gemini with Apple Intelligence in the future.
“We’re looking forward to integrating with other models, including Google Gemini, for instance, in the future,” Apple SVP Craig Federighi said in a conversation during the event. Google launching Gemini on iOS is possibly the first step in that direction.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-moves-to-place-google-under-supervision/,Consumer Financial Protection Bureau moves to place Google under supervision | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-14,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has taken steps to place Google under formal federal supervision, a move that could subject the company to the same inspections the government imposes on major banks.
According to The Washington Post, the CFPB has been in talks with Google for months about the supervision order, which hasn’t yet been made final. Formed in 2008, the CFPB has broad powers to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or predatory financial practices, including affording regulators access to a company’s internal records to ensure their activities are sound — and seek remedies if they’re not.
The exact scope of the CFPB’s concerns with Google isn’t clear, notes The Post, and the political fate of the bureau’s work under director Rohit Chopra is also in doubt. But the move adds to Google’s regulatory headaches in the U.S., where it’s lost a major antitrust trial and faces another over its advertising technology."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/sales-tax-automation-startup-kintsugi-doubled-its-valuation-this-year/,Sales tax automation startup Kintsugi doubled its valuation this year | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-11-14,"A 2018 Supreme Court ruling eliminated the requirement that an e-commerce retailer needed a physical location in a state in order for said state to be able to collect sales tax on purchases made by residents. While the decision was a boon for states, it created a headache for e-commerce sellers.
Kintsugi is looking to offload and automate calculating and filing sales tax for companies. The San Francisco-based company’s AI technology connects to a company’s billing and payment systems and figures out in which states they are liable to pay sales tax. It then registers users in the correct states. From there, the system can automatically calculate and remit what a company owes in sales tax to keep companies in compliance.
Kintsugi raised a $6 million Series A round earlier this year led by Link Ventures that valued it at a $40 million post valuation in April. The company has since reopened its Series A round, taken on additional $4 million in capital led by Airwallex, and doubled its valuation to $80 million.
Pujun Bhatnagar, Kintsugi co-founder and CEO, said that he got interested in the sales tax space while working as a senior machine learning engineer at Meta in 2018. Bhatnagar told TechCrunch that both his father and grandfather worked in taxation their entire careers. Bhatnagar found himself in 2018 wondering what he wanted to do with his life. It just so happened to be around the same time as the Supreme Court ruling, which opened up a whole new market that was worth exploring, he said.
“It’s basically an amalgamation of 52 different types of little countries, which have their own laws and jurisdictions when it comes to local governments,” Bhatnagar said. “And 48 of these jurisdictions have sales-tax-related laws.”
To really understand the problem, Bhatnagar said he started doing sales tax for e-commerce and SaaS companies by hand for a year and a half to really understand the pain points before writing any code. He made Kintsugi’s first few employees calculate sales tax by hand, too.
From there they built a platform and algorithm to modernize and automate sales tax compliance. Bhatnagar said that building the model in-house has made their results more accurate than competitors that rely on large, all-encompassing language models. He said that the company keeps humans in the loop to monitor for accuracy, too.
The company was formally founded in 2022 and launched its website in August 2023. Bhatnagar said inbound interest was immediate, and Kintsugi has been able to grow its customer base to more than 1,100 users in the past year. It has earned $1 million in revenue.
Kintsugi isn’t unique in wanting to modernize the sales tax process for companies. Competitors include Anrok, which has raised more than $50 million in venture money, and CereTax, which has raised $19 million in venture capital, in addition to numerous legacy companies that outsource the process to folks in countries like India. This is the same type of work that Bhatnagar’s family had worked on.
Bhatnagar thinks that part of the reason demand has been so high for Kintsugi is its approach to landing customers. The company allows potential customers to sign up for free and test out whether they like it. If they choose to proceed, they can pay $100 per tax filing or create a custom plan. Bhatnagar added that some of their competitors charge hefty fees just for onboarding to their platforms.
“We are the only company in the space that has a ‘get started’ button, that has a ‘we will do your sales tax analysis for free [button],’” Bhatnagar said. “And that’s not going to be just done once. You can create a free account, and every seven minutes the report is going to be updated for you. And that’s a value prop that we want to provide to founders for free, even if they decide to not pay a single dime for Kintsugi.”
Kintsugi plans to use its new capital to keep expanding its tech and to help the company gear up to expand into Canada and Europe.
“We are a bunch of nerds,” Bhatnagar said. “We are not trying to sell any snake oil. Connect your data, see the results.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/tourlane-the-german-travel-startup-raises-26m-led-by-sequoia/,German travel startup Tourlane raises $26M led by Sequoia | TechCrunch,Ingrid Lunden,2024-11-14,"Global travel continues to gain ground, with the World Travel and Tourism Council predicting the industry will cross $11 trillion in revenues this year. Consumers are evolving from the so-called “revenge travel” of the post-COVID-19 years, dedicating a growing share of their budget to a wider array of experiences away from home. Add AI to the mix, and we now have renewed investor interest in startups looking to disrupt the landscape with something new.
Riding the travel train, Berlin-based Tourlane — an agent-esque platform that lets users plan and budget trips, bringing together flights, accommodations, activities, and tickets — has raised a fresh €25 million ($26 million) in funding in hopes of capitalizing on those trends.
The Series D, led by Sequoia Capital, is intended as a bridge to help the company reach profitability, Julian Weselek, Tourlane’s CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch. The startup will use the funds also to expand its tech, double down on AI, and potentially expand to more origination markets beyond its current bases in France and Germany.
The AI investment may be the detail that catches your eye. Weselek said the company is bringing in generative AI around the front end of the service to build more intuitive ways to help steer users toward options for what they want.
He said that won’t spell a full replacement of humans, though. “Is it possible to build the tech to give customers a fully automated offer? Yes, sure that can be done,” Weselek said. “I think the question is, if you know your marriage depends on this next holiday, do you want [that, or] to have a consultation with someone who has been in the country to make a sign off on the booking?”
Tourlane is also making a significant bet on the back end, where AI will help evaluate the thousands of permutations of flights, accommodation, cars, activities, time of year, and other variables to maximize the chances of getting users what they want — and Tourlane more revenues, too, as a result.
The company, Weselek added, has around 500 employees, of which about 150 are customer agents. He said as a “relative number” that figure is “going down,” compared to how many customers each agent helps. “They are becoming more efficient.”
Beyond AI, perhaps equally significant for Tourlane is the question of scale. Founded in 2015, the startup is now nearly a decade old, and to date, it says it has booked trips for 100,000 individuals (each person in a booking counts as an individual).
It’s also serving more customers: Weselek said last year was five times stronger than its last year before COVID-19 hit.
Still, relatively speaking, 100,000 isn’t a huge number. Figures from the UN estimate that the number of travelers globally totaled 790 million in the first seven months of 2024.
And it’s unclear what the payoff is for Tourlane. Like traditional travel agents, Tourlane makes a commission on the services it sells, but it does not disclose how much, instead saying the fee varies depending on different factors and partners.
Nonetheless, this is clearly a bet that Sequoia Capital feels is worth taking. The venture firm is now Tourlane’s largest outside investor.
“This is a unique moment in the history of travel. With AI, every traveler will have the opportunity to see the world through personalized custom travel experiences,” Andrew Reed, the Sequoia partner who led this investment, said in a statement. “Tourlane is positioned to delight millions of travelers in the years to come.”
Sequoia is an interesting name to have on the cap table, given the success the storied venture firm has had in travel so far. Its past investments have included Airbnb (one of its earliest investors, Sequoia became one of the biggest winners when it IPO’d), Skyscanner (one of Sequoia’s first investments in Europe, now part of Trip.com), Klook, and Kayak (now part of Booking), along with many other smaller startups in the space.
Other investors participating in the Series D include Target Global (a new backer), Jared Smith (co-founder of Qualtrics), and HV Capital.
Tourlane isn’t disclosing its current valuation, but for context, the last time it raised money — a $20 million Series C extension round — it had a $242 million valuation, the same as what it was valued in its original $47 million Series C. The first tranche of that Series C round closed just months before the pandemic hit, and the second closed in the middle of it, when Tourlane raised money to hang on until people traveled again.
Perhaps because of the rollercoaster that Tourlane has lived through so far, or because the valuation is modest this time as well, Weselek said he does not treat that number as a focus or priority.
“Company valuations in the private market are highly volatile and strongly influenced by several external factors that we can’t control, such as the cost of capital, investment hype cycles, and perceived risk levels,” he said. “What is important to us right now is the fact that we have successfully secured €25 million of funding from world-class investors, which enables us to bridge the path to profitability while further investing in our product, our service, and our growth. If we succeed in our ambitions, we will generate a lot of shareholder value in the years to come.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/influur-wants-to-standout-from-other-influencer-marketplaces-by-promising-timely/,Influur wants to stand out from other influencer marketplaces by promising timely payout | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-14,"As the influencer economy grows, startups like Passionfroot, Agentio, and One Impression, along with social platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok are trying to build marketplaces to connect brands with creators.
Miami-based startup Influur is banking on two unique aspects of its platform: quick response from creators and financial tools to ensure they are paid on time.
The company is developing a suite of tools for brands to track campaigns better. Additionally, it is considering introducing new financial products for creators, including loans, debit cards, and credit cards.
To support these efforts, Influur has raised $10 million in Series A funding from Point72 Ventures and HTwenty Capital, bringing its total funding to over $15 million. Angel investors include Sofía Vergara and Thalía.
Ishan Sinha, a partner at Point72 Ventures, said that the platform helps creators become better entrepreneurs.
“Creators are good at making content. But they might not be business-savvy entrepreneurs. So having a place where their money can live, they can get a quick payout, and see their analytics is powerful,” he said.
Influur was founded in 2021 by four Latina female founders: CEO Alessandra Angelini, who worked at CNN as a producer before founding the company; chief influencer officer Fefi Oliveira, who has worked in the entertainment industry with companies like Nickelodeon and Telemundo and has over 9 million followers across her social media accounts; chief sales officer Paula Coleman, who also worked at CNN as a producer; and chief product officer Valeria Angelini, who worked as a data analyst at FedEx.
Before starting Influur, Angelini asked Oliveira, whom she met in college, why creators were not responding to CNN’s contact attempts. Oliveira explained that influencers receive thousands of messages on Instagram and email, making it hard to manage them all.
To tackle this problem, Angelini envisioned a tool for influencer marketing, similar to Google AdSense, to manage a brand’s spending in that space.
Upon onboarding, creators can connect all their social media accounts, display their pricing for marketing engagements, and list past brand collaborations. The startup founders noted that the platform currently hosts over 40,000 creators with various follower counts.
Creators can apply for open brand campaigns that match their criteria. They can also opt for “gifted collabs,” where they receive a brand’s product in exchange for content. As for brands, they can also individually approach select creators for collaborations.
On the platform, creators can get suggestions and tips from other experienced creators and learn from them. To keep interactions relevant, the platform restricts posting to creators with over 2,000 followers.
Angelini said many marketplaces list influencers by scraping web data, which often leads to low response rates. She mentioned that an influencer typically responds to a brand request within 24 hours on Influur.
Influur also offers a premium subscription for creators priced at $30 per month, which gives them access to a one-click media kit with details of their price rates, past campaigns, socials, and engagement rates. They also get access to experiences where they can create content and exclusive webinars from popular creators.
According to Oliveira — who has been a creator for years — one of the main problems has been chasing brands for payouts after the work is complete. To solve this problem, Influur asks brands to pay money up front, stores the money in an escrow, and then transfers it to a creator’s wallet when they ship all campaign deliverables.
“Influencers have often waited 60 to 120 days after posting the final product to get paid. We are solving that problem with our wallet and instant pay feature,” Oliveira said.
Creators can wait 30 days to get their payout or instantly withdraw the money with a 15% fee to Influur. Currently, the company supports payouts in a dozen countries, including the U.S., Mexico, and Brazil. The startup mentioned that 20% of its creators have paid that fee to get a quick payout.
In the future, the startup plans to launch a set of financial tools for creators, such as virtual accounts, short-term loans, credit cards, and debit cards. “Influencers want Influur to become their bank. We plan to launch a new financial product, so we are not only part of earning money for influencers but also a part of how they save and spend money,” Angelini said.
Point72 Venture’s Sinha said that in the fund’s diligence, it found that creators wanted financial stability and that the startup was building the right tools to achieve it.
With its Series A raise, Influur is working on adding insights for influencer campaigns along with financial tools. The company is also building a prediction engine so that companies can predict how a campaign might perform with a particular creator.
The company is expanding its team across its four hubs: San Francisco, Miami, Mexico, and Argentina.
In addition to charging creators a 15% instant payout fee and a premium subscription, Influur also charges a 20% to 25% service fee for every transaction from brands. While the company had some profitable months last year, it’s going to take a while before Influur generates a profit as it aims to be overall cash-flow positive by 2026.
The startup believes that it has an edge over other marketplaces thanks to its financial tools, its insights engine, and having a popular creator as a co-founder."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/tiger-global-backed-invideo-introduces-gen-ai-based-video-creation/,Tiger Global-backed InVideo launches GenAI-based video creation | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-14,"Indian video editing platform InVideo is launching a generative AI-powered video creation feature that lets you  use prompts to generate video clips.
The platform, backed by the likes of Tiger Global and Peak XV, is calling this release InVideo v3.0. You can use text prompts to generate a video in various styles, including live-action, animated, or anime, and export the resulting video in formats suitable for YouTube, Shorts/Reels, and LinkedIn. Users can also edit these videos by prompting for changes or additions to specific parts of a clip.
InVideo hasn’t developed its own model to power this feature. Instead, it’s using a pipeline of different models to parse prompts and generate videos.
Sanket Shah, InVideo’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that theoretically there’s no upper limit to how long these generated videos can be, but users will be capped at how many generation credits they have. There doesn’t seem to be a free tier.
To foot the bills for this new feature, the company is adding a new paid plan called Generative Plan, which lets you generate 15 minutes of video for $120 per month. Users can buy additional minutes for $8 to $10 per minute on any plan, the company said.
Last year, the app released a prompt-based video-generation feature that could not create videos from scratch, but just patched up licensed stock footage and photos into a video, which looked a tad crude.
While the new tool can generate videos multiple minutes in length, if you check out the videos on the company’s site, you will notice the style and quality of the video changing mid-video, which feels off. The startup said it will improve the tool’s generation ability with time.
The company is diving into a space where other video editors, such as Captions, D-ID, and Lightricks, have introduced AI-powered video generation for the different segments of the market.
Shah said that compared to other video-editing tools, InVideo has a simpler interface for creating AI-generated videos. While some competitors are targeting filmmakers, ad agencies, and sales and marketing teams, InVideo wants to target individuals, creators, and small businesses.
He noted that the company currently has 4 million monthly active users, and the tool has generated 7 million videos in the last 30 days.
InVideo’s logic for using AI to generate videos is similar to that of its competitors. Anyone can use their phones to capture some footage and use editing software to make a video. However, video editing apps adopting AI features want users to imagine more expansive videos and possibly spend more money for generative AI features.
The company raised its last round of $35 million from firms like Greenoaks, Tiger Global, and Peak XV, which has a board seat in the company,  in 2021. Shah mentioned that the startup still has $25 million in the bank and is “hardly burning any money.”
“I think InVideo v3.0 is a big audacious step towards our purpose. We have a lot of investor interest, but we will look to partner with the right partner in the coming few quarters,” he told TechCrunch.
Shah added the company is on track to register $50 million in revenues this year."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/snapchat-will-soon-be-able-to-alert-parents-when-their-teen-leaves-or-arrives-at-certain-locations/,Snapchat will soon be able to alert parents when their teen leaves or arrives at certain locations | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-11-14,"Snapchat is bringing enhanced location sharing to Family Center, its parental controls hub, the company announced Thursday.
Users have been able to share their location with others on Snapchat for quite some time now, but the new addition allows parents to get an alert from within the app’s Family Center when their teen departs from or arrives at designated locations — for example, from school. Before, parents had to find their teen on Snap Map or go to their profile to see where they were; this new capability makes it easier for parents to keep track as they can see their child’s location directly within Family Center.
The first time parents set this up, they send a request asking their teen to share their live location; notifications can be set for up to three locations on the Snap Map. So parents could get alerted when their kid leaves school, arrives at his piano lesson, and then leaves to go home.
With this new feature, Snapchat may be looking to take on Life360, which is a popular service that allows families to track each other’s whereabouts and receive updates when family members arrive at or leave specific locations.
“We’re adding travel notifications to Family Center to give parents more peace of mind knowing their teen has arrived at class, left sports practice on time, or even returned home after a night with friends,” Snapchat wrote in a blog post.
Parents will also soon be able to see who their teen shares their location with on Snapchat. In addition, Snapchat is going to start nudging users who are choosing to share their location with all of their friends on the app to review who they are sharing their location with.
Snapchat says more than 350 million people use Snap Map every month and that these new features will allow families to stay connected when they’re outside.
The new features announced on Thursday are rolling out over the coming weeks.
Snapchat first launched Family Center in 2022 to allow parents to gain insights into how their teens are using the social networking app. The company rolled out the hub in response to increased pressure from lawmakers who want social media apps to better protect young users on their services.
Since rolling out the hub, Snapchat has occasionally updated it with additional features to help parents protect their teens. However, parents may not even know that tools even exist. Earlier this year, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel revealed that 20 million teenagers use Snapchat in the United States and that only around 200,000 parents use its Family Center supervision controls."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/reliance-disney-complete-india-media-merger-valued-at-8-5-billion/,"Reliance, Disney complete India media merger valued at $8.5B | TechCrunch",Manish Singh,2024-11-14,"Reliance and Disney have completed their landmark Indian media merger, creating an $8.5 billion entertainment powerhouse in the country’s streaming and television markets.
The deal, proposed in February, brings together Disney Star with Reliance-controlled Viacom18 under a joint venture that will control about 85% of India’s streaming market and roughly half of television viewership in the South Asian nation, according to analysts.
Reliance, which has agreed to invest $1.4 billion in fresh capital, will control the joint venture, it said in a statement on Thursday. The conglomerate and its subsidiary Viacom18 will hold 63.16% of the venture, with Disney retaining the rest.
The deal marks a significant retreat by Disney from the direct control of one of its most important international markets.
“By joining forces with Reliance, we are able to expand our presence in this important media market and deliver viewers an even more robust portfolio of entertainment, sports content, and digital services,” Robert Iger, CEO of Disney, said in a statement.
The merged group will be India’s largest, with annual revenue of $3.1 billion. It combines streaming platforms JioCinema and Hotstar with more than 100 television channels, serving more than 50 million streaming subscribers, and will produce 30,000 hours of television content annually.
Reliance didn’t detail how it plans to integrate Hotstar and JioCinema and when those integrations will be live.
“With the formation of this JV, the Indian media and entertainment industry is entering a transformational era,” said Reliance’s managing director, Mukesh Ambani, in a statement. “Our deep creative expertise and relationship with Disney, along with our unmatched understanding of the Indian consumer, will ensure unparalleled content choices at affordable prices for Indian viewers. I am very excited about the JV’s future and wish it all the success.”
The joint venture also consolidates control of India’s most valuable media rights, including cricket properties such as the Indian Premier League, ICC tournaments, and domestic cricket, alongside global sports content like the FIFA World Cup and Premier League. Viacom18 has also signed deals with Warner Bros and NBCUniversal to license much of their catalogs for the Indian market.
Nita Ambani, Mukesh Ambani’s wife and a director at Reliance, will chair the venture, with media veteran Uday Shankar serving as vice chair. The leadership includes Kevin Vaz as head of entertainment, Kiran Mani leading digital operations, and Sanjog Gupta overseeing sports content.
Shankar is returning to Star India, which he led as CEO before leaving in 2020 following disagreements with Disney. Shankar later partnered with James Murdoch to launch Bodhi Tree Systems, a Qatar Investment Authority-backed media investment firm that injected over $525 million into Viacom18. Bodhi Tree owns roughly 16% of Viacom18."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/paypals-new-feature-will-let-you-easily-split-expenses-with-family-and-friends/,PayPal once again lets you pool money from others to pay for things together | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-14,"PayPal is launching a few features that let users in groups pool money with friends or family, to collectively pay for trips, travels, gifts, and anything else. The company is launching this feature in the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Italy, and Spain ahead of the holiday season.
“Re-launching” might be the more appropriate verb here: PayPal actually had a pooling feature in place before, imaginatively called “Money Pools.” This made its debut way back in 2017 — quite possibly as a response to faster-moving startups coming up with the idea first and gaining some significant traction on the idea. However, PayPal shuttered the service globally in November 2021. A PayPal spokesperson told TechCrunch the feature is returning “due to high customer demand.”
At the time, company did not fully explain why it shut down Money Pools, but it’s notable that by 2021 there were a number of competing alternatives that didn’t require all contributors to be PayPal users, which was one gating factor to Money Pools. It was also the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and PayPal was more focused on developing products for charitable donations, competing against the likes of GoFundMe. (We are asking PayPal for more details on why it decided to relaunch pools again now, and we’ll update with the details when and if we get them.)
In the new version of the service, users will be able to set up a pool from the PayPal app or the website. They can start by tapping on the new “Pool Money” option in the app menu. The option is also located in the “More Option” menu in the “Send/Request” tab.
Importantly, your friends or family members can directly add money to the pool through that link — even if they don’t have a PayPal account.
You can add the title, description, target date, and optional goal amount for the pool. These pools have a sharable link that you can send to your friends or family via text, email, WhatsApp, or Messenger.
The pool creator can track contributions from different invitees to the pool.  They can also transfer the funds to their account anytime to spend on travel, gifts, or experiences.
“Everyday life is all about connections, whether it’s chipping in for a group gift or planning a trip with friends and family. PayPal understands this and aims to make those moments easier. We’re excited to introduce a simple, no-cost solution for collecting and managing funds for group purchases, helping our customers navigate both the social and financial aspects of their lives with each,” John Anderson, GM, SVP of Consumer at PayPal, said in a statement.
Apps like PayPal, Venmo, and Splitwise have had ways to split expenses among a group of people. However, that feature is more useful when you have already paid a bill. The new pool feature is handy when you want to get money from people upfront before spending it on something.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/us-confirms-china-backed-hackers-breached-telecom-providers-to-steal-wiretap-data/,FBI confirms China-backed hackers breached US telecom giants to steal wiretap data | TechCrunch,Carly Page,2024-11-14,"The U.S. government has confirmed that hackers with links to China breached multiple U.S. telecommunication service providers to access the wiretap systems used by law enforcement to surveil Americans.
In a joint statement published on Monday, CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the FBI said they had uncovered “a broad and significant” cyber espionage campaign that saw PRC-affiliated actors compromise networks at “multiple telecommunications companies” in the United States.
CISA and the FBI did not name the breached organizations, but AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink), and Verizon are among the telecom providers whose networks were breached, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The WSJ reported that Chinese hackers had access to the networks “for months or longer,” allowing them to collect “internet traffic from internet service providers that count businesses large and small, and millions of Americans, as their customers.”
The U.S. government agencies confirmed on Monday that the breaches enabled “the theft of customer call records data” and “the compromise of private communications of a limited number of individuals.”
The agencies did not name the targeted individuals but said they “are primarily involved in government or political activity.” Reports said last month that hackers linked to China had targeted the phones of then-presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance.
The PRC hacking campaign also enabled the China-linked hackers — known as “Salt Typhoon” — to copy “certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,” according to the statement.
The FBI and CISA previously said they were investigating breaches by a China-backed hacking group inside several telecommunications providers but had not said whether any data was stolen or whether the hackers accessed the systems used to fulfill legal wiretap requests.
“The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) continue to render technical assistance, rapidly share information to assist other potential victims, and work to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector,” the agencies said. “We encourage any organization that believes it might be a victim to engage its local FBI Field Office or CISA.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/tessl-raises-125m-at-at-500m-valuation-to-build-ai-that-writes-and-maintains-code/,Tessl raises $125M at $500M+ valuation to build AI that writes and maintains code | TechCrunch,Ingrid Lunden,2024-11-14,"Many startups and larger tech companies have taken a crack at building artificial intelligence to code software. Now another new player is coming out of the shadows to throw its hat into the ring, with a mission to fix the many problems that will arise when humans and all those AIs are writing code together.
Tessl is building what it describes as an “AI native” platform that developers and their teams can use to create and maintain software, and on Thursday it opened up a waitlist for those interested in trying it out.
We say “is building” for a good reason: Tessl’s product has yet to launch, and the plan is to have it ready early next year. But the London-based startup is now sharing a bit more about what it’s doing with some financial fanfare: Tessl has quietly raised $125 million across a seed round and a Series A, both being announced for the first time today. The latest round is led by Index Ventures, with Accel, GV, and Boldstart participating. GV (Google Ventures) and Boldstart co-led the seed round.
TechCrunch has confirmed with multiple sources that Tessl’s post-money valuation is north of $500 million, specifically $750 million.
As you might have surmised, one reason why a company without customers or a shipped product is getting this kind of attention from top-shelf VCs is because of who is building it.
Tessl’s CEO and founder is Guy Podjarny, a developer whisperer of sorts. His last startup was Snyk, a cybersecurity firm that was last valued (in 2022) at $7.4 billion. Before that, he was the CTO of Akamai, a role he took after Akamai acquired his first startup, Blaze, which focused on speeding up website loading times.
“Podjarny is incredibly visionary and thoughtful about his business,” said Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas, the partner at Index who led the investment. “He’s very, very good [at understanding] developer communities and building developer-oriented businesses.”
Podjarny said in an interview that the concept for Tessl arose from his experience at Snyk.
Snyk focuses on detecting (and fixing) security vulnerabilities in code, and Podjarny observed that a similar issue was becoming more urgent with code and software interoperability overall — in particular because of the rapid expansion of code written automatically by AIs.
“What is AI doing to software development?” he recalled asking himself. The answer was: speeding it up, but also creating much more of it automatically. The process of maintaining and shipping updates to that code would compound the complexity and chances of systems breaking. This ends up having a lot of bad implications (security, uptime, cost, efficiency) for organizations. “The more that picture formed in my mind, the more I knew I would build this,” he said.
The startup’s name, Tessl, is a reference to “tessellation,” Podjarny said, as it aims to make sure that software and the code behind it fit neatly together, rather than exist in a messy, overlapping jumble.
Podjarny was cagey about what kinds of applications or code he envisions being built, or maintained, on Tessl. But it sounds like it will actually start small.
“We’re not sharing the full strategy yet on what that is,” he said of target applications or use cases. “I would say that we’re not starting with games. We’re starting with relatively simple software that allows us to build an end-to-end system that is more manageable for LLMs to generate, and more manageable for humans to specify. And we will evolve from there.”
The basic idea behind the startup goes something like this: Developers and their teams (which include product managers and others who don’t code) can provide specifications to Tessl in the form of natural language or code. Tessl will then write code to match those specifications.
Teams can test that code in a sandbox, where issues can be flagged and addressed, and continue to modify specs as needed. After that, Tessl can be automated to maintain that code to that specification. So if something else risks breaking because of the new code, Tessl will run remediation to identify and fix that.
It sounds like Tessl is not being conceived as a walled garden. Tessl will initially aim to support Java, JavaScript, and Python, and would add more languages over time, Podjarny added. And Podjarny said he’s talking to others who have built or are building AI coding assistants, with the idea that these other platforms’ work will also be maintainable using Tessl.
This means that while theoretically it will compete with the likes of Anysphere’s Cursor, Poolside, GitHub’s Copilot, Magic, Codeium, Augment, OpenAI, IBM, and many more, it could potentially also work with whatever a team is using.
Side note: Many of the startups in this list are also seeing valuations creeping into 10 figures, another reason why Tessl’s valuation here does not seem so out of kilter. Could this be yet another bubble or will some of these manage to justify the numbers they’re achieving on paper?
One reason why investors love the idea and are backing it is because of that extensibility. Maintaining code is something that has “a lot of signal” as being important right now, said Gonzalez-Cadenas. “But he’s building a system of record here,” he added. “Once you do that, there is a variety of opportunities.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/atlas-co-wants-its-web-based-mapping-tool-to-be-the-figma-of-geospatial-data/,Atlas.co wants its web-based mapping tool to be the Figma of geospatial data | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-11-14,"Startup inspiration can strike anywhere. But for Atlas.co*, a freemium browser-based, real-time mapping tool that’s being built by an Oslo, Norway-based team of (initially student) engineers, the realization that there might be a business opportunity in competing with expensive legacy mapping software hit the founders during class.
“When we took introduction class to GIS [geographic information system], half of the class wasn’t able to download it because their computer didn’t meet the requirements of the software,” Fredrik Moger, CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch. “That’s a barrier in general, right? And I think if you look … maybe 10 years back, Adobe kind of faced the same issue. And then Figma came on the field.”
Atlas wants to unlock the power of GIS data in a similar way, sidestepping the drag and cost of legacy software by offering a more flexible, user-friendly cloud-based collaboration platform and a software-as-a-service business model that starts at free and scales with usage.
Moger points to other cloud platforms — such as Airtable, Canva, and Notion — as also providing the type of collaborative template it wants to bring to doing cool things with GIS data. While, on the legacy mapping side, he name-checks Esri as the main GIS platform competitor.
Google Maps also offers a custom maps features and an API for developers wanting to embed rich interactive maps elsewhere. Though it’s not a full GIS platform. So it is unlikely to be fully featured enough for the B2B users Atlas is going after.
Typical users so far include people working in renewable energy development, urban planning, and real-estate, according to Moger. Journalists have also, perhaps unsurprisingly, been among its early users — as maps can be a powerful way to quickly convey information.
Running Atlas doesn’t require particularly powerful computer hardware, per Moger. Nor does software need to be downloaded and installed, as everything runs in the browser.
A tile rendering component the team built allows it to stream mapping data from its infrastructure to the user’s browser “very efficiently,” he suggests — and that in turn means no fancy hardware necessary.
On the user interface side, the goal is to maximize accessibility, too, by designing a clean and modern software experience that’s easy to pick up. “[What] we are doing with GIS is making it available for everyone,” he said. “I think everyone should be able to build interactive maps and spatial apps really, really easily.”
Atlas was founded in 2021 when the founders were still at university. They bootstrapped during the early phase of the startup, opting to drop out of jobs they had lined up for after university to focus full-time on the startup. They launched the platform in June on Product Hunt. They’ve had close to 20,000 sign-ups across 140+ countries, so far — mostly free users at this early stage, Moger confirms.
The main features currently include a builder tool that lets users build spatial maps and interactive dashboards. It supports data layering, too — where users can upload information to display on maps and use tools to visualize and style the data.
The software also provides spatial analysis tools for automating functionality such as proximity searches, data aggregation, and density analysis. Real-time collaboration is baked in as well, with support for things like real-time cursor display to help teams work together on compiling visual location data.
The startup has just closed a $2 million pre-seed round to keep developing the product. So hiring more engineers is top of the team’s to-do list as they focus on continuing to expand Atlas’ feature set.
Moger suggests there’s a growing need for geospatial data analysis visual and storytelling — including as a result of the climate crisis. (One topical example is satellite maps of Valencia, Spain, that have been doing the rounds in the wake of the DANA storm flooding disaster earlier this month, showing before and after shots.)
“With all the climate change that is happening, and all the actions we need to do to fight climate change, a lot of new industries actually need to work more and more with geospatial data,” he suggested. “They currently don’t hold the competence and the skills to work with existing tools. And [those are the] new users or industries that we want to target. That’s who we want to enable to use and work with spatial data.”
Moger explained that, whereas previously only one person on a target team might have served as the in-house GIS expert skilled in using legacy software, the goal with Atlas is to enable multiple team members to collaborate on geospatial data.
The funding is led by European climate-focused VC fund Pale Blue Dot. Other “high profile” investors in the round include Ben Lang (early employee and ex-community lead at Notion) and Andreas Klinger (ex-CTO and founding teamat Product Hunt).
Commenting in a statement, Joel Larsson, partner at Pale Blue Dot, said: “Atlas.co is a significant step toward making spatial data accessible for essential causes like climate action. We’re excited to support a team that views maps not only as data tools but also as catalysts for environmental and social change.”
*Not to be confused with 3D generative AI tool Atlas; Atlas the works benefits tool for global companies; Atlassian’s teams software Atlas; Boston Dynamics’ Atlas the humanoid robot; or VC Sequoia’s interactive map of European tech talent, to name a few of the myriad uses of “Atlas” the term in tech. So it might be time to retire this name, tbh."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/eplane-looks-to-ride-the-indian-governments-interest-in-air-taxis-with-new-14m-round/,ePlane looks to ride the Indian government's interest in air taxis with new $14M round | TechCrunch,Jagmeet Singh,2024-11-14,"Soaring private vehicle ownership and declining use of public and nonmotorized transport have created mounting traffic congestion in India, the world’s most populous country, which also struggles with relatively narrower roads and inadequate parking facilities in cities. New Delhi recognizes these challenges and has been exploring new ways to address them quickly.
Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, at an event in September, said that air taxis will soon be a “reality in India,” indicating the government’s interest in supporting the new transportation mode. The country’s aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, also recently framed rules for vertiports to set the ground for air taxis.
The ePlane Company is riding this wave.
The startup, founded by IIT Madras aerospace engineering professor Satya Chakravarthy in 2019, is building its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle, the e200x, several months after developing unmanned drones for cargo and camera applications. Chakravarthy has a strong pedigree: He is also a co-founder and adviser at Indian space tech startups, including Agnikul and GalaxEye, and at an Indian hyperloop-focused startup, TuTr Hyperloop.
Chakravarthy told TechCrunch that ePlane secured IPs in developing the intra-city commute and cargo-focused aircraft with reasonably slow fly speed and a compact wingspan of 8 meters, unlike typical air taxis with 12- to 16-meter wingspans. That will enable it to land in tighter spaces and make multiple short trips — up to 60 trips a day — on a single charge, he says. Commuters would reduce travel time by as much as 85%, at a cost of less than two times the fare they usually pay on an Uber ride, he claims.
Most eVTOL vehicles currently are multicopters similar to commercial drones, including air taxis carrying spokes and vertical rotors. Chakravarthy said that while this configuration is easier to develop and implement in the market, it does not cover longer distances with a single battery charge. ePlane chose a lift-plus-cruise configuration where the vehicle carries a winged architecture just like a typical plane but with vertical rotors similar to a drone.
“This configuration has been proven to actually be very reliable because we have redundancies in terms of the vertical rotors carrying the weight of the aircraft, while wings taken with their share of balancing the weight progressively so that we don’t have a loss of lift during the transition from a vertical takeoff and hover to forward flight,” he said.
The startup has also developed technology called synergistic lift, which uses vertical rotors even in forward flight to make wings compact enough.
Chakravarthy told TechCrunch that ePlane manufactures aircraft components at its IIT Madras facility, including airframe parts and designing seats and propellers. The startup outsources cells but assembles batteries for the aircraft at its facility to manage the aircraft’s center of gravity.
The startup aims to commercialize its electric air taxi in the middle to second half of 2026 after securing the required certifications from the Indian and global authorities and prototyping the aircraft in the first half of 2025, Chakravarthy told TechCrunch.
Ahead of testing the vehicle, ePlane has raised a $14 million Series B round co-led by Speciale Invest and Singapore’s Antares Ventures. The all-equity round also included participation from Micelio Mobility, Naval Ravikant, Java Capital, Samarthya Investment Advisors, Redstart (from Naukri), and Anicut. The round has valued the startup at $46 million post-money — over 2x its previous $21 million valuation.
The fresh capital will help ePlane, which has a workforce of over 100 people, secure global regulatory certifications and boost its commercialization efforts.
India’s success would help ePlane enter other markets, including the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Europe.
“We are working with a conviction that going forward, what’s good for India will be good for the world,” Chakravarthy said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/apple-faces-uk-icloud-monopoly-compensation-claim-worth-3-8-billion/,Apple faces UK 'iCloud monopoly' compensation claim worth $3.8B | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-11-14,"U.K. consumer rights group ‘Which?’ is filing a legal claim against Apple under competition law on behalf of some 40 million users of iCloud, its cloud storage service.
The collective proceeding lawsuit, which is seeking £3 billion in compensation damages (around $3.8 billion at current exchange rates), alleges that Apple has broken competition rules by giving its own cloud storage service preferential treatment and effectively locking people into paying for iCloud at “rip-off” prices.
“iOS has a monopoly and is in control of Apple’s operating systems and it is incumbent on Apple not to use that dominance to gain an unfair advantage in related markets, like the cloud storage market. But that is exactly what has happened,” Which wrote in a press release announcing the filing of the claim with the U.K.’s Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).
The lawsuit accuses Apple of encouraging users of its devices to sign up for iCloud for photo storage and other data storage needs, while simultaneously making it difficult for consumers to use alternative storage providers — including by not allowing them to store or back up all of their phone’s data with a third-party provider.
“iOS users then have to pay for the service once photos, notes, messages and other data go over the free 5GB limit,” Which noted.
The suit also accuses Apple of overcharging U.K. consumers for iCloud subscriptions owing to the lack of competition. “Apple raised the price of iCloud for UK consumers by between 20% and 29% across its storage tiers in 2023,” it wrote, saying it’s seeking damages for all affected Apple customers — and estimating that individual consumers could be owed an average of £70 (around $90), depending on how long they’ve been paying Apple for iCloud services.
A similar lawsuit — arguing Apple unlawfully monopolized the market for cloud storage — was filed in the U.S. back in March and remains pending after the company failed to get it tossed.
Responding to the U.K. suit, Apple spokesman Tom Parker sent a statement in which the company wrote: “Apple believes in providing our customers with choices. Our users are not required to use iCloud, and many rely on a wide range of third-party alternatives for data storage. In addition, we work hard to make data transfer as easy as possible — whether its to iCloud or another service. We reject any suggestion that our iCloud practices are anticompetitive and will vigorously defend against any legal claim otherwise.”
Apple claims its pricing for iCloud is similar to that of other cloud storage providers. Many of Apple’s customers use alternative storage options, it also suggests, noting that nearly half its customers are not paying for iCloud+, either because they do not need extra storage or don’t want to use its paid service.
The U.K. claim is being brought on an opt-out basis for U.K.-based consumers who are eligible to be included. Consumers who live outside the U.K. and believe they are eligible to be included must actively opt in to join the action.
Which spokesman Tommy Handley told us eligible Apple customers include “anyone who has ‘obtained’ iCloud services, including non-paying users, over the nine-year timeframe since the Consumer Rights Act came into force on October 1, 2015.
Handley also confirmed that the £3 billion compensation figure accounts for potential opt-outs, duplicates, and mortality.
Which is a nonprofit but the litigation is being funded by Litigation Capital Management (LCM), a major global litigation funder, which it says has committed to seeing the action through to the end.
At the same time, Which is urging Apple to resolve the claim without the need for litigation — by offering consumers their money back and opening up iOS to allow users “a real choice” for cloud services.
Commenting in a statement, Which’s chief executive Anabel Hoult said: “By bringing this claim, Which? is showing big corporations like Apple that they cannot rip off UK consumers without facing repercussions. Taking this legal action means we can help consumers to get the redress that they are owed, deter similar behaviour in the future and create a better, more competitive market.”
Assuming Apple doesn’t seek to settle out of court, the next stage for the litigation will hinge on whether the CAT grants permission for Which to act as a class representative for consumers and allows the claim to proceed on a collective basis.
There has been an uptick in class action-style competition suits against Big Tech in recent years following a wave of antitrust enforcements on both sides of the Atlantic that’s still playing out in terms of full outcomes and business impact.
In the U.K., Apple has also been targeted in a class-action style antitrust suit brought on behalf of developers last year, in relation to App Store fees.
Also last year, a separate U.K. suit targeted Apple and Amazon alleging price collusion.
This report was updated with comment from Apple."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/whats-doge-musks-new-political-appointment-under-trump-is-a-crypto-joke/,What's DOGE? Musk's new political appointment under Trump is a crypto joke | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-11-13,"President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that one of his top donors, Elon Musk, will co-lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. It’s a not-even-thinly-veiled nod to the popular Doge meme, depicting a cute Shiba Inu, which is also the inspiration behind the meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin.
The commission, which will advise Trump, isn’t an actual government department — those have to be affirmed by Congress. But Musk seems to have successfully turned a joke he made on X in August into an actual advisory role in the Trump administration.
Musk has been a known proponent of the Doge meme for years.
The meme itself is simple. It references a Shiba Inu, a breed of hunting dog from Japan. The dog, who’s named Kabosu, captured the internet’s hearts by being exceptionally cute, similar to other, older animal-themed memes like Grumpy Cat. Its owner, a kindergarten teacher in Japan, first posted a picture of Kabosu in 2010, but the Doge meme went viral in 2013 when people added multicolored Comic Sans-styled text to the photos, imagining a dog’s internal monologue in broken English. A picture of this Shiba Inu in a pile of autumn leaves might read something like: much leaf, very pile, many fall, such pumpkin spice latte.
The jokes were funny 10 years ago, but like any meme, these unfamiliar phrasings could only remain entertaining for so long. However, Doge maintained cultural relevance because, in late 2013, two software engineers created a new cryptocurrency as a joke and named it Dogecoin, a reference to the Doge meme.
For a cryptocurrency that was created to make fun of cryptocurrency itself, Dogecoin has taken on a life of its own, and in part, we have Musk to thank for that. He’s been a longstanding proponent of the purposeless coin, even announcing a Dogecoin-funded “DOGE-1 Mission to the Moon” via SpaceX. (It was initially planned to launch in 2022, but DOGE-1 has not yet gone “to the moon.”)
Musk also confirmed that Tesla owns some unknown amount of Dogecoin when he was sued for $258 billion for an alleged racketeering scheme designed to inflate the price of the cryptocurrency. (The lawsuit was dismissed earlier this year.) Musk toyed with Dogecoin at X, too, having briefly changed the company’s logo last year to be the doge meme — another move that resulted in a sharp boost in the price of Dogecoin.
Similarly, Dogecoin spiked by nearly 20% on Tuesday night after Trump announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
Musk’s meme-based antics aren’t new; see the 420 joke that was a part of the “funding secured” Tesla debacle, for instance. But for Trump, it’s a bit less expected.
The Republican Party has a history of embracing memes to their advantage. During Trump’s last presidential term, a popular meme dubbed Pepe the Frog became associated with the alt-right.
Created by comic artist Matt Furie in his 2005 comic “Boy’s Club,” Pepe the Frog is a cartoon character and embodiment of the “dudes rock” ethos — a shorthand for immature, yet not actively harmful activities among groups of young men (such as the “Boy’s Club” characters). For Pepe, that means he’s a carefree dude who just wants to smoke weed and play video games with his bros. Pepe probably does not know what a 401(k) is, and it’s doubtful that he owns a bed frame.
Most people who used the Pepe meme never knew about its origins; instead, they just saw a frog with various expressions that they could use to portray their emotions, from deep sadness to sheer delight. People felt a kinship with the meme, often adopting him as their avatar on various forums like 4chan’s /b/ board, which generates some of the most heinous content on the internet due to its lax rules and decades-long reputation for breeding chaos.
Pepe’s ubiquity on the web continued for over a decade. In 2015, the frog was the most reblogged meme on Tumblr. So when Trump announced his campaign for president that year, Pepe was still prevalent online. Because the meme is so divorced from the original context of the Matt Furie comic, the apolitical character became a de facto dog whistle signaling involvement in alt-right movements. Trump began to post Pepe memes that echoed his beliefs, as calls to “build the wall” on the country’s southern border with Mexico grew in the U.S.
For communities on the internet that had grown accustomed to portraying Pepe in Nazi gear or as a U.S. border patrol officer, Trump’s acknowledgment of their memes felt like an endorsement.
This escalated further when Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., shared a graphic mocking Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s pronouncement that Trump voters are “deplorables,” which included a version of Pepe as Trump. As a result, the embrace of the term “deplorables” grew and Pepe became synonymous with alt-right movements. In a TV interview where the white nationalist Richard Spencer gets punched in the face, he’s wearing a Pepe pin on his blazer.
Memes like Pepe function well as a political dog whistle because they seem innocent and already have proven their popularity. Yet what looks like images of sad frogs or happy dogs can be twisted into something darker. Though not all uses of the meme were intended to signal alt-right associations, the Anti-Defamation League ended up classifying Pepe as a hate symbol.
Pepe has since come around. Strangely enough, the frog is more associated with crypto and Twitch streamers than alt-right activism these days; the frog was even represented on signs in pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Doge could now fall into the same trap that Pepe landed in, becoming a symbol of the second Trump administration and Elon Musk’s involvement in it. But as Pepe showed, a meme has the potential to be reappropriated and stretched into something new, over and over again. The unofficial, Musk-led DOGE office may not be the final fate of Kabosu the Shiba Inu."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/apples-ai-powered-final-cut-pro-11-is-now-available/,Apple’s AI-powered Final Cut Pro 11 is now available | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-13,"It’s been 13 years since Apple released Final Cut X. That’s just over half of the video-editing software’s entire lifespan, having celebrated its 25th birthday this April. It’s several lifetimes in the world of consumer software, leading some to wonder whether the company had quietly washed its hands of the offering.
After 13 years of waiting, Final Cut Pro finally goes up to 11, and now Apple is no longer mucking about. The software is available to download Wednesday. Existing users will get Final Cut Pro 11 as a free update, while new customers will have to shell out $300 to download it from the Mac App Store, following a 90-day trial period.
So, what, precisely, warranted the long-awaited jump to 11? Two letters: AI. Weeks after delivering Apple Intelligence to iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS, the company is tapping AI to power new features.
At the top of the list is Magnetic Mask, which easily crops people and objects out of video without having to rely on a green screen.
“This powerful and precise automatic analysis provides additional flexibility to customize backgrounds and environments,” Apple notes. “Editors can also combine Magnetic Mask with color correction and video effects, allowing them to precisely control and stylize each project.”
The other top AI-based feature here is Transcribe to Captions, which essentially does what it says on the box, adding text to Final Cut’s timeline. That feature is powered by an in-house large language model (LLM), according to the company.
The other big topline feature here is focused on Apple’s struggling mixed-reality headset. After adding the ability to capture Spatial Video on the latest iPhones, that content can now be edited with Final Cut. The footage can be color corrected, effects can be added, and the depth positioning of titles can be adjusted.
While CEO Tim Cook has admitted that the $3,500 headset isn’t the mainstream consumer product the company wanted, Apple is reported to be working on a more affordable model. The Vision Pro itself is capable of capturing Spatial video, along with the iPhone 15 Pro and all iPhone 16 models. Canon also recently released a new dual lens that will shoot the format on an R7 camera.
The new Final Cut introduces some time-saving features, as well. Magnetic Timeline, for instance, is a way to rearrange clips quickly, while keeping the audio in sync with video.
Apple says Final Cut Pro 11 was built specifically for its first-party silicon, the M-series of chips. That includes the ability to play back more simultaneous 4K and 8K ProRes video streams.
Along with the long-awaited arrival of Pro 11, Apple is releasing Final Cut Pro for iPad 2.1. The touched-based interface is getting enhancements to light and color, as well as an improved workflow experience. That’s also available starting Wednesday as a free download for existing users."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/openais-take-on-ai-agents-could-come-in-january/,OpenAI's take on AI agents could come in January | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-13,"OpenAI could release an “AI agent” tool as soon as January.
That’s according to Bloomberg, which reports that OpenAI is close to launching software, code-named “Operator,” that can take direct actions on a person’s computer. OpenAI is said to be planning to initially launch Operator as a research preview through its developer API.
Operator would go up against Anthropic’s recently unveiled agent feature, Computer Use, and Google’s rumored consumer-focused agent, among others. It’s unclear whether OpenAI’s will have any advantage; Bloomberg reports that it could take the form of a general-purpose tool that executes tasks in a web browser.
The report on Operator arrived the same day as the release of OpenAI’s policy paper with suggestions for the U.S.’ AI strategy. That paper reportedly proposes, among other things, that the federal government create AI-focused “economic zones” permitting work to build AI infrastructure, and the establishment of a bloc with U.S. allies to compete with China on AI."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/don-lemon-officially-leaves-elon-musks-x/,Don Lemon officially leaves Elon Musk's X | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-11-13,"Former CNN anchor Don Lemon said on Wednesday he is leaving Elon Musk’s X, a decision made less than a year after X announced that “The Don Lemon Show” would appear on the social media platform three times a week. That deal was canceled before it was ever signed, and Lemon sued Musk and X over it back in August.
Lemon pointed to X’s updated terms of service, which kicks in on Friday and states that all disputes with the company must be handled in a northern Texas court.
“As The Washington Post recently reported on X’s decision to change the terms, this ‘ensures that such lawsuits will be heard in courthouses that are a hub for conservatives, which experts say could make it easier for X to shield itself from litigation and punish critics,’” said Lemon in a statement posted on X. “I think that speaks for itself,” he continued.
Earlier this year, X announced several video content partnerships with big names like former congresswoman and 2020 presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, sports commentator Jim Rome, and — most surprisingly — Don Lemon. It was part of a broader video push on X that still hasn’t quite panned out, roughly a year later. Lemon said at the time that he resonated with the free speech message that Musk was pushing.
Contract negotiations between X and Lemon fell apart before a deal was ever solidified. In the midst of negotiations, Lemon interviewed Musk to be the first guest on his new show, which was slated to appear on X, but also on YouTube and other platforms as part of the deal — it was never an exclusive partnership. Musk became visibly uncomfortable and upset during that interview, as Lemon prodded the billionaire about his reported ketamine usage, his opinions on DEI, and X’s content moderation.
“Don … Choose your questions carefully, you’ve got 5 minutes left,” said Musk at one point in the interview.
Shortly after that interview, Musk canceled the deal with Lemon. Semafor reported that Musk texted Lemon’s agent with the brief, but harsh message: “contract is canceled.”
From there, things only got worse. In August, Lemon filed a lawsuit in a federal court against Musk and X claiming he was tricked into a business arrangement under false pretenses. In September, Musk asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit, but the case appears to be ongoing."

The company announced a new “Partner Program” that lets creators monetizes their content beyond ad revenue.
Although creators can already monetize their podcasts on the platform, they are now being incentivized to publish a video component alongside their podcasts.
By paying podcast hosts based on how much engagement their shows receive, Spotify is borrowing a page out of YouTube’s book. The Google-owned platform pays creators billions of dollars a year in shared ad revenue.
The company will also start letting premium subscribers watch video podcasts without ads. Spotify says this change will allow listeners to access videos without interruptions, which means that people may be more inclined to watch more content on the platform.
Although Spotify is one of the main services for listening to podcasts, YouTube still has a massive lead in video overall. By giving listeners an uninterrupted viewing experience, Spotify is likely hoping that people will choose to watch video podcasts on its own platform, rather than YouTube.
Spotify says more than 250 million users have watched a video podcast on its platform ever since it launched the format back in 2022. The company also says that nearly two-thirds of podcast listeners say they prefer podcasts with a video component.
In addition, the number of creators publishing videos monthly on Spotify has grown by more than 50% year-over-year. Spotify also revealed that there are now more than 300,000 video podcast shows on its platform.
“By delivering a best-in-class video offering uninterrupted by ad breaks, combined with Spotify’s flexibility and ubiquity, we can provide an experience for your audience that is superior to any platform,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said in a blog post. “And by giving you, the creators, another path to monetization beyond ads, we’re freeing you up to spend more time doing what you love: creating.”
The changes announced on Wednesday will go into effect on January 2, 2025, in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada. Eligible creators can apply to join the Spotify Partner Program to start monetizing their video podcasts.
As Spotify embraces video content, the company announced that it plans to add more video features, including chapters, comments, pinch-to-zoom, thumbnail scrubbing, and more. The streaming service is also making it easier to find video content by enhancing personalized video recommendations throughout the app.
Spotify also announced that creators can now upload clips directly to Spotify to promote their podcasts. These clips will appear in users’s Home feeds, Podcasts feed, Browse page, and the Now Playing view. The company says the addition isn’t mean to make Spotify “yet another place to watch short-form content,” and that it instead hopes these clips will help drive people to full-length episodes.
In addition, Spotify creators will now be able to choose thumbnails for their video podcasts, just like they would on YouTube. Plus, Spotify is redesigning its creator dashboard to make it easier for creators to see their performance and growth analytics."

The project, which was known by the codename “Encore,” evolved out of Amazon’s 2020 purchase of a startup called bluDiagnostics, which was developing a device that measured the levels of estradiol and progesterone — two of the hormones responsible for fertility in women — from saliva samples.
Amazon planned to release the product this year, but the team of approximately 100 people ran into technical challenges, according to the report. Encore was a part of Amazon’s Grand Challenge initiative, a secretive lab known for taking on bold or moonshot projects like cancer research.

The Meta founder met his wife, Priscilla Chan, at a college party where the song “Get Low” by Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz featuring the Ying Yang Twins was playing. As Zuckerberg wrote in an Instagram post, apparently he and his wife listen to “Get Low” every year on the anniversary of when they started dating. But this year, the swagged-out Zuck went above and beyond, collaborating with T-Pain to write an acoustic cover of the 2002 rap song.
It sounds exactly how you would expect — almost Weird Al-esque.
A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)
The song itself is pretty vulgar, which Zuckerberg acknowledges, wryly calling it a “lyrical masterpiece” in his Instagram post. The lewd lyrics are even more obvious when T-Pain and Zuckerberg slow down the tempo and deeply enunciate the lyrics while they strum their acoustic guitars. If you had told me an hour ago that I was about to hear a tech CEO sing the word “skeet” over and over, I would’ve guessed it had something to do with Bluesky. Not this.
For as cringeworthy as this “Z-Pain” collaboration is, it’s actually not bad considering what some other CEOs have done. Maybe it’s autotune, but Zuckerberg is actually on pitch when he sings. Meanwhile, venture capitalist Tim Draper once infamously sang a song about Bitcoin at Paris Blockchain week, in which he rhymed “Satoshi Nakamoto” with “Perfect-o.” Canva has commissioned choreographed songs about enterprise SaaS. Even Zuckerberg’s sister, Randi, once made a music video called “We’re All Gonna Make It,” a crypto anthem to the tune of Twisted Sister’s “We’re Not Gonna Take It.” And let us not forget the biggest revelation of Frances Haugen’s major Facebook leaks: the Facebook benefits enrollment musical, which takes place both on Zoom and in the metaverse.
With the image of metaverse avatars singing about dental insurance in your mind, is Z-Pain really so bad?"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/lawyer-allegedly-hacked-with-spyware-names-nso-founders-in-lawsuit/,Lawyer allegedly hacked with spyware names NSO founders in lawsuit | TechCrunch,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-11-13,"A lawyer who was allegedly hacked with government-grade spyware made by the infamous surveillance tech maker NSO Group has filed a complaint in court against two of the company’s founders and one executive. It appears to be the first attempt to hold the people behind a spyware company accountable for hacking crimes, rather than just the company itself.
On Wednesday, the Barcelona-based human rights nonprofit Iridia announced that it had filed a complaint in a Catalan court earlier this week accusing NSO’s founders Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio, as well as Yuval Somekh, an executive of two affiliate companies, of hacking crimes.
Iridia represents lawyer Andreu Van den Eynde, an attorney and university professor who specializes in cybersecurity. According to a 2022 investigation by Citizen Lab, a nonprofit that has been investigating government spyware for more than a decade, Van den Eynde was among the victims of a wide-ranging hacking campaign against at least 65 Catalans linked to the region’s attempts to become independent from Spain, which was carried out using NSO’s Pegasus software. Amnesty International independently confirmed Citizen Lab’s findings.
Van den Eynde and Iridia filed a lawsuit against NSO in a Barcelona court in 2022. Until this week, the lawsuit named NSO and Osy Technologies and Q Cyber Technologies, two Luxembourg-based affiliates of NSO as defendants. Today, the nonprofit and the lawyer asked the judge presiding over the lawsuit to expand it to include Lavie, Hulio, and Somekh.
“The people responsible for NSO Group have to explain their concrete activities,” a legal representative for Iridia and Van den Eynde wrote in the complaint, which was written in Catalan.
“Van Den Eynde was spied on to gain access to his clients and the legal strategy of the cases he was handling, creating a chain effect of rights violations: by spying on him, all his contacts were indirectly spied on,” Iridia wrote in a press release. “What is more, this surveillance is carried out without any criminal proceedings being brought against him and therefore without any judicial control.”
The complaint alleges that three executives were responsible for “selling illegal software” and participating and cooperating in the illegal use of the software.
Gil Lainer, vice president of global communications for NSO, told TechCrunch that the company has no comment.
Shalev did not respond to messages asking for comment. Lavie referred questions to his representative Hedan Orenstein.
“I understand that the plaintiffs are requesting to include Omri’s name as a defendant. But is there a specific allegation about an act attributed to Omri? They could theoretically ask to include both your name and mine as well,” Orenstein told TechCrunch.

Van den Eynde told TechCrunch that he is not happy to be a victim because he’d rather focus on his own work and interests in technology.
“The truth is that with all this Pikachu (I never mention the name of the spyware to make it harder when they leak my emails, lol) being a victim of the acts I try not to amplify this situation,” he said in an email.
Other victims of the alleged hacking campaign have put pressure on the Spanish government to disclose details of the alleged surveillance against them. In 2020, Motherboard first reported that the Spanish intelligence agency Centro Nacional de Inteligencia (National Intelligence Centre, or CNI) had purchased NSO spyware. The Spanish government at first denied the accusation that it was responsible for the alleged hacks against the Catalan politicians, arguing that it “doesn’t spy on its political opponents.”
The CNI said that its work was overseen by the Spanish Supreme Court and “in full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws.” Its former director Paz Esteban later testified in Spain’s Congress and said 18 members of the independence movement were spied on with judicial approval.
At the time he was allegedly hacked, Van den Eynde was representing several politicians of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia), who were involved in what Catalan politicians referred to as “el procés,” a catchall phrase referring to the independence movement, and the steps it took to attempt to have Catalonia secede from Spain. The most controversial of those steps was the independence referendum that the Catalan government called on October 1, 2017, which Spain’s constitutional court later declared as illegal.
There are several legal cases against NSO all over the world, including lawsuits in the U.S. launched by Apple and WhatsApp. Both cases are ongoing."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/wing-begins-delivering-blood-samples-via-drone-in-london/,Wing begins delivering blood samples via drone in London | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-13,"Alphabet X spinoff Wing on Wednesday confirmed that it has started delivering blood samples via drone. The program, announced in September, is shuttling samples between London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospitals.
Wing is running up to 10 deliveries a day, Monday through Friday. Each run can contain several different samples and takes around three minutes. The initial focus is on patients with potential bleeding disorders who are undergoing surgery.
Healthcare provides a huge potential market for the future of drone delivers. Past attempts have largely focused on providing goods for difficult to reach rural areas that are underserved by existing medical services.
Wing’s approach, however, brings the technology to one of the world’s great metropolises, where gridlock provides its own hurdles for fast and safe deliveries.
“We’ve been thrilled to see so much excitement around these patient-first operations as we’ve completed our final validations and have started delivering blood samples that doctors will use to make clinical decisions for their patients,” Wing notes. “From introducing our aircraft and way of operating at community events to meeting the NHS professionals who have quickly integrated drone delivery into their daily logistics, we’ve felt the warm welcome in South London.”
Amazon — which runs one of Wing’s biggest competitors, Prime Air — began delivering same-day medication delivery in select U.S. markets in October 2023. Expanding into additional markets has been slow going, however, as companies have been navigating regulation in both healthcare and commercial airspace."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/this-generative-ai-startup-is-strapping-cameras-to-peoples-backs/,This generative AI startup is strapping cameras to people's backs | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-13,"A startup is training an AI system that it claims will enable creators to generate cinematic worlds, with complete control over the scenery, characters, lighting, and motion. How? By having humans strap cameras to their backs and hike around the world.
Odyssey, founded by self-driving pioneers Oliver Cameron and Jeff Hawke (Cameron was previously the VP of product at Cruise), says it’s created an “advanced camera capture system” that can collect data just about anywhere a person can reach. Weighing about 25 pounds, the system packs six cameras, two lidar sensors, and an inertial measurement unit.
Bearing a resemblance to Google’s Street View Trekker, the system can capture its surroundings in “3.5K resolution” and 360 degrees, with “physics-accurate” depth information metadata attached.
So what’s the point? Well, Odyssey says it’s taking data from the system and feeding it through algorithms to “capture the fine details that make up our world.” Essentially, the company’s generating digital reconstructions of real-world scenes à la Meta’s Hyperscape project — scenes with forests, caves, trails, beaches, glaciers, parks, buildings, and so on.
Now, it’s not totally clear how these reconstructions will translate to better generative tools for creatives. Cameron and Hawke have previously said that Odyssey has developed several generative AI models that create layers of visual detail, including object geometry, lighting, and motion, and then combine these into a single virtual “world” to create desired scenes.
Even the best “world models” today have limitations, however — and Odyssey doesn’t claim to have solved all these. Nevertheless, it’s securing cash to forge ahead.
Odyssey today announced that it raised $18 million in a Series A funding round led by EQT Ventures with participation from GV and Air Street Capital. The new money, which brings the company’s total raised to $27 million, will be put toward scaling up Odyssey’s data collection operations in California.
Odyssey plans to expand its data collection to other states and countries in the future — with privacy protections in place, one would hope. (Google’s Street View team, for one, has found itself in the crosshairs of regulators for capturing images of public places that violated bystanders’ privacy.)
“We think it will be impossible for generative models to generate Hollywood-grade worlds that feel alive without training on a vast volume of rich, multimodal real-world 3D data,” the company wrote in a post on its blog. “We believe an advanced generative world-building model will unlock a better way to create film, games, and more.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/stepful-raises-31-5m-to-address-healthcare-staffing-shortage-with-ai-powered-training/,Stepful raises $31.5M to address healthcare staffing shortage with AI-powered training | TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,2024-11-13,"Carl Madi spent a chunk of the last decade working for Uber and Handy, an online marketplace for cleaners. “I spent a lot of time convincing drivers, handyman, and cleaners to join the gig economy,” he told TechCrunch. But when the pandemic struck, he saw many people lose their jobs overnight.
He noticed that there was a significant shortage of medical assistants, a career that was recession-proof and provided attractive pay and benefits. So, Madi (pictured above in the center) wondered if he could help cleaners become medical assistants.
“When I looked into it, I realized that most pathways are either trade schools or community colleges,” he said. “They can take up to two years and cost up to $20,000.”
In 2021, he teamed up with Tressia Hobeika (pictured left), who had previously worked at Udacity, and ex-Apple engineer Edoardo Serra (pictured right) to found Stepful, an AI-powered online program that trains people for entry-level healthcare jobs like medical assistants and pharmacy technicians in four months at an average cost of $2,500.
Since then, Stepful has grown from having only 50 students in its first year to expecting 30,000 enrollees in 2024.
Madi says students like the fact that Stepful balances flexibility with structure. Although students can do a lot of their learning asynchronously and in bite sizes on their phones, they must attend a weekly instructor-led class and work in groups. “It’s a much more engaging way of learning,” Madi said.
After completing the online coursework, Stepful automatically matches students with one of its 8,000 partner clinics or hospitals throughout the country for one or two months of hands-on training.
Since there aren’t enough healthcare workers, employers are eager to train these students, according to Madi. “What they say is, ‘let’s host these students. We can train them, and then if we like them, we will hire them,’” he said.
The company also boasts a 75% graduation rate, which Stepful achieves by having its AI send personalized messages to students who are falling behind. And if that doesn’t help get people back on track, a human coach intervenes to provide additional motivation. “People feel that they’re supported, nurtured, and we see them,” Madi said.
Students seem to like the education Stepful offers them, but they aren’t the only ones who are flocking to the company. On Wednesday, Stepful announced that it raised a $31.5 million Series B led by Oak HC/FT with participation from Y Combinator, Reach Capital, AlleyCorp, and others. The funding comes less than nine months after Stepful raised its $12 million Series A.
“We have seen that there’s a huge demand for allied health professionals,” said Vig Chandramouli, a partner with Oak HC/FT. In fact, the U.S. healthcare system is projected to soon be short of 3.2 million workers, including allied health professionals such as medical technicians and assistants, as well as nurses and mental health professionals, according to the American Hospital Association.
Oak HC/FT has looked at other startups that help solve the healthcare worker shortage but found that staffing companies like Nomad Health have narrow gross margins and don’t help to increase the supply of professionals, Chandramouli said.
“What we liked about Stepful was that it is taking people who are hourly workers, in most cases, and getting them into the healthcare field where they have steady salaries and proper benefits,” he said. “They are also clever in how they’re leveraging generative AI.”
In other words, by relying on GenAI, Stepful ensures that its metrics look more like a tech business with much fewer humans in the loop than a regular education program."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/spotify-teases-a-super-premium-tier-for-superfans-and-upcoming-video-expansion-in-q3-earnings-call/,Spotify teases a 'super premium' tier for superfans and upcoming video expansion in Q3 earnings call | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-11-13,"Spotify CEO Daniel Ek has once again teased the company’s long-delayed HiFi or “super premium” tier, a higher-qualify subscription offering the streaming service first announced in 2021 and then failed to roll out.
In the company’s third-quarter earnings call with investors on Wednesday, the exec suggested that such a product was still on the way, while touting the company’s near-term advances in other areas, including a coming expansion of its video offerings and other products enhanced by AI.
The streamer several years ago first announced plans to roll out a more deluxe version of its Premium subscription that would include features like “CD-quality, lossless audio” and more, but licensing issues led to a delay, Ek explained in 2022.
That didn’t stop Spotify from bringing up the offering to investors in subsequent quarters. In July, for instance, Ek said Spotify was planning to introduce an upgraded version of its subscription that would cost around $17 to $18 per month, or roughly $5 more than the current Premium tier. At the time, he noted the plan would give users more control over their music in addition to better audio.
Since both Apple Music and Amazon Music have provided lossless audio streaming for years, it’s been unclear why Spotify has held back for so long on its launch. While some speculated features like AI playlists might ship with a more deluxe tier, Spotify rolled out that tool to its Premium subscribers earlier this year instead.
In more recent months, it seemed that Spotify had expanded its focus for its deluxe offering to include more than video.
Billboard reported this year that major record label UMG was working with Spotify to create a subscription tier aimed at super fans, which could include things like early access to new music. The news followed Spotify’s expanded partnership with UMG, announced in March, that would offer artists more promotional tools and improved distribution, as well as access to music videos. In addition, a UMG investor presentation noted that 20% of streaming subscribers would be willing to pay for a combination of early access to music, plus higher-qualify audio and listening party invites.
Investors on the Q3 call brought up this superfan-focused tier again, and Ek said the coming higher-priced tier would include better sound quality and, vaguely, “a bunch of other things.” He also referenced the idea that catering to superfans would be part of the subscription’s draw.
“The principle for us is always the same, which is how do we create something that consumers love, but that also delivers value back to creators. And you can go back to vinyl buyers, you can go back to all of these superfans that already exist to look for clues in what some of the things are that they value.”
Ek declined, however, to speak to what role Spotify might play concerning music labels’ own efforts around “superfan” apps, saying only that if those apps generated great consumer appeal, Spotify would be “happy to look at ways to contribute to that growth.”
On the call, Ek also promoted the company’s creator-focused event this week in LA which will include announcements about its expansion of video on the platform. At the event, Spotify will introduce its efforts aimed at helping creators who want to be on more platforms gain access to Spotify’s audience as well as incentivize others to bring their full breadth of offerings over to Spotify. This is likely tied to a fall Bloomberg report that said Spotify was courting video creators with seven-figure deals to bring their content to Spotify.
In response to questions about AI, Ek touted the success of Spotify’s AI DJ feature which, alongside video, had been a standout initiative driving engagement that grew beyond just small, individual cohorts as many of its product launches do. Still, he cautioned that Spotify’s investment in AI would be disciplined, and used to drive engagement or increase retention, rather than simply being “reckless spending.”
The company’s shares rose more than 10% on Wednesday morning after the company announced it had added slightly more subscribers than expected in the quarter and presented bullish forecasts for Q4. Monthly users topped 640 million, and the company reported operating income of €454 million on revenue of €4 billion, up 19% from the year-ago quarter."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/this-week-in-ai-anthropics-ceo-talks-scaling-up-ai-and-google-predicts-floods/,This Week in AI: Anthropic's CEO talks scaling up AI and Google predicts floods | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-13,"Hiya, folks, welcome to TechCrunch’s regular AI newsletter. If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here.
On Monday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei sat in for a five-hour podcast interview with AI influencer Lex Fridman. The two covered a range of topics, from timelines for superintelligence to progress on Anthropic’s next flagship tech.
To spare you the download, we’ve pulled out the salient points.
Despite evidence to the contrary, Amodei believes that “scaling up” models is still a viable path toward more capable AI. By scaling up, Amodei clarified that he means increasing not only the amount of compute used to train models, but also models’ sizes — and the size of models’ training sets.
“Probably, the scaling is going to continue, and there’s some magic to it that we haven’t really explained on a theoretical basis yet,” Amodei said.
Amodei also doesn’t think a shortage of data will present a challenge to AI development, unlike some experts. Either by generating synthetic data or extrapolating out from existing data, AI developers will “get around” data limitations, he says. (It remains to be seen whether the issues with synthetic data are resolvable, I’ll note here.)
Amodei does acknowledge that AI compute is likely to become more costly in the near term, partly as a consequence of scaling. He expects companies will spend billions of dollars on clusters to train models next year, and that by 2027, they’ll be spending hundreds of billions. (Indeed, OpenAI is rumored to be planning a $100 billion data center.)
And Amodei was candid about how even the best models are unpredictable in nature.
“It’s just very hard to control the behavior of a model — to steer the behavior of a model in all circumstances at once,” he said. “There’s this ‘whack-a-mole’ aspect, where you push on one thing and these other things start to move as well, that you may not even notice or measure.”
Still, Amodei anticipates that Anthropic — or a rival — will create a “superintelligent” AI by 2026 or 2027 — one exceeding “human-level” performance on a number of tasks. And he worries about the implications of this.
“We are rapidly running out of truly convincing blockers, truly compelling reasons why this will not happen in the next few years,” he said. “I worry about economics and the concentration of power. That’s actually what I worry about more — the abuse of power.”
Good thing, then, that he’s in a position to do something about it.

Google claims to have developed an improved AI model for flood forecasting.
The model, which builds on the company’s previous work in this area, can predict flooding conditions accurately up to seven days in advance in dozens of countries. In theory, the model can give a flood forecast for anywhere on Earth, but Google notes that many regions lack historical data to validate against.
Google’s offering a waitlist for API access to the model to disaster management and hydrology experts. It’s also making forecasts from the model available through its Flood Hub platform.
“By making our forecasts available globally on Flood Hub … we hope to contribute to the research community,” the company writes in a blog post. “These data can be used by expert users and researchers to inform more studies and analysis into how floods impact communities around the world.”
Rami Seid, an AI developer, has released a Minecraft-simulating model that can run on a single Nvidia RTX 4090.
Similar to AI startup Decart’s recently released “open-world” model, Seid’s, called Lucid v1, emulates Minecraft’s game world in real time (or close to it). Weighing in at 1 billion parameters, Lucid v1 takes in keyboard and mouse movements and generates frames, simulating all the physics and graphics.
Lucid v1 suffers from the same limitations as other game-simulating models. The resolution is quite low, and it tends to quickly “forget” the level layout — turn your character around and you’ll see a rearranged scene.
But Seid and his partner, Ollin Boer Bohan, say they plan to continue developing the model, which is available for download and powers the online demo here.
DeepMind, Google’s premier AI lab, has released the code for AlphaFold 3, its AI-powered protein prediction model.
AlphaFold 3 was announced six months ago, but DeepMind controversially withheld the code. Instead, it provided access via a web server that restricted the number and types of predictions scientists could make.
Critics saw the move as an effort to protect DeepMind’s commercial interests at the expense of reproducibility. DeepMind spin-off, Isomorphic Labs, is applying AlphaFold 3, which can model proteins in concert with other molecules, to drug discovery.
Now academics can use the model to make any predictions they like — including how proteins behave in the presence of potential drugs. Scientists with an academic affiliation can request code access here."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/ever-wanted-to-rent-a-food-delivery-robot-now-you-can/,Ever wanted to rent a food delivery robot? Now you can. | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-13,"Good news for anyone who’s ever wanted to rent a delivery robot. Kiwibot this week announced a new “rent a robot” offering, making it possible for companies to use its army of autonomous delivery systems for a finite amount of time.
The robot-as-a-service (RaaS) approach follows the startup’s recent acquisition of advertising firm Nickelytics: Using the robots as mobile billboards is one of three options currently offered by the company.
Along with Kiwibot Advertising, customers can use the systems for warehouse logistics (Kiwbot Cargo) and the more standard last-mile delivery (Kiwibot Leap). The last option has long been the company’s central value add. Over the years, it has partnered with a number of universities for food deliveries.
Kiwibot notes that it has already partnered with AWS to pilot mobile advertising. It was a small pilot, with five robots over the course of a week, during Tech Week in New York City. Kiwibot Advertising is the only one of the three currently available through the company’s site.
Kiwibot Cargo is the odd one out here. After all, warehouse and logistics weren’t the company’s core competency. And besides, there are already a number of firms like Locus that have carved out much of the space.
From the sound of it, Kiwi is positioning Cargo as a more temporary solution to deal with labor issues. It’s certainly a subject on a lot of companies’ minds as we head into the holiday season.
“Services like Kiwibot Cargo come at a time when labor shortages have led top industry players to close down warehouse facilities and resort to efficiency rather than expansion,” the company notes. “By handling hazardous chemicals and overnight surveillance, among other tasks, Kiwibot’s Cargo robots provide some relief. These bots answer the calls for affordability and highly accurate results within these settings.”"

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/amd-lays-off-4-of-its-workforce/,AMD lays off 4% of its workforce | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-13,"AMD has confirmed that it’s laying off 4% of its workforce to focus on “large growth opportunities.”
It’s unclear how many workers have been impacted by the reduction — and which divisions. AMD had roughly 26,000 employees as of last year, according to the company’s annual 10-K filing. Four percent would translate to approximately 1,000.
“As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps,” an AMD spokesperson told CRN. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”
We’ve reached out to the company for more information and will update this piece if we hear back.
The news, which was previously reported by Wccftech, comes after a mixed Q3 earnings report. While AMD grew both revenue and profit, the company’s gaming division saw a 69% year-over-year decline, and guidance for the current quarter missed analysts’ expectations.
AMD has struggled to make progress in AI chip sales against rival Nvidia. A lack of inventory is one reason — by one estimate, AMD will ship 224,000 GPUs this year, a high volume, but not enough to satiate large customers like Microsoft and Meta.
AMD’s chips have also fallen short of what Nvidia’s can deliver in key AI training workloads, although AMD has positioned its offerings as the superior choice for AI inference (i.e. running models).
During the Q3 earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su tried to assure investors that the firm’s future chips will be highly competitive with Nvidia’s. “Our next-gen MI350-series silicon is looking very good, and is on track to launch in the second half of 2025, with the largest generational increase in AI performance we have ever delivered,” she said.
It’ll be an uphill battle. Consensus estimates have AMD’s 2025 revenues reaching $32.6 billion, up just $7.0 billion. Nvidia, meanwhile, is forecast to report quarterly revenues of $33 billion — virtually all attributable to AI chip sales.
AMD’s stock is down around 4% for the year."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/starfish-space-raises-29m-to-launch-satellite-servicing-spacecraft/,Starfish Space raises $29M to launch satellite-servicing spacecraft missions | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-11-13,"Starfish Space has closed a new tranche of funding led by a major defense tech investor as it looks to launch three full-size satellite servicing and inspection spacecraft in 2026.
The Washington-based startup’s Otter spacecraft is designed for two primary missions: extending the operational life of expensive satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO) and disposing of defunct satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO). It’s a series of capabilities that have never been available for satellite operators, who launch their satellites with the expectation that they’ll only have a limited span of useful life.
The aim, as Starfish CEO and co-founder Austin Link put it in a recent interview, is to “make it affordable enough that the benefits of having your satellite serviced outweigh the costs.”
The $29 million round was led by Shield Capital, a venture firm focused on funding technologies that will affect U.S. national security. It has participated in just a handful of other deals in the space industry. The round also includes participation from new investors Point72 Ventures, Booz Allen Ventures, Aero X Ventures, Trousdale Ventures, TRAC VC, and existing investors Munich Re Ventures, Toyota Ventures, NFX, and Industrious Ventures.
“You start a company because you want to build satellites, not because you want to fundraise,” Link told TechCrunch. Link founded Starfish in 2019 with Trevor Bennett after the pair worked as flight sciences engineers at Blue Origin. They raised $7 million in 2021 and $14 million two years later. Starfish launched its first demonstration mission, a sub-scale spacecraft fittingly called Otter Pup, last summer.
Although that mission did not quite go according to plan, Starfish has racked up several wins since then, including three separate contracts for full-size Otter spacecraft. That includes a $37.5 million deal with the U.S. Space Force for a first-of-its-kind docking and maneuvering mission with a defense satellite in GEO and a contract with major satellite communications company Intelsat for life extension services. The third contract, a $15 million NASA mission to inspect multiple defunct satellites in LEO, was announced while Starfish was in the middle of fundraising, Link said.
Starfish purposefully set out to find investors that had experience helping their portfolio companies navigate selling to the government, Link said. “The government is a customer that it sometimes can be harder to scale with, so having investors that understood the process a little better … we thought they’d be good additions to our cap table.”
Link added that the company is seeing a “fairly even split” in demand between government and commercial customers.
Satellite servicing, life extension, and satellite disposal are “exciting first steps,” Link said, but they’re stepping stones on the way to developing a broader suite of capabilities for even more ambitious missions on orbit.
“Along the way, we end up with this set of autonomy and robotics technologies and capabilities and datasets that allow us to go eventually do broadly a set of complex robotic or servicing or ISAM-type missions in space that maybe stretch a little beyond what we do with the Otter,” he said. “I think a lot of those are a long ways off, and not necessarily where our focus is right now … but some of the effort that goes into the Otter today and is funded through this funding round, and some of the growth there leads to a longer term where Starfish Space can have a broad impact on the way that humans go out into the universe.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/lyten-buys-battery-manufacturing-assets-from-beleaguered-northvolt/,Lyten buys battery manufacturing assets from beleaguered Northvolt | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-13,"Lyten, a Silicon Valley battery startup, announced today that it’s acquiring manufacturing assets from Northvolt, a Swedish battery manufacturer that’s facing a cash crunch.
As part of the deal, Northvolt is selling manufacturing equipment the company inherited in its 2021 acquisition of Cuberg, another battery startup. Lyten will also assume the lease of Cuberg’s old manufacturing facility in San Leandro, California. Lyten will invest $20 million next year to expand facilities in San Leandro and its existing operations in San Jose.
Neither Lyten nor Northvolt immediately replied to questions about the deal’s financial terms.
Unlike many other battery manufacturers, Lyten isn’t relying on nickel, cobalt, manganese, or even iron for its cathode materials. Instead, it’s using cheap and abundant sulfur mixed into a graphene matrix. On the anode side, it doesn’t use any graphite, a material that faces export restrictions from China. The company says the combination results in cells that have greater energy density than nickel-manganese-cobalt flavors but are cheaper to produce than low-cost lithium-iron-phosphate.
Northvolt has been struggling lately. The company has struggled to scale up production of lithium-ion batteries, and it missed delivery of a large order from BMW, which nudged the automaker to nullify a €2 billion contract.
To conserve cash, the company announced in August that it would shutter research and development at the Cuberg site, laying off nearly 200 employees. Then in September, it said that it was laying off an additional 1,600 employees, about 20% of its workforce, and that it had halted two planned factory expansions.
It’s unclear whether that cost-cutting and deal with Lyten will be enough to help Northvolt get through the coming year. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Northvolt needs to raise nearly $1 billion to give it some breathing room; the company’s operations reportedly burn through about $100 million a month.
While Northvolt is on the skids, Lyten appears ascendent.
The San Jose-based startup is planning to break ground next year on a factory in Nevada with a planned capacity of 10 gigawatt-hours. When complete, the $1 billion facility will produce lithium-sulfur batteries destined for micromobility vehicles like scooters and e-bikes, and defense and space applications like drones and satellites. The company expects it to come online in 2027.
Lyten’s purchase of Northvolt’s Cuberg assets give it the equipment and space to produce up to 200 megawatt-hours of lithium-sulfur batteries in the Bay Area. That should give the company some revenue while it prepares its larger factory in Nevada.
Lyten has raised $476 million to date at a $1.17 billion valuation, according to PitchBook, including a $200 million round that closed last year."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/34-startup-out-of-this-years-top-40-startups-at-station-f-use-ai/,Almost all of this year’s top 40 startups at Station F use AI | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-11-13,"Every year, more than 1,000 startups join Station F, the iconic startup campus in Paris. As it can be hard to sift through 1,000 startup descriptions, Station F selects the 40 most promising startups and shares a list of what it calls the “Future 40.” The campus also invests in 10 of these startups (but never discloses that list).
The 10 startups it invests in participate in a program run by Station F itself or by a partner, such as Binance, LVMH, Meta, and Microsoft.
Station F’s flagship program is the Founders Program. Companies apply to join this highly competitive accelerator program and be invited to workshops and classes to iterate rapidly on their projects and get to product-market fit as quickly as possible. Station F now takes a 1% equity stake in these startups.
But the startup campus also runs the Fighters Program, which is specifically designed for entrepreneurs with underprivileged backgrounds. It has also run vertical-specific programs in the past — such as the FemTech Program — when the Station F team believes startups in a specific vertical need additional support.
Startups in this year’s batch have already raised €93 million to date (a hair less than $100 million). While entrepreneurs tackle a variety of sectors, 34 of the 40 startups are using artificial intelligence. It’s clear that every new startup going forward will incorporate AI in some way.
Looking at this year’s Future 40 startups, some names stand out of the selection — such as Arago, a startup working on new AI-focused chips that use optical technology at the chipset level to speed up operations. Or EXXA, a startup that’s optimizing AI inference to bring per-token rates down.
Expect to see more startups focused on optimizing AI workloads now that innovation in AI model development is drastically slowing down.
Elsewhere, Altrove (a startup we previously covered) and Entalpic are both working on materials research. These are just two startups in a new wave of materials companies that have turned to AI to accelerate development.
In this year’s Future 40, there are also quite a few startups working on energy optimization. For instance, Optimmo is a remote companion that can help home owners improve the energy performance of a house or apartment with the most efficient retrofitting works. Kelvin is another interesting home energy retrofitting startup that we’ve already covered.
Orus Energy is a software solution that shifts energy loads to off-peak hours. With these optimizations, companies can save on costs and reduce their carbon footprint.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/apple-now-lets-app-developers-apply-to-be-featured-on-the-app-store/,Apple now lets app developers apply to be featured on the App Store | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-11-13,"App developers now have a new way to promote their app launches, updates, and other new features on Apple’s App Store. First announced at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Apple this week introduced a “Featuring Nominations” option in App Store Connect, which is the service developers use to submit their apps, games, and updates to the App Store. Now, instead of waiting for Apple to recognize their work, developers can nominate their own apps to be featured.
This will allow developers to inform Apple about three different types of updates: new content, app enhancements, or new app launches.
Ahead of the change, the App Store Editorial team would create stories about apps and their developers as well as roundups of apps into collections that are highlighted across the App Store’s many sections and pages. However, there was no formal process to request consideration to be included in these featured positions, which can drive significant traffic to apps as consumers browse the App Store.
The new process will likely become a key step in developers’ ongoing marketing and promotional efforts for their apps, games, and other updates.
To use the “Featuring Nominations” option, developers will access a nominations dashboard in App Store Connect where they can enter nominations one by one. For larger publishers, the ability to upload a spreadsheet to nominate apps or games in bulk will be useful. Apple suggests using a memorable name for the nomination that will help its App Store Editors understand what the app’s new content or feature is focused on.
In addition to the update’s name, developers should include a text description that explains the relevant details about the update and the expected publish date. In another field, “Helpful Details,” developers can also add other relevant information about the submission, like the developer’s story, how they created the app, or some other key factor they want Apple to take notice of, like accessibility improvements or use of new developer tools, perhaps.
If the App Store Editorial team selects their app for featuring, developers will then receive a notification from App Store Connect. They can tap on this notification to be taken to a page where they’ll be able to take advantage of new Promote Your App marketing assets that will make it easy for them to quickly capitalize on their featured position by sharing the news across social media and other marketing challenges.
Apple says it will also provide marketing materials for other big moments in an app’s lifecycle, like when it first launches or releases a new version. Apple’s marketing assets will include a provided link that will direct consumers to download the app or game from the App Store.
The feature will not only make it easier for App Store’s Editors who are already involved with curating app launches and updates to make the App Store always seem to have fresh offerings, but it will also benefit developers and consumers who are looking to discover the latest content, updates, and new releases. Plus, featured updates could help pull consumers back into apps they may have otherwise forgotten about — something Google Play recently addressed with its Collections feature designed to drive users back to apps to complete purchases, stream media, place orders, engage with social media, and more."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/amazon-takes-on-temu-and-shein-with-discount-amazon-haul-store/,Amazon takes on Temu and Shein with discount 'Amazon Haul' store | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-11-13,"Amazon has rolled out its answer to the discounted, low-cost storefronts of Temu and Shein. The Amazon Haul store, currently available on the mobile app or mobile web browser exclusively, offers similar mass-produced, discounted items, most of which ship from China. It’s a departure from Amazon’s long-established reputation as a powerhouse of rapid delivery times since even Amazon can’t reduce the time it takes to get these overseas goods.
The landing page for Amazon Haul is reminiscent of Shein and Temu even in its design: Items appear in grids, rather than Amazon’s typical list, and shipping times and star ratings aren’t visible unless you click on an item. Some items are labeled with rocket ship emojis that warn that this $4.99 iPhone 16 Pro case is “selling fast!” Or, you might see a fire emoji declaring that the price for a three-pack of $2.89 mesh laundry bags is “crazy low.” Like its competitors, Amazon Haul also sells clothing ($16 for a pair of men’s golf pants, or $4.99 for 80s-style women’s leg warmers). In a “Staples” section, you can find an assortment of… sponges, resistance bands, hoodies, silicon baking mats, and socks.
“While Amazon continues to offer over 300 million items with fast, free delivery for Prime members […] we also hear from customers that sometimes they would love to shop ultra-low-priced products even if some of them take one to two weeks to arrive,” Amazon wrote in a blog post.
Temu and Shein have been subject to wide criticism over their environmental impact, a byproduct of their worldwide shipping, and the waste caused by fast fashion. Both companies have also been subject to consumer protection probes in the European Union, where regulators are investigating their potential use of addictive design patterns and illegal products.
Despite the controversy surrounding them, these low-cost retailers remain incredibly popular among Gen Z. According to research from app intelligence firm Appfigures, the most popular app among U.S. users ages 18 to 24 was Temu, with almost 42 million downloads in that demographic between January and October 2024. For Shein, that estimate is about 14.7 million downloads, though it’s possible that the difference in download numbers is that stark because Gen Z users have already downloaded Shein, which has been around longer than Temu.
One risk for Shein and Temu is that consumers may not feel comfortable making purchases from unknown sellers that could potentially be misleading; consumers have more existing trust in Amazon, but the company is working with similar, largely China-based sellers of mass-produced goods. However, Amazon claims that it screens sellers ahead of time, and if customers want to return their purchase, they can do so for free within 15 days as long as the item is over $3.
It’s a dubious time for Amazon to invest in this business model, given that president-elect Donald Trump has proposed leveraging a 60% tax on imported Chinese goods. This tariff plan isn’t set in stone, though — it’s common for politicians to shift their campaign platforms after they’ve secured a win.
However, the popularity of Chinese e-commerce shipments has attracted bipartisan attention. The Biden administration has already proposed congressional action to crack down on what it calls “significant increased abuse” by Chinese e-commerce companies of the “de minimis” exception. The de minimis exemption allows shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty free, which helps retailers like Temu and Shein maintain such low margins."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/hot-topic-data-breach-exposed-personal-data-of-57-million-customers/,Hot Topic data breach exposed personal data of 57 million customers | TechCrunch,Carly Page,2024-11-13,"Millions of customers of Hot Topic have been informed that their personal data was compromised during an October data breach at the American retailer.
Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), the breach notification service, said this week that it alerted 57 million Hot Topic customers that their data had been compromised.
The stolen data includes email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, purchases, genders, and dates of birth. Partial credit card data was also included in the breach, according to HIBP, including credit card type, expiry dates, and the last four digits of the card number.
Hot Topic, which has more than 640 stores across the U.S., has not yet confirmed the breach and did not respond to TechCrunch’s multiple requests for comment.
The breach occurred on October 19, according to HIBP, and was claimed by a threat actor operating under the alias “Satanic” on October 21. In a post on the cybercrime forum BreachForums, Satanic claimed to have stolen 350 million user records from Hot Topic and its affiliated brands, Box Lunch and Torrid.
The hacker initially attempted to sell the database for $20,000 and demanded a $100,000 ransom from Hot Topic to take down the information, according to a report by cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock.
In the post on BreachForums, seen by TechCrunch, Satanic is now offering the database for $3,500.
The nature of the security incident that led to the breach is unknown. According to a report from Hudson Rock, the threat actor may have leveraged credentials stolen via infostealer malware to steal credentials for an analytics platform used by Hot Topic to access the retailer’s cloud environments.
It doesn’t appear that Hot Topic has yet notified customers or state offices of attorneys general about the data breach."

As part of that process it’s launched a consultation (here) seeking input in two areas. The first is how the law defines AI systems (as opposed to “simpler traditional” software). It’s asking people in the AI industry, business, academics, and civil society for views on the clarity of key elements of the Act’s definition, as well as examples of software that should be out of scope.
The second ask is around banned uses of AI. The Act contains a handful of use cases that are prohibited as they’re considered “unacceptable risk,” such as China-style social scoring. The bulk of the consultation focuses here. The EU wants detailed feedback on each banned use, and looks particularly keen on practical examples.
The consultation runs until December 11, 2024. The Commission then expects to publish guidance on defining AI systems and banned uses in early 2025, per a press release."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/nokia-acquires-rapid-the-api-company-once-valued-at-1b/,"Nokia acquires Rapid, the API company once valued at $1B | TechCrunch",Ingrid Lunden,2024-11-13,"Nokia, once the world’s biggest mobile phone company but now mainly a provider of infrastructure and services to carriers, has made an acquisition in its bid to be a bridge between the worlds of tech and telecoms. It’s acquiring Rapid, formerly known as RapidAPI, a startup that operates an API marketplace. Nokia will be integrating Rapid into a platform it’s building to help 5G operators open their networks to more developers.
Financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed in the official announcement. Rapid was once valued at $1 billion and counted as many as 4 million users tapping into some 40,000 APIs, but it’s seen a significant decline in its business in the last couple of years. The companies are not disclosing Rapid’s active users as of today except to note that it is a number in the thousands, and that APIs are in the hundreds. As Nokia is publicly traded, more financial details may come through in a future filing. (Update: some have conjectured that the deal could be for as little as $100 million.)
The deal will include a public marketplace, enterprise services, and an enterprise-grade API hub designed for building, testing, and sharing APIs internally and externally; and Nokia is pitching it as a move to help carriers work more easily with developers.
“Operators need a bridge to connect to thousands of developers to drive enterprise and consumer value creation and monetize their networks,” said Raghav Sahgal, president of Cloud and Network Services at Noka, in a statement.
On Rapid’s side, the landscape for technology has shifted drastically over the last couple of years, and many later-stage startups have found it challenging to meet the lofty forecasts they had set while raising big funding rounds in more buoyant years. Rapid’s $1 billion valuation was based on a funding round from 2022.
Rapid rose to prominence amid a boom of interest in APIs a decade ago, when APIs were first emerging as the webbing between businesses and developers building services around them. Rapid’s pitch was that it provided a one-stop place to find and use APIs in what appeared to be a very fragmented market.
But it’s not clear that Rapid found a route to profitability in providing that service. Rapid’s founder Iddo Gino (a wunderkind who started the company aged just 17 in 2015), stepped down as CEO in April 2023, replaced by Marc Friend, and in the weeks following, the startup saw at least two major rounds of layoffs that reduced headcount by 82% (cue headlines of the company’s “Rapid descent“).
Rapid, based out of San Francisco, had raised nearly $273 million in venture funding from big-name investors that included Andreessen Horowitz, Microsoft, and SoftBank, among others.
It’s not clear how many people are actually at Rapid as of now, nor how many would be joining Nokia in the deal. Nokia’s statement emphasizes product more than people, noting that it is acquiring “technology assets, including the world’s largest API hub used by thousands of active developers globally, and its highly skilled research and development unit.”
For Nokia, the acquisition is an interesting and slightly ironic turn given the Finnish company’s history as a pioneer in the world of mobile.
Back in the 1990s, Nokia set the pace for building mobile networks around the world, and alongside that, it became the world’s No. 1 handset maker.
In the first decade of the 2000s, however, it missed the boat in the shift to smartphones, which became dominated by Apple and Google (and Samsung and the hundreds of others building on Google’s Android operating system). Some argued that one of Nokia’s biggest failings was its inability to establish an extensible ecosystem for apps and third parties (and developers) to build for its smartphones. So it’s interesting that it is now positioning itself as an enabler for that very purpose.
Specifically, Nokia sees an opportunity for carriers to encourage more developments on costly 5G networks that are now in place but in many cases underutilized.
Carriers, they say, want more third parties building applications and other services on these networks, and they have launched a new “Network as Code” platform to that end. Rapid’s API framework will exist as part of that initiative. Nokia said that carriers and other service providers signed up to the platform include BT, DISH, Google Cloud, Infobip, Orange, Telefonica, and Telecom Argentina, as well as 20 others.
“We are pleased to join forces with Nokia,” Friend, the CEO of Rapid, said in a statement. “The combination of Rapid’s API technology and R&D expertise with Nokia’s scale and network and API domain expertise will enable us to expand the broader API ecosystem.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/leland-lands-12-million-to-grow-its-coaching-platform/,Leland lands $12 million to grow its coaching platform | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-13,"Coaching platform Leland has raised $12 million in Series A funding led by Forerunner Ventures with participation from GSV ventures to grow its platform geared toward matching coaches and aspirants to fulfill goals ranging from getting into a university to passing an entrance exam and excelling at product management. The company aims to build better tools for coaches to create content and manage their schedules, as well as build out its enterprise offering.
The startup was founded in 2021 by John Koelliker, a former product manager at marketplaces including Uber and LinkedIn. It has raised $17.1 million in funding to date, with investors including Goodwater, FJ Labs, Next Play Ventures, and a few LinkedIn executives.
Since the company raised its last round in 2022, it has experienced steady growth, with its revenue increasing fourfold in the past year. The company said it had conducted over 50,000 coaching sessions on the platform in the last 12 months. Leland currently has more than 100,000 users from 70 countries who are accessing coaching, courses, and events.
Koelliker noted that the company didn’t need to raise the money as it was cashflow positive. However, it raised funds because the business was hitting an inflection point. The startup felt it had to invest more to grow.
The platform has more than 1,000 coaches across different categories. The startup says most of these coaches come to them organically after a friend or a family member tells them about the platform.
“We still have 75% organic growth because there is so much sharing within friends, family, and users’ networks. One of the counterintuitive things with Leland is that we have everything from dental school admission to software engineering coaching. While these are different paths, coaches in different sectors are often tightly networked, and that helps us build a strong supply and discovery side,” Koelliker said.
The company structures the onboarding process for coaches to ensure they clearly identify their areas of expertise. It also sends a vouch link to new coaches so people in their network can affirm that the coach has expertise in a certain segment.
While the platform’s core pitch is its network of coaches, it also has courses and events where people can take part in groups. Koelliker noted that Leland vets the supply of coaches strictly and has only a 5% acceptance rate to ensure that the platform only gets high-quality coaches.
Since raising its seed round, Leland has thought about building management tools for coaches, including better payments, messaging, scheduling, CRM, time tracking, reviews, and discount codes. The company thinks these tools can help coaches better monetize their expertise. The startup calls this tooling “business in a box” for coaches.
The company also offers an AI-powered tool for coaches that provides them with session summaries, action items, and key takeaways akin to meeting-intelligence tools like Read AI and Otter.
“We have tried to make packages and templates that coaches can use to slot their expertise and content. This makes onboarding easier for coaches and discovery better for users,” Koelliker said.
During onboarding, the platform uses AI to take a gist of a coach’s work experience and suggest attractive headlines and bios for their Leland profiles.
Koelliker noted that a lot of Fortune 500 companies offer Leland’s services and coaching sessions as a perk to their employees. The startup wants to bank on that and invest in its enterprise tooling to expand that area of business more.
The company is also experimenting with an AI-powered onboarding tool for end customers, who can describe their goals and get suggestions for appropriate coaches for those goals. What’s more, the startup is expanding the category of goals and coaches to reach a broader audience. It plans to use AI to help coaches develop interactive coaches adapted to a learner’s progress.
Eurie Kim, managing partner at Forerunner Ventures, said that, as a firm that invests in consumer tech, it wanted to invest in the area of career advancement and coaching for the longest time.
“We’re seeing younger generations deeply struggle to find purpose and direction in young adulthood, all while the job market becomes increasingly competitive and higher ed all the more expensive. Alongside this, AI has a clear opportunity to reshape how people learn, transforming what’s possible with personalization and efficiency,” she said.
Kim emphasized that Leland’s model of creating a marketplace with top-quality coaches, along with reviews and hands-on support, creates an opportunity for the startup to grow.
“Coaches benefit from advanced tools for running their business: built-in marketing, simplified back-end processing, and AI features for scale and efficiency. The referrals and organic growth that Leland is seeing already demonstrate network effects at work,” Kim added.
Leland competes in a tough market with other startups, like executive coaching company BetterUp; a16z-backed Intro, which connects high-profile experts to builders and founders; AceUp, which provides workplace coaching; Shimmer, a coaching platform for people with ADHD; and group-focused coaching company HumanQ."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/vecna-robotics-raises-14-5m-and-taps-former-motional-ceo-to-lead-startup/,Vecna Robotics raises $14.5M and taps former Motional CEO to lead startup | TechCrunch,Kirsten Korosec,2024-11-13,"Karl Iagnemma, an early pioneer in the autonomous vehicle industry who recently stepped down as president and CEO from Hyundai-backed Motional, is back in the AV and robotics game. Vecna Robotics, a Massachusetts-based startup that uses robots to handle materials in warehouses, has hired Iagnemma as CEO.
The robotics startup, which has developed autonomous pallet movers such as forklifts as well as software to help companies manage operations, also said Wednesday it has raised another $14.5 million in funding from existing investors. The startup said the funds will be used to accelerate its automation technology and improve its products for the automotive, general manufacturing, and high-volume warehousing industries. Vecna has raised $179 million to date.
Vecna, which is backed by Tiger Global Management, Proficio Capital Partners, Blackhorn Ventures, and Highland Capital Partners, to name a few, raised $50 million in 2020. Two years later, the company raised $65 million in a Series C round that was extended earlier this summer by $40 million in new funding, including equity and debt.
Iagnemma, who has dedicated most of his career to autonomy, told TechCrunch he sees a lot of opportunity for Vecna to scale commercially. He saw promise in that startup early on; Iagnemma was an angel investor in Vecna in 2020. Iagnemma compared automation logistics to the current state of robotaxis. “There is a massive market opportunity but little market penetration,” he said. “What I’m most excited about is the combination of Vecna having the best technology in the industry and the secular tailwinds around material handling and automation, specifically due to labor supply and increased labor costs.”
Iagnemma startled industry insiders in September when he left autonomous vehicle technology company Motional, which has been trying to commercialize a robotaxi service. The former CEO has had a long career in AVs, first in academia and later as a founder. Iagnemma directed the Robotic Mobility Group research laboratory at MIT for 10 years. During that time, he would meet Daniel Theobald, a fellow MIT alumnus and founder of Vecna Robotics. Iagnemma and Emilio Frazzoli founded the startup NuTonomy in 2013. Four years later, it was acquired by Delphi — now known as Aptiv — for $450 million. When Hyundai and Aptiv formed a $4 billion joint venture in 2019 called Motional to commercialize autonomous vehicles, Iagnemma took the top leadership role.
Motional has made progress but faced an existential moment earlier this year when Aptiv — the other half of the joint venture — said it would no longer allocate capital toward the endeavor. Hyundai stepped forward and in May agreed to invest another $1 billion into Motional. However, there has been a restructuring that included laying off about 550 people, pausing commercial operations, and delaying plans to launch a robotaxi service with its next-gen Hyundai Ioniq 5 robotaxis until 2026.
Iagnemma said he still believes in what Motional is working toward. “I actually think Motional is in a good spot,” he said. He acknowledged that while commercializing AV technology will still take some time, he thought Motional was poised to be a part of the burgeoning industry.
“If anybody thinks there’s only one winner in the space, that’s crazy talk,” he said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/patreon-gets-gift-subscriptions-in-time-for-the-holidays/,Patreon gets gift subscriptions in time for the holidays | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-11-13,"Creator subscription platform Patreon is making it a bit easier for fans to support their favorite creators this holiday season. The creator membership platform announced on Wednesday that it will roll out gift subscriptions, as well as functionality for creators to offer discounts for membership sign-ups.
The gift subscription feature had previously been in testing for select creators, but will now roll out for all creators.
According to Patreon, creators have historically seen the most significant increase in paid membership signups during the holiday season, between November and January. The gifting feature could make that bump more substantial since people will be able to give Patreon subscriptions as holiday gifts — for many memberships, this means unlocking exclusive access to bonus content, like extra podcast episodes, livestreams, or digital downloads. A creator who posts cooking videos might share additional recipes behind the paywall, for example. Creators who don’t want to give away content for free can instead opt to temporarily discount their subscription cost for new fans.
Patreon rolled out free memberships last year, allowing users to subscribe to a creator’s non-paywalled updates as though they’re an email newsletter. Over the summer, Patreon said that there have been 30 million new free memberships. Creators will be able to make gift links, redeemable by fans who aren’t currently paid members; if fans want to stay in the membership once the free period expires, this feature could help convert them to paying members.
Among streamers, there’s already a culture of contributing gift subscriptions to fellow fans — this feature is similar in nature to existing tools for streamers on Twitch and YouTube, where generous fans will randomly award “gift subs” to fellow viewers. Patreon gift subs, by nature, probably won’t see the same spontaneity as a Twitch creator’s livestream, but they could equate to something like sending your niece an Amazon gift card. That’s not too far-fetched an idea, considering how popular creators are among young people."

On Wednesday it described the market as a pillar for its investment business after the stellar listing of food delivery and quick commerce firm Swiggy netted it gains of $2 billion.
PayU, which is wholly owned by Prosus, had initially planned to list by this year at a valuation of between $5 billion and $7 billion. “We’re late into 2024 already, but we hope that it could be a 2025 event,” said Ervin Tu, Prosus’ president and chief investment officer, on a call with journalists.
The payment and lending firm recently emerged from a 15-month regulatory ban on new merchant acquisitions and received approval to operate as a payment aggregator in April. It competes with Razorpay and Walmart-owned PhonePe in India’s fast-growing digital payments market.
In a recent note to clients, UBS ascribed a valuation of $4.2 billion to PayU, up from $3.7 billion, driven by higher trading multiples among global payment peers. Prosus sold the global business of PayU last year.
Prosus, controlled by Naspers, is an investor in several late-stage Indian startups, including social commerce company Meesho and home services provider Urban Company. Its chief executive, Fabricio Bloisi, said more portfolio companies could go public within 18 months."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/fitbit-smartwatch-for-kids-ages-7-launches-family-group-chats/,Fitbit’s kids’ smartwatch gets family group chats | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-11-13,"Fitbit’s Ace LTE, the smartwatch designed for ages 7+, is introducing new features to help families stay connected and get active together.
On Wednesday, Fitbit announced a slew of new features, including group chats, family quests, a new mini-game, and two new watch faces. There’s also a new direct message feature for siblings to text and call each other using their devices.
Ace LTE, launched in May, is designed to provide parents with a sense of security. It allows them to text and call their kids, track their location, and monitor their activity level. The device restricts kids’ ability to add contacts. Instead, guardians can approve and add up to 20 trusted adults to the account, ensuring that communication stays in a controlled network.
A newly introduced feature enhances this experience by enabling a group chat function within the Ace LTE device and the companion Ace app. Anyone within the Google Family can be added to the chat.
Previously, siblings were unable to call or message each other due to parental controls. Starting today, this restriction has been lifted, allowing siblings to communicate freely via their Ace LTE devices. However, it’s important to note that while this encourages familial interaction, children are still unable to communicate with friends through the device. Instead, they can add each other in Bit Valley, where their virtual pets, called Eejies — Fitbit’s take on Tamagotchi — live.
Additionally, Family Quests aim to promote family bonding through fitness activities. The latest quest, named Turkey Berserky, is a Thanksgiving-themed challenge that tracks the family’s steps using the Ace LTE and Ace app. The collective goal is to reach 400,000 steps, and as families achieve goals, kids earn tickets to spend on digital items for their Eejies. There are also 50 new daily quests designed to teach kids about geography, nutrition, sleep hygiene, and other topics.
Along with quests, the smartwatch includes a Fitbit Arcade for kids to play while they walk or exercise. The newest title is Solar Sword, where players have to protect their village from invading monsters.
Fitbit also rolled out two new watch faces to help kids reach their movement goals. The watch face can be changed by long-pressing the home screen.
The Ace LTE is priced at $230, which aligns with the prices of Google’s older products, such as the Fitbit Sense 2 and Google Pixel Watch 2.
To access any of the features of the Ace LTE, users must sign up for Fitbit’s Ace Pass plan, which costs $10 per month or $119 per year. Additionally, siblings who subscribe to the plan from now until January 31 will receive a 50% discount."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/tesla-issues-sixth-cybertruck-recall-in-a-year/,Tesla issues sixth Cybertruck recall in a year | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-11-13,"Tesla’s Cybertruck is facing its sixth recall since its launch a year ago.
The recall affects 2,431 units, including certain 2024 Cybertrucks built between November 6, 2023 and July 30, 2024. A report from Tesla found that those trucks are or were equipped with a faulty drive inverter.
“If the inverter stops producing torque, the driver loses the ability to apply torque to the vehicle using the accelerator pedal resulting in a loss of propulsion, which may increase the risk of a collision,” reads Tesla’s report.
In October, Tesla recalled 27,185 Cybertrucks due to a delay in the rearview camera image that could impair driver visibility. Unlike that recall, which required an over-the-air update, Tesla will need to physically replace the recalled drive inverter, which the EV-maker said it would do free of charge.
Other Cybertruck recalls this year include one in April due to a sticky accelerator pedal, and another in June to fix potentially loose trim pieces and defective windshield wipers."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/deepl-launches-deepl-voice-real-time-text-based-translations-from-voices-and-videos/,"DeepL launches DeepL Voice, real-time, text-based translations from voices and videos | TechCrunch",Ingrid Lunden,2024-11-13,"DeepL has made a name for itself with online text translation it claims is more nuanced and precise than services from the likes of Google — a pitch that has catapulted the German startup to a valuation of $2 billion and more than 100,000 paying customers.
Now, as the hype for AI services continues to grow, DeepL is adding another mode to the platform: audio. Users will now be able to use DeepL Voice to listen to someone speaking in one language and automatically translate it to another, in real time.
English, German, Japanese, Korean, Swedish, Dutch, French, Turkish, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Italian are languages that DeepL can “hear” today. Translated captions are available for all of the 33 languages currently supported by DeepL Translator.
DeepL Voice is currently stopping short of delivering the result as an audio or video file itself: The service is aimed at real-time, live conversations and video conferencing, and comes through as text, not audio.
In the first of these, you can set up your translations to appear as “mirrors” on a smartphone — the idea being that you put the phone between you on a meeting table for each side to see the words translated — or as a transcription that you share side by side with someone. The videoconferencing service sees the translations appearing as subtitles.
That could be something that changes over time, Jarek Kutylowski, the company’s founder and CEO (pictured above), hinted in an interview. This is DeepL’s first product for voice, but it’s unlikely to be its last. “[Voice] is where translation is going to play out in the next year,” he added.
There is other evidence to support that statement. Google — one of DeepL’s biggest competitors — also started to incorporate real-time translated captions into its Meet video conferencing service. And, there are a multitude of AI startups building voice translation services, such as AI voice specialist ElevenLabs (ElevenLabs Dubbing), and Panjaya, which creates translations using “deepfake” voices and video that matches the audio.
The latter uses ElevenLabs’ API, and according to Kutylowski, ElevenLabs itself is using tech from DeepL to power its translation service.
Audio output is not the only feature yet to launch.
There is also no API for the voice product right now. DeepL’s main business is focused on B2B and Kutylowski said the company is working with partners and customers directly.
Nor is there a wide choice of integrations: The only video calling service that supports DeepL’s subtitles currently is Teams, which “covers most of our customers,”  Kutylowski said. There’s no word on when or if Zoom or Google Meet will be incorporating DeepL Voice down the line.
The product will feel like a long time coming for DeepL users, not just because we’ve been awash in a plethora of other AI voice services aimed at translation. Kutylowski said that this has been the No. 1 request from customers since 2017, the year DeepL launched.
Part of the reason for the wait is that DeepL has been taking a pretty deliberate approach to building its product. Unlike many others in the world of AI applications that lean on and tweak other companies’ large language models (LLMs), DeepL’s aim is to build its service from the ground up. In July, the company released a new LLM optimized for translations that it says outperforms GPT-4, and those from Google and Microsoft, not least because its primary purpose is for translation. The company has also continued to enhance the quality of its written output and glossary.
Similarly, one of DeepL Voice’s unique selling points is that it will work in real time, which is important since a lot of “AI translation” services on the market actually work on a delay, making them harder or impossible to use in live situations, which is the use case that DeepL is addressing.
Kutylowski hinted that this was another reason behind why the new voice-processing product is focusing on text-based translations: They can be computed and produced very fast, while processing and AI architecture still has a way to go before being able to produce audio and video as quickly.
Video conferencing and meetings are likely use cases for DeepL Voice, but Kutylowski noted that another major one the company envisions is in the service industry, where front-line workers at, say, restaurants could use the service to help communicate with customers more easily.
This could be useful, but it also highlights one of the rougher points of the service. In a world where we are all suddenly a lot more aware of data protection and concerns about how new services and platforms are co-opting private or proprietary information, it remains to be seen how keen people will be to have their voices being picked up and used in this way.
Kutylowski insisted that although voices will be traveling to its servers to be translated (the processing does not happen on-device), nothing is retained by its systems, nor used for training its LLMs. Ultimately, DeepL will work with its customers to make sure that they do not violate GDPR or any other data protection regulations."

The fintech said on Wednesday that it has confidentially filed a draft registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The announcement of the listing, a long time in the making, arrives amid a dearth of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the technology sector. Klarna’s European status only adds more fervor to today’s news.
Founded in 2005, Klarna is one of several players in the BNPL space that enable customers to purchase goods with the promise of interest-free credit. After launching in the U.S. in 2015, Klarna hit a hefty valuation of more than $45 billion by 2021, a figure that swiftly plummeted by 85% to $6.5 billion due to market “corrections.”
However, Klarna’s valuation recently rose to $14.6 billion, according to reports, after one investor increased its stake.
We still don’t know how many shares will be offered, or the price range of the IPO, but today’s announcement paves the way for Klarna to go public likely some time in the first half of 2025."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/after-spending-three-years-working-on-sms-verification-at-zenly-prelude-wants-to-fix-sms-onboarding/,"After spending three years working on SMS verification at Zenly, Prelude founders want to fix SMS onboarding | TechCrunch",Romain Dillet,2024-11-13,"Prelude is a relatively new French startup that focuses on SMS verification; it’s announcing new funding from Singular and Seedcamp on Wednesday. The two founders met when they were working for Zenly, a popular location-sharing app with tens of millions of users that was acquired by Snap (and later shut down). While you might not think much about those verification codes, the Zenly team thought about this topic quite intensely. It turns out that it’s extremely tedious to implement SMS verification codes that work reliably.
“Initially, when I started looking at this problem at Zenly, we only had one provider. And honestly, when I joined the company, I thought it would be a problem that would be fixed in a couple of months and we could move on. As it turns out, I spent most of the three years I stayed at Zenly on this issue, and we built a team around it,” Prelude co-founder and CEO Matias Berny (pictured above on the left) told TechCrunch.
You probably don’t pay for text messages on your personal phone, but telecom providers still charge companies for those text messages. And if you have a massive user base, SMS verification can become an extremely expensive cost center.
In late 2023, the Signal Foundation shared its operating budget for its popular messaging app and service; SMS verification codes alone cost $6 million per year. As a comparison, storage, servers, and bandwidth account for $7 million per year altogether.
You might think that it’s expensive, but — at least — that this is a problem that has already been fixed. A few years ago, Twilio made it easy to send SMS using programmatic calls, after all. Other companies followed suit with SMS verification APIs.
But when you request a verification code, the request is passed around several phone carriers and various intermediaries across multiple countries. This patchwork means that it can take a bit of time before you receive the verification code — when it doesn’t fail completely.
“What we’ve been building at Zenly — and now at Prelude on a larger scale — is really the Skyscanner of phone number verification. We’ll find the best route at any given moment to verify the user’s phone number,” Berny said.
This feature alone can help companies improve their conversion rates. But it can also help companies save money as new customers don’t have to hit the “resend code” button if they didn’t get anything.
“Beyond the smart routing aspect of the product, there are many other problems to solve,” Berny said. Fraud is one of them. “There are fake users who ask for fake codes to validate fake numbers with the aim of receiving a portion of the cost of the SMS,” he added.
According to the Prelude team, these fraudulent intermediaries that generate fake users to create artificial SMS traffic can represent as much as 30% of SMS verification codes. That’s why the startup tries to identify fake, virtual numbers with a variety of signals to stop text messages in the first place.
Prelude also doesn’t charge its customers depending on the number of text messages issued by the startup. It aligns the incentives with its own customers as it charges per verification. That’s also why Prelude supports other messaging services, such as WhatsApp and Viber; it’s more about verification than SMS.
Many popular consumer apps, such as BeReal and Locket, are already using Prelude. Companies in the fintech or crypto industries, such as Alma, Sunday, and Bitstack are also relying on Prelude to verify phone numbers.
The startup has raised $8 million so far with Singular and Seedcamp leading the company’s seed round and various angels also participating. Overall, the company has verified the phone numbers for 100 million different user accounts so far, it said."

The divestiture comes as food and grocery delivery becomes an increasingly unprofitable endeavor for businesses that bet the farm on the model during the COVID-19 pandemic and later, when people sheltering in place and social distancing opted to order in food and grocery items they would previously buy in person.
The food delivery and quick-commerce sectors saw a massive influx of venture capital and other investment in the following years, with startups like Getir and Flink raising millions and investing aggressively in marketing and acquisitions.
But once the world returned to a semblance of normalcy and post-pandemic tailwinds trailed off, the instant delivery model proved unsustainable. Flink is now said to be valued at just under $1 billion, down from a peak of nearly $3 billion, while Getir has retreated, shutting down its operations in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe to focus on its home market of Turkey.
Just Eat Takeaway itself has been trying to sell Grubhub for years. The company first announced it was looking to sell Grubhub in April 2022 to focus on profitability, less than a year after closing the deal to acquire it, but last year, its CEO said a sale was proving to be “very difficult.”
“The sale of Grubhub to Wonder will increase the cash generation capabilities of Just Eat Takeaway.com and will accelerate our growth,” Jitse Groen, Just Eat Takeaway’s CEO, said in a statement. The company said the sale would allow it to invest in countries where it has a competitive advantage and generate free cash flow.
Wonder’s CEO Marc Lore said that the company aims to create a super app for food delivery through this acquisition.
“We’re excited to soon offer a curated selection of Grubhub’s restaurant partners directly in the Wonder app, alongside our owned and operated restaurants and meal kits. Bringing Wonder and Grubhub together is the next step in our vision to create the super app for meal time, re-envisioning the future of food delivery,” he said in a statement.
Wonder has raised more than $1.7 billion in funding, according to Crunchbase, with backers like Accel, Bain Capital Ventures, Google Ventures, Nestlé, and Forerunner Ventures."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/youtube-is-now-letting-creators-remix-songs-through-ai-prompting/,YouTube is testing a feature that lets select creators remix songs using AI | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-13,"YouTube last year started letting select creators in the U.S. create AI-generated songs with prompts using the vocals of artists like Charlie Puth, Charli XCX, Demi Lovato, John Legend, Sia, T-Pain, and Troye Sivan. Now, the company is adding a feature to its Dream Track toolset that lets creators remix tracks by describing how they want to change the style of the song.
The video streaming platform said it is making select songs available to creators for the remix experiment. Creators in the test group can select the “Restyle a track” option for a song, and describe how they want to remix it. This will generate a 30-second snippet that creators can use in Shorts.
“If you want to give a song a different genre or mood, you simply enter your vision into the ‘Restyle a track’ prompt and you’ll soon have a customized soundtrack that reimagines the music while maintaining the essence of the original song’s vocals and lyrics,” the update reads.
Google noted these remixed snippets will be credited to the original song through the Short video itself and the Shorts audio pivot page. Remixes will also have an appropriate label to indicate that the track was modified with AI.
YouTube’s Dream Track toolset, launched last November, is powered by the Lyria music generation model developed by DeepMind. At the time, the platform also released a tool that lets users create a track by just humming a tune.
To save itself from the music industry’s ire, YouTube last August said — before releasing any of these tools — that it plans to compensate artists and rights holders for using their work in its AI features. To that end, the company announced a partnership with Universal Music Group (UMG) to develop a structure to pay rights holders.
YouTube is not the only company working on providing ways for users to remix tracks. Former JioSaavn exec Gaurav Sharma is building an app called Hook that lets users remix songs that could be used to create short videos."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/swiggy-debut-fuels-indias-food-quick-commerce-wars/,India's Swiggy delivers 2024's largest tech IPO globally | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-11-13,"Shares of Swiggy ended debut day up 10.67% at ₹455.95 ($5.4) on Wednesday as the food-delivery and quick-commerce startup concluded India’s second-largest IPO this year. The closely watched listing makes the company a direct comparable for what analysts have long considered the benchmark Indian internet stock: Zomato.
The listing of the 10-year-old Bengaluru-headquartered firm marks a milestone for India’s startup ecosystem, where several firms are eyeing similarly large public offerings in the next 24 months. It’s also a major liquidity event for Swiggy’s backers, which include Prosus (its paper returns have already reached $2 billion), SoftBank, and Accel. Some 5,000 employees stand to collectively reap about $1 billion.
In a note to clients, reviewed by TechCrunch, JPMorgan said Swiggy’s IPO is the largest tech IPO globally this year.
In the run-up to the $1.4 billion IPO, Swiggy set its valuation at $11.3 billion, a notably conservative figure given that Zomato recently hit a market-cap high of $29 billion.
In an interview, Swiggy’s co-founder and chief executive Sriharsha Majety said the firm wanted to make the offering exciting for new investors. The company’s market cap jumped to $12.3 billion on Wednesday.
Swiggy’s stellar debut on Wednesday defied the weak market in India this week, with benchmark Sensex and Nifty extending their decline for the fourth consecutive day.
“One of the things I am most excited about is that Swiggy itself is happening at an incredible time,” said Majety in a speech. “When we look at the next one to two decades, I think it’s India’s next two decades. There’s so much economic growth in front of us. The Indian pride is at an all-time high.”
Swiggy enters the public markets at a pivotal moment for India’s e-commerce landscape. While the company has established itself as India’s second-largest food delivery platform with 14 million monthly active users, it trails market leader Zomato across key metrics — its annualized gross order value of $3.3 billion in food delivery lags about 25% behind Zomato’s, according to Macquarie.
The gap is bigger when it comes to the fast-growing and increasingly important quick-commerce sector — services promising deliveries of grocery, wellness, beauty products, and more within 15 minutes. Swiggy’s Instamart service has 5.2 million monthly users compared to Zomato-owned Blinkit’s 7.6 million monthly users.
There’s another more important metric that new public market investors will care about: While Blinkit has reached adjusted EBITDA break-even, Instamart is still losing money even at the contribution margin level.
“We believe each of Swiggy’s business segments deserve to get lower target valuation multiple compared to that of Zomato’s due to poor execution in the past, which has led to widening of the market share gap,” JM Financial analysts said on Wednesday.
Still, the opportunity ahead is substantial. Morgan Stanley estimates gross order values in India’s quick-commerce market could reach $42 billion by 2030, representing over 18% of the country’s total e-commerce market. The sector has already grown at a blistering 77% annually since it took off during the pandemic.
JPMorgan reports that quick-commerce platforms have already captured 56% of the online grocery delivery market from traditional e-commerce players.
However, competitive pressures are intensifying. Traditional retail giants like Flipkart and Reliance’s JioMart are launching their own rapid delivery services. Also, questions persist about the viability of the quick-commerce model outside major urban cities, given its reliance on dense networks of small warehouses."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/perplexity-brings-ads-to-its-platform/,Perplexity brings ads to its platform | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-13,"AI-powered search engine Perplexity says it’ll begin experimenting with ads on its platform starting this week.
The site will be showing ads in the U.S. to start, and they’ll be formatted as “sponsored follow-up questions,” (e.g. “How can I use LinkedIn to enhance my job search?”). These ads will be positioned to the side of answers and labeled as “sponsored.”
Brands and agency partners participating in Perplexity’s ad program include Indeed, Whole Foods, Universal McCann, and PMG.
“Ad programs like this help us generate revenue to share with our publisher partners,” Perplexity wrote in a post on its blog. “Experience has taught us that subscriptions alone do not generate enough revenue to create a sustainable revenue-sharing program. [A]dvertising is the best way to ensure a steady and scalable revenue stream.”
Perplexity asserted that answers to these “sponsored questions” will still be generated by its AI — not written or edited by the brands sponsoring the questions. Advertisers also won’t get access to users’ personal info, the company said.
“We intentionally chose these formats because it integrates advertising in a way that still protects the utility, accuracy and objectivity of answers,” the blog post read. “These ads will not change our commitment to maintaining a trusted service that provides you with direct, unbiased answers to your questions.”
Perplexity’s embrace of ads stands in contrast to OpenAI’s decision not to launch its AI-powered search tool, ChatGPT Search, with ads. Rival Google has similarly piloted ads in its AI search experience, AI Overviews — recently showing ads for certain queries on mobile in the U.S.
Perplexity is reportedly marketing its ad products as a premium alternative to Google’s, emphasizing its platform’s ability to reach educated, high-income consumers, per CNBC. But some analysts have expressed concerns about the scale, reach, and targeting capabilities of ads on Perplexity.
Illustrating the challenge of incorporating ads into AI-generated content, Microsoft only briefly explored showing ads in the responses given by its chatbot on Bing. It quietly withdrew the “sponsored results” after a few weeks.
Perplexity has been accused of plagiarism, though, which could be another potential deterrent for advertisers. News Corp’s Dow Jones and the NY Post have sued the AI company over what they describe as a “content kleptocracy.” Many other news sites have shown evidence that Perplexity closely replicates their content, and last month, The New York Times sent the startup a cease and desist.
Perplexity, which recently said it’s serving 100 million search queries a week, claims it has changed how its platform cites sources, and continues to expand its revenue-sharing program for publishers. But the company has also argued that publishers wished its technology “didn’t exist” and they would prefer that “publicly reported facts are owned by corporations.”
There’s pressure on Perplexity to ramp up monetization. The company is reportedly in the final stages of raising $500 million in funding at a $9 billion valuation, but it has only one revenue stream: its premium subscription service, Perplexity Pro, which provides additional features for $20 per month or $200 per year."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/donald-trump-announces-elon-musk-will-co-lead-department-of-government-efficiency/,Donald Trump announces Elon Musk will co-lead Department of Government Efficiency | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-11-13,"President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that Elon Musk will co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, the acronym of which spells out DOGE, Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency. The CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, and owner of X, Neuralink, and The Boring Company will lead the department alongside biotech entrepreneur and former presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy to pave the way for Trump’s administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.”
Notably, DOGE will “provide advice and guidance from outside of Government,” which suggests it will not be an official government agency that requires legislative approvals and funding. Rather, DOGE will partner with the White House and Office of Management & Budget, according to the press release.
The Trump campaign noted that DOGE’s work would conclude no later than July 4, 2026.
Musk referenced creating a Department of Government Efficiency for the last several months while campaigning for Trump across the country. However, it wasn’t clear what shape DOGE would truly take or whether Trump would really take Musk up on this offer.
At an October rally in New York, Musk promised to identify “at least $2 trillion in cuts” within federal agencies if Trump wins. Whether Musk and Ramaswamy follow through on that promise is yet to be seen. Musk never clarified which agencies or polices would be receiving those cuts.
Trump and Musk have become quite close in recent months, and their relationship has only accelerated since the two hosted an X Spaces chat together in August. During Trump’s 2024 presidential run, Musk donated over $100 million to a pro-Trump super PAC, dubbed the America PAC, while also holding rallies for Trump in key swing states. Trump promised Musk the position as head of DOGE during a September appearance at the Economic Club of New York.
Correction: This article previously misstated Elon Musk’s title at Neuralink."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/nasa-awards-sustainable-aircraft-concepts-11-5m/,NASA awards 'sustainable' aircraft concepts $11.5M | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-11-13,"The future of aircraft may look very similar to today’s superficially — but under the hood (or sitting next to the tail fins) they will likely be quite different. That’s the future NASA is hoping to nurture with five research awards worth $11.5 million.
The Advanced Aircraft Concepts for Environmental Sustainability 2050 (AACES) program is an early-stage, long-shot initiative to identify “transformative solutions” that could inch the carbon-spewing air travel industry toward sustainability.
These awards are nowhere near enough to make a working aircraft, of course, and these concepts are just that, concepts — but a couple million bucks can easily be the difference between a powerful new technology sitting on a shelf in a lab or getting some real-world testing.
Two of the awards are more focused than others. Electra, for instance, already has a flying prototype for its electric aircraft, and the award money will go toward advancing its existing tech. JetZero is combining a cryogenic liquid hydrogen fuel source with the unusual blended wing fuselage you see pictured up top.
The other three awards are more general. Georgia Tech will look into new fuels, propulsion systems, and configurations that seem promising for its ATH2ENA program. Pratt and Whitney will be looking into “a broad suite” of propulsion tech in pursuit of lowering fuel consumption and emissions (a harm reduction method, it seems).
Aurora Flight Sciences seems to have the broadest mandate of all — the Boeing-owned company will “perform a comprehensive, ‘open-aperture’ exploration of technologies and aircraft concepts.” One hopes they were a bit more specific in their application!
Interestingly, none of the electric propulsion and flight startups we’ve seen collecting large sums of investor money are present here. Perhaps the juice was not worth the squeeze when they have VC money on tap — or else their visions for the future of aviation are too different. (They do mostly make personal helicopters, after all.)
The AACES project is part of the Advanced Air Transport Technology project, itself part of the Advanced Air Vehicles Program. If there are any more layers on top of that, they didn’t list them."

As early as March 2025, the iPhone maker could release a tablet that mounts to your wall, controls smart home appliances, does video calls, and of course features Apple Intelligence.
The device reportedly has a 6-inch touchscreen, but it’s expected that, like a HomePod, it will use voice to control it, either through Siri, Apple Intelligence, or an upcoming system called “App Intents” that lets AI control applications. It supposedly runs on a new OS, with sensors to detect how close a person is, but will have traditional Apple apps like Safari, Apple Music, Notes, and Calendar.
Apple’s “command center for the home” seems intended as a rival to Amazon’s Echo Hub and Google’s Nest Hub, so expect it to be priced similarly (i.e., $100 to $250). However, Apple is also working on an iPad on a robotic arm that follows you around the room, which could cost closer to $1,000."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/techcrunch-space-nothing-to-see-here/,TechCrunch Space: Nothing to see here! | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-11-12,"Hello, and welcome back to TechCrunch Space. There was absolutely no news last week because nothing happened.
Just kidding.
Defying all early polling, Donald Trump swept the election and will soon be sworn in for his second term in office. From a space policy perspective, things are already starting to look interesting. That’s mostly due to the prominent role SpaceX CEO Elon Musk played in the run-up to the election, and the role he could play in the next administration.
There’s already been some great reporting from The New York Times on their relationship; I’ll point to this story, which describes how Musk joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and this one, in which sources say that Musk wanted Trump to hire SpaceX employees to top government positions, including at the Department of Defense.
If Musk manages to secure even a fraction of the influence that he has talked about in recent weeks — like heading a Department of Government Efficiency — we could see the head of the biggest space company, the biggest electric vehicle manufacturer, and one of the largest social media platforms gain as-of-yet-unheard of influence.

Senior reporter Rebecca Bellan and I dove into what Trump’s presidency might mean for Elon Musk. Bellan covers all things transportation, so she took a close look at the prospects for Tesla, and I threw in my two cents about the implications for space policy. We tried very, very hard not to speculate too much — at this point, it’s too easy to drift into fantasy, and there are too many unknowns — but there’s still plenty of info to go on.
Speaking of SpaceX, the company is gearing up to launch its sixth integrated flight test of Starship on November 18. Many of the test objectives are the same as the fifth test, which saw the Super Heavy booster return to the launch site for the first time ever, but SpaceX did say it will be testing some hardware and software upgrades.
With Musk having the ear of the next sitting president, Mars is on everyone’s minds in a new way. It’s entirely possible that SpaceX could indeed launch an uncrewed Starship to Mars when the next Earth-Mars transit window opens in 2026. But this week, we’re looking back at a very small spacecraft that made history as the first human-made object to orbit the red planet: Mariner 9, which entered Mars’ orbit on November 13, 1971.
When the probe arrived, a massive dust storm was obscuring most of the planet’s features. That calmed down, and Mariner 9 was able to take a number of incredible images over its 10 months orbiting the planet. Much of what it saw completely shocked scientists."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/23andme-cuts-40-of-staff-in-restructuring/,23andMe cuts 40% of staff in restructuring | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-11-12,"23andMe announced on Monday it would cut 40% of its workforce, representing more than 200 employees, as part of a restructuring at the company. The genetic testing company is also discontinuing its therapeutics business and winding down its clinical trials; it expects these changes to save $35 million annually.
“We are taking these difficult but necessary actions as we restructure 23andMe and focus on the long-term success of our core consumer business and research partnerships,” said CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki in a press release. “I want to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our mission.”
On Tuesday, 23andMe reported $44 million in revenue during the second quarter, a decline from $50 million during the same period last year.
The mass workforce reductions mark the latest disruption in a tumultuous year for 23andMe. In September, 23andMe’s entire board of directors — including Silicon Valley icons such as YouTube CEO Neal Mohan — resigned following Wojcicki’s attempt to take the company private in August.
To start 2024 off, 23andMe was trying to save its reputation after a massive cyberattack, in which hackers stole ancestry data on 6.9 million users.
On a personal level, this has also been a difficult year for Anne Wojcicki, whose sister died in August. Susan Wojcicki was the longtime CEO of YouTube, and many people in Silicon Valley saw her as a visionary.
On Tuesday, 23andMe’s stock was slightly up, ending the day at $4.71 a share, but still significantly down from its 2021 high, which at one point reached over $300."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/generative-disinfo-is-real-youre-just-not-the-target-warns-deepfake-tracking-nonprofit/,"Generative disinfo is real — you're just not the target, warns deepfake tracking nonprofit | TechCrunch",Devin Coldewey,2024-11-12,"Many feared that the 2024 election would be affected, and perhaps decided, by AI-generated disinformation. While there was some to be found, it was far less than anticipated. But don’t let that fool you: The disinfo threat is real — you’re just not the target.
Or at least so says Oren Etzioni, an AI researcher of long standing whose nonprofit TrueMedia has its finger on the generated disinformation pulse.
“There is, for lack of a better word, a diversity of deepfakes,” he told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “Each one serves its own purpose, and some we’re more aware of than others. Let me put it this way: For every thing that you actually hear about, there are a hundred that are not targeted at you. Maybe a thousand. It’s really only the very tip of the iceberg that makes it to the mainstream press.”
The fact is that most people, and Americans more than most, tend to think that what they experience is the same as what others experience. That isn’t true for a lot of reasons. But in the case of disinformation campaigns, America is actually a hard target, given a relatively well-informed populace, readily available factual information, and a press that is trusted at least most of the time (despite all the noise to the contrary).
We tend to think of deepfakes as something like a video of Taylor Swift doing or saying something she wouldn’t. But the really dangerous deepfakes are not the ones of celebrities or politicians, but of situations and people that can’t be so easily identified and counteracted.
“The biggest thing people don’t get is the variety. I saw one today of Iranian planes over Israel,” he noted — something that didn’t happen but can’t easily be disproven by someone not on the ground there. “You don’t see it because you’re not on the Telegram channel, or in certain WhatsApp groups — but millions are.”
TrueMedia offers a free service (via web and API) for identifying images, video, audio, and other items as fake or real. It’s no simple task and can’t be completely automated, but they are slowly building a foundation of ground truth material that feeds back into the process.
“Our primary mission is detection. The academic benchmarks [for evaluating fake media] have long since been plowed over,” Etzioni explained. “We train on things uploaded by people all over the world; we see what the different vendors say about it, what our models say about it, and we generate a conclusion. As a follow-up, we have a forensic team doing a deeper investigation that’s more extensive and slower, not on all the items but a significant fraction, so we have a ground truth. We don’t assign a truth value unless we’re quite sure; we can still be wrong, but we’re substantially better than any other single solution.”
The primary mission is in service of quantifying the problem in three key ways Etzioni outlined:
All of these are works in progress, some just beginning, he emphasized. But you have to start somewhere.
“Let me make a bold prediction: Over the next 4 years, we’re going to become much more adept at measuring this,” he said. “Because we have to. Right now we’re just trying to cope.”
As for some of the industry and technological attempts to make generated media more obvious, such as watermarking images and text, they’re harmless and maybe beneficial, but don’t even begin to solve the problem, he said.
“The way I’d put it is, don’t bring a watermark to a gunfight.” These voluntary standards are helpful in collaborative ecosystems where everyone has a reason to use them, but they offer little protection against malicious actors who want to avoid detection.
It all sounds rather dire, and it is, but  the most consequential election in recent history just took place without much in the way of AI shenanigans. That is not because generative disinfo isn’t commonplace, but because its purveyors didn’t feel it necessary to take part. Whether that scares you more or less than the alternative is quite up to you."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/the-rivian-volkswagen-joint-venture-deal-is-now-up-to-5-8b/,The Rivian-Volkswagen joint venture deal is now up to $5.8B | TechCrunch,"Sean O'Kane, Kirsten Korosec",2024-11-12,"Rivian and Volkswagen Group have finalized a multibillion-dollar joint venture to develop software, paving the way to let the German auto giant leverage the EV startup’s more technical chops in the coming years. Volkswagen will invest up to $5.8 billion by 2027, about 16% more than when the deal was first announced in June.
Volkswagen Group has already made an initial investment of $1 billion in the form of a convertible note.
The new joint venture — Rivian and Volkswagen Group Technologies — will officially kick off November 13 as an independent company. And, if successful, it could be a boon for both companies. Rivian gets a needed injection of capital and the opportunity to diversify its business, while VW Group gains a next-generation electrical architecture and software for EVs that will help it better compete. Both companies argue the joint venture will reduce development costs and help scale new technologies more quickly.
The companies designed the joint venture as a 50-50 partnership with co-CEOs, who will report into both Rivian and Volkswagen Group. Rivian’s head of software, Wassym Bensaid, and Volkswagen Group’s chief technical engineer, Carsten Helbing, will lead the joint venture. Developers and software engineers from both companies will join the joint venture, according to Rivian and VW. The team will be based initially in Palo Alto, California. Three other sites are in development in North America and Europe, the companies said Tuesday.VW, and more specifically its software arm Cariad, has struggled in recent years to deliver what some in the industry have dubbed a “software-defined vehicle.” This jargon industry term, sometimes abbreviated SDV, means any car, truck, or SUV with capabilities that can be upgraded over time (or even new functions added) via software. Automakers view these software-defined vehicles as a new way to make money via in-car entertainment and services; it’s also seen essential for automakers aiming to compete with Tesla. Earlier this year, Rivian started producing the next-generation of its R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, an upgrade that reworked the guts of its vehicles, including a new electrical architecture and compute platform. That new electrical architecture is seen internally as a key innovation at Rivian and one that allows the company to wirelessly update software.
With the Rivian-VW joint venture steering software development for the German automaker’s next-generation of EVs, Cariad’s future is uncertain. VW Group CEO Oliver Blume said Tuesday that Cariad will continue to play a “central role” in its global software strategy at Volkswagen Group, adding the software arm will be responsible for the existing software platform in today’s vehicles over the next decade. Cariad is also in charge of software governance, which covers autonomous driving, data management, and cloud services.
Prior to the initial June announcement, Cariad had hired at least 23 of Rivian’s top employees over the past several months to bolster its Silicon Valley outpost called the SDV Hub. The SDV hub is ground zero for Cariad’s next-generation software architecture known as “software 2.0.”Now Rivian will contribute even more talent toward the joint venture. “Rivian will be contributing a significant portion of the team,” Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said during a press conference Tuesday afternoon.
The JV team plans to use the existing Rivian electrical architecture and software technology stack to enable the launch of Rivian’s R2 midsize SUV in the first half of 2026 and support the expected launch of the first models from the Volkswagen Group as early as 2027, the companies said.
Last month at Disrupt 2024, Bensaid described the joint venture as an opportunity for Rivian to bring its software to multiple brands, including the VW spinoff Scout. He said each brand that uses the joint venture’s software will “continue to have their own identity,” as well as “their own features.”
“We’re enabling competition,” Bensaid said at the time. Scout has since confirmed that its vehicles will be among the first to use the new zonal architecture built by the Volkswagen Group-Rivian joint venture."

The collaboration could boost fashion creators’ ability to earn affiliate commissions via LTK, while also making it easier for consumers to locate the clothes and accessories creators are talking about.
If you follow fashion creators on TikTok, then you know about LTK (formerly LiketoKnow.it and RewardStyle). The app looks something like Pinterest or Instagram, but creators can post what they’re wearing and link directly to the websites in question so viewers can buy the items, too.
TikTok and LTK have both changed online shopping by giving consumers more information about what they’re ordering — if you’re trying to figure out what size to order, for example, you can search specific items and their sizes on each respective app. If the brand is popular enough, odds are that you’ll be able to find a creator modeling the clothes who has a similar body shape to you, making it easier to decide if you want to order the product.
Linking the TikTok and LTK apps together only makes that experience more seamless and boosts TikTok’s reputation as a shopping app, not just an entertainment destination.
When a creator uses the new LTK integration, a link to the item on LTK will appear in the comments section. For now, this only shows up within the TikTok app.
LTK confirmed the feature exists but was unable to provide further comment or details at this time. However, creators on Threads have posted about being invited to the program, in addition to the videos creators posted on TikTok with links to LTK."

During his campaign, Trump promised voters that he would save the popular social media app if elected.
Former Trump adviser and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told the Post that the president-elect “appreciates the breadth and reach of TikTok” and that “there are many ways to hold China to account outside alienating 180 million U.S. users each month.”
The Post also cited three anonymous Trump aides who believe that the president-elect will intervene on TikTok’s behalf to halt the ban.
Although Trump was the one to initiate calls to ban the app during his first term, he took a different approach during his 2024 campaign and is now concerned that a TikTok ban would benefit Meta.

Anysphere CEO Michael Truell announced the deal in a post on Cursor’s blog. Supermaven, he said, will enable Anysphere to launch a new version of its Tab AI model that’s “fast, context-aware, and highly intelligent,” especially at sequences of long code.
Supermaven’s plugins will remain maintained, Truell said, though Cursor will become the team’s core focus.
“This is roughly the same as Supermaven’s previous plan: the team had shifted focus to an editor, because extension APIs were blocking the next useful things that they wanted to build,” Truell wrote in his post. “Why join forces? We have a lot to do, and it seems like we can build a more useful product, faster, together.”
Supermaven was founded by Jacob Jackson, who previously co-founded Tabnine, the AI coding assistant. After selling Tabnine to Codata in 2019, Jackson joined OpenAI as an intern, where he worked until 2022.
Supermaven is an AI coding platform along the lines of Tabnine, but with a few quality-of-life and technical upgrades. Its in-house generative AI model, Babble, can understand a lot of code at once, and thanks to a custom architecture, it is extremely low-latency.
As of September, more than 35,000 developers had signed up for Supermaven. And Supermaven managed to raise $12 million from investors, including Bessemer Venture Partners, OpenAI co-founder John Schulman, and Perplexity co-founder Denis Yarats.
Supermaven, which launched in February, wasn’t planning for an exit. But the timing felt right, Jackson says.
“As Supermaven matured, we realized that the next step for the product was not just smarter models, but models with new capabilities co-designed with the user interface to access those capabilities,” he wrote in a post on Supermaven’s blog. “Initially, we worked to build our own editor, but we were also in touch with the Cursor team, and as I came to know them better, I felt we could build a much more useful product together than Supermaven could build alone.”
As part of Cursor, the Supermaven team will have the ability to design the editor UI together with the models, Jackson added.
The acquisition comes as Anysphere receives unsolicited offers, valuing the company at as much as $2.5 billion, from Benchmark, Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and others, TechCrunch exclusively reported. Interest in the company, which was co-founded in 2022 by Truell, Sualeh Asif, Arvid Lunnemark, and Aman Sanger, has exploded in recent weeks.
The market for AI coding tools is a large and growing one, with Polaris Research projecting that it’ll be worth $27.17 billion by 2032. The vast majority of respondents in GitHub’s latest dev poll say that they’ve adopted AI tools in some form, and over 1.8 million people — and ~50,000 businesses — are paying for GitHub Copilot.
There’s no shortage of AI-powered coding assistance startups — see Augment, Codeium, Magic, and Poolside. But Cursor has become one of the more popular options. Sources tell TechCrunch that its revenue has grown to $4 million a month."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/bluesky-is-seeing-an-exodus-of-unhappy-x-users-following-the-election/,Bluesky is benefitting from an exodus of unhappy X users following the election | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-11-12,"X, formerly Twitter, is no longer the “digital town square” it once promised to be. Following the results of the U.S. presidential election, floods of users unhappy with the app’s latest direction are moving over to a competing app, Bluesky.
Bluesky’s decentralized social media platform has steadily grown from 9+ million users as of September to  14.6+ million as of Tuesday, with the latest surge taking place over the weekend as U.S. users fled X.
The exodus briefly made Bluesky the No. 2 iPhone app in the U.S. App Store on Monday, up from No. 27 the day after the elections. On Tuesday, it’s dropped slightly to No. 3, behind Meta’s Threads and ChatGPT.
The pace of new user sign-ups is also worth noting. On Monday, multiple outlets reported Bluesky had gained more than 700,000 users over the past week, bringing its total to 14.5 million. One day later, it’s over 14.6 million, indicating that roughly 100,000 users are joining daily.
According to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures, Bluesky’s U.S. downloads have grown by 933% year-to-date, while X’s have grown by 48%. Appfigures also noted that Bluesky’s downloads on November 10 had increased by 624% compared to November 1. Bluesky on Tuesday said that 1 million people have joined over the past week.
“The majority of Bluesky’s new users are coming from the United States, Canada, and the U.K.,” Bluesky team member Emily Lu told TechCrunch. “We’re seeing increased activity levels across all different forms of engagement: likes, follows, new accounts, etc. We’re excited to welcome these communities to Bluesky, which range from Swifties to sports fans to journalists. Users have also been sharing feedback that they’re receiving more engagement — and higher-quality engagement — on Bluesky than on other platforms despite initially having more followers elsewhere,” she added.
According to Bluesky CEO Jay Graber, engagement on Bluesky often tends to be higher than on X — and that’s not a recent trend. Though X still has the numbers because many users abandon but don’t delete their X accounts, Bluesky tends to have a higher percentage of “posters” — meaning those who actively engage instead of lurk— Graber says.
“We … have a higher percentage of posters than most social sites, which follow a 90-9-1 pattern of lurkers-commenters-posters. We haven’t dipped below ~30% posters,” she remarked in a Bluesky post on Tuesday. For newcomers, she recommends posting into relevant feeds, commenting on others’ posts, seeking out your mutuals (those you follow who follow you in return), and using hashtags to increase engagement with your own content.
The shifts in user adoption follow the changes Elon Musk has made since buying the company formerly known as Twitter in the fall of 2022. The Telsa and SpaceX exec originally promised to turn his $44 billion acquisition into a free-speech platform where everyone’s voice would be heard. But Musk instead leveraged the app to promote right-wing views, campaign for Trump, and suspend accounts at a higher rate than before, according to X’s own transparency report data.
Although Musk may have once thought Twitter favored the left, he hasn’t retooled the app as a neutral platform. In fact, studies found that Musk’s own right-leaning political posts appeared in X users’ feeds even if users didn’t follow him or engage with his content.
With his 204 million followers, the platform gives Musk incredible reach to promote his own political views and rally for Trump.
Of course, some worry that Bluesky itself will become a partisan platform if flooded by liberals leaving X. But the nature of how its platform has been built doesn’t lend itself to becoming driven by its owner’s political views. In addition to standard blocking and reporting features, Bluesky allows users to create their own algorithms and custom feeds and subscribe to their own moderation services to personalize the app to their liking. If Bluesky’s app and moderation decisions don’t meet your needs, people will be able to run the social software on their own servers, somewhat similar to the open source X competitor Mastodon (though Bluesky uses a different protocol, the AT protocol, instead of Mastodon and Threads’ ActivityPub.)
Interest in Bluesky has been growing for some time, and not only because of its infrastructure and design. Bluesky benefited from other surges before, including when X was banned in Brazil and when Threads was dealing with moderation issues, for instance. But this latest bump is an indication that more left-leaning users are deciding to be done with X. And without the combative back-and-forth political chatter Twitter became known for, its future as the “global town square” becomes ever more uncertain.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/chrome-on-ios-now-lets-you-search-using-images-and-text-at-the-same-time/,Chrome on iOS now lets you search using images and text at the same time | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-11-12,"Google is rolling out a few new features for Chrome on iOS, the company announced on Tuesday. Most notably, Google Chrome on iOS now lets you search using images and text at the same time.
While you could already do this using the Google Lens iOS app, you can now do so directly within the Chrome app. Plus, although you could already use images to search on Chrome on iOS, you can now add text to your queries.
Google says the new feature lets you conduct more complex and specific searches for better results. For instance, you can either capture or upload an image of a green dress, and then add the text “purple” to ask Google to find the item in a color you want. Or, you could take a picture of your rosemary plant and then add the query “care instructions.”
The launch comes as Apple is bringing its own smart search tool, called Visual Intelligence, to the iPhone 16 series. Visual Intelligence is basically a reverse image search combined with text recognition.
Google also announced that users can now free up space on their iPhones by saving files and pictures from the web to Drive and Photos directly from Chrome on iOS. You just have to select the “Google Drive” option when saving the file. The content will then be saved in a new Drive folder called “Saved from Chrome.”
To save an image from Chrome to Photos, you can long-press the picture and select the “Save in Google Photos” option.
In addition, Google is adding “Shopping Insights” on Chrome for iOS in the U.S. If you’re shopping for a product, Google will now in certain cases show you a “Good Deal Now” notification in the address bar to give you details about price history and more buying options.
Chrome is also getting a new feature that will let you view a map of an address in a single tap. If you’re browsing and see an address for a specific location, you will soon be able to tap the underlined address to view a mini-map of the location directly in Chrome."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/ftc-alleges-neobank-dave-misled-customers/,FTC alleges neobank Dave misled customers | TechCrunch,Cody Corrall,2024-11-12,"Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech! This week, we’re looking at neobank Dave’s “misleading marketing” according to a new FTC complaint, Affirm’s launch in the U.K. amid regulatory overhaul, and how Equal aims to combat India’s growing cyberfraud problem.
The FTC comes after Dave for “misleading marketing”
The FTC is taking action against online cash app and neobank Dave, which it says used “misleading marketing to deceive consumers.”
At issue is how Dave marketed $500 cash advances to consumers that it rarely offered, and the “Express Fee” it charged if customers wanted their money immediately. The FTC claimed Dave’s marketing implied that its cash advances would be “instant” without disclosing the fees involved until after the consumer gave Dave access to their bank account.
The complaint says that if the user chose not to pay the fee, which ranged anywhere from $3 to $25, they’d have to wait two to three business days for the transfer to go through. The FTC also alleged that Dave would sometimes charge a surprise fee, which it described as a “tip.”
Affirm has launched in the U.K., its first market outside North America.
The buy now, pay later (BNPL) giant’s long-anticipated arrival comes at an interesting point. U.K. lawmakers are mulling over new rules to bring BNPL firms into line with other traditional consumer credit services, but such laws aren’t expected to come into effect until at least 2026. That could give Affirm plenty of time to build traction and curry favor with consumers and regulators alike.
Affirm isn’t launching in the U.K. with any of the big-name partnerships it has back home, but the fact that it counts the likes of Amazon, Shopify, and Apple as customers in the U.S. means that it wouldn’t be a huge stretch to also expand its commercial partnerships across the pond.
Brazilian fintech Tako is emerging from stealth with a $13.2 million seed round co-led by Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Tako’s employee life cycle platform automates tasks like onboarding and payroll to save companies time and bring employee information into one place.
MoradaUno, a proptech company that aims to make it easier to rent apartments in Mexico, just raised a $5.6 million Series A round co-led by Flourish Ventures and Cometa. The funds will be used to help with expansion, co-founder and CEO Santiago Morales told TechCrunch.
Equal has raised a Series A round of $10 million at a post-money valuation of $80 million to scale its operations. The Hyderabad-based startup aims to address India’s growing cyberfraud problem with its suite of identity verification and financial data-sharing products."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/sam-bankman-fried-is-coming-to-the-big-screen/,Sam Bankman-Fried is coming to the big screen  | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-11-12,"Variety reports that Lena Dunham is working with Apple and production studio A24 to adapt Michael Lewis’ book “Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon,” which chronicles the life of Sam Bankman-Fried and the implosion of his company, FTX. She is set to write the script, the outlet said.
FTX, once one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, stunningly collapsed in 2022 in a saga that enthralled the tech world and resulted in the criminal indictment of Bankman-Fried for money laundering and fraud.
It was almost guaranteed he would get the Hollywood treatment, same as others, like Elizabeth Holmes, before him. Variety also reported that Amazon and another unnamed streamer are working on a limited series about Bankman-Fried and FTX, too."

The well-sourced analyst reported on Tuesday that the iPhone maker is working on an IP (internet protocol) camera with an expected 2026 shipping date. The analyst notes that Chinese component maker, Goertek, is set to assemble the product, which Apple expects to eventually hit tens of millions of units a year. The company would be a latecomer to an already sizable market that includes products from Google and Amazon.
Goertek is also expected to manufacture upcoming AirPod models, according to the rumor. The headphones are said to have an even broader focus on health features, following Apple’s expansion into hearing aid capabilities on the AirPods Pro 2."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/firefly-aerospace-readies-for-a-big-year-in-orbit-with-175m-d-round/,Firefly Aerospace readies for a big year in orbit with $175M D round | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-11-12,"Firefly Aerospace has raised a massive late-stage funding round as it prepares for the launch of its lunar lander later this year and the first mission of its Elytra spacecraft next year.
The $175 million Series D, which set Firefly’s valuation at over $2 billion, apparently closed in less than two months in a show of faith in the company’s new CEO — aerospace executive Jason Kim, who was installed in the position on October 1. Kim had previously led Boeing’s satellite maker Millennium Space Systems.
Firefly also plans to use some of the new capital to move to full rate production of its Alpha rocket and to accelerate development of the Medium Launch Vehicle it’s co-developing with Northrop Grumman. Firefly has launched Alpha five times since September 2021, though only three of these successfully placed the payloads in orbit. The company set a new record with the third Alpha mission in September 2023; called Victus Nox, the mission demonstrated rapid launch capabilities, with Firefly launching the Alpha rocket just 27 hours after receiving the green light from the U.S. Space Force. (The company has been tapped for a second “rapid response” mission to launch next year.)
The new capital will help Firefly meet the rest of the missions on the manifest, which include an agreement with L3Harris for up to 20 launches from 2027, and one with Lockheed Martin for 15 committed launches through 2029.
The latest raise was led by a new investor, RPM Ventures, with participation from existing investors and additional new investors GiantLeap Capital and Human Element. This later stage deal seems to be a bit of an exception for RPM, which says on its website that around 75% of its investments are in Series A stage companies.
The round stands out as one of the few sizable late-stage deals in the space sector this year, which has largely been dominated by activity in the seed and Series A stages, according to a recent report from U.K.-based firm Seraphim Space. This is in stark contrast to the period between 2019 and 2021, during which more than half of all venture funding was allocated to Series D+ companies."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/how-to-create-a-custom-emoji-with-genmoji-apple-intelligence-feature/,Here’s how to create a custom emoji with the Apple Intelligence feature Genmoji | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-11-12,"Apple’s latest iOS 18.1 software update introduced a series of Apple Intelligence features, including Writing Tools and notification summaries. However, some features were missing from the lineup, like Genmoji, which allows users to create emojis from written prompts.
Now, with iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 public betas officially available, the highly anticipated AI-generated Bitmoji feature is finally here for some users to try.
Here’s what you need to know about the Apple Intelligence feature that many people are excited about, whether you’re in Apple’s beta software program and want to take it for a test drive, or if you’re just curious about what to expect when Genmoji launches for all users.
Genmoji initially debuted at WWDC 2024 back in June. Built into the iPhone’s emoji keyboard, the feature lets people generate original emojis with prompts. For example, “A sloth wearing a suit and tie.” It can also generate emojis of people using photos. Genmojis can be used not only in Messages but also in Stickers and Tapbacks. It’s also possible to react to a message with a Genmoji or with Apple’s message effects.
To use Genmoji, first make sure Apple Intelligence is enabled. Then launch the Messages app, start a new message (or go to an existing chat), and click on the emoji keyboard located in the bottom left corner. Next, type the prompt into the search bar and choose “Create New Emoji” just below it.
After a few seconds, Apple Intelligence creates multiple versions of the AI-generated emoji based on that custom description. To save a favorite Genmoji, tap “Add” in the top-right corner to permanently include that new emoji to the keyboard.
To save a Genmoji that someone else sends, long press on it and select “Emoji Details,” which will display the prompt that was used to generate it. There’s also an option to download it.
Currently, Genmoji is only available to users with Apple’s iOS 18.2 public beta. Note that there may be a waitlist, so users might have to wait a few days or even weeks until they gain access.
It’s expected that the feature will officially launch in early December.
The only regions where Apple Intelligence is not supported are China and the EU because of certain regulations.
Regarding language support, it’s currently only available in U.S. English. In late 2024, it’ll roll out localized English support for Australia, as well as language support for users in Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. By 2025, Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will also become available."

The rollout of the autonomous vehicles, which Zoox CTO Jesse Levinson first announced at TechCrunch Disrupt, is a public show of force from the Amazon-backed company. Federal regulations prohibit the use of AVs built without human controls for commercial operations. Companies can apply for exemptions, but Zoox has not done so. The company says it has self-certified its AVs to be compliant with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s safety requirements, a claim that the agency is actively investigating.
The NHTSA would not provide comment on an active investigation.
Zoox plans to initially only ferry employees around the SoMa neighborhood of SF and on the Strip and surrounding areas of Vegas. In 2025, Zoox plans to test with early public riders as part of its “Zoox Explorer” program.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/dapr-graduates-to-become-a-cncf-top-level-project/,Dapr graduates to become a CNCF top-level project | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-11-12,"Dapr, the Microsoft-incubated open source runtime for helping developers build secure and resilient distributed applications, has graduated from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s (CNCF) pool of incubating projects to become a top-level project at the same level of projects like Kubernetes, Prometheus, Istio, and Vitess.
To graduate to this level, a project has to be stable, with clear documentation and a pool of active maintainers, but maybe just as importantly, it needs to have traction in the market.
“Dapr has a single mission: to meet the emerging needs of developers and solve the most complex problems in distributed computing,” said Yaron Schneider, who is a Dapr maintainer and Steering Committee member, as well as the CTO and co-founder of Diagrid, a startup that is commercializing Dapr. “The project has done very well in helping application developers navigate the complexities of cloud native architectures, and the engagement with the CNCF community proved to be an amazing catalyst for the project’s growth and maturity.”
When Dapr launched in late 2019, Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich told me that the company saw a need for a project that could take many of the developing patterns around distributed microservice-based applications and wrap them into a single runtime that would free developers from having to reinvent all of these patterns.
“In an era where traffic is king, Dapr has redefined distributed application development by helping developers focus on business logic, and significantly enhancing development efficiency,” said Loong Dai, a Dapr maintainer and Steering Committee member, as well as a cloud engineer at Intel. “As a core maintainer, I’m proud to see many FaaS frameworks and products leveraging Dapr as their runtime.”
The project was first accepted into the CNCF’s incubator in late 2021. Since then, it has been supported by over 3,700 individual contributors from more than 400 organizations, the CNCF said. Today, Dapr has tens of thousands of users, the organization says, including Grafana, HDFC Bank, and Vonage. In total, Dapr’s SDK has been downloaded over 70 million times.
“In today’s competitive environment, it’s more important than ever for organizations to be able to ship reliable and scalable applications quickly,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF. “Dapr provides a comprehensive solution for developing edge and cloud native applications, saving developers valuable time and freeing them to focus on innovating.”
Looking ahead, the Dapr community plans to include an alpha of a conversational AI API into the next release, which will then allow developers to work with LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral, among others. “The Dapr project’s goal is to continue innovating and providing common software patterns to developers building distributed applications,” the CNCF said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/snowflake-hackers-identified-and-charged-with-stealing-50-billion-att-records/,Snowflake hackers identified and charged with stealing 50 billion AT&T records | TechCrunch,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-11-12,"The U.S. government has accused Connor Moucka and John Binns of being the hackers who broke into the systems of AT&T, stealing around 50 billion customer call and text records.
In July, AT&T said hackers stole the phone records of “nearly all” of its cellular and landline customers, as well as calls and text message records — such as who contacted whom by phone or text — but not the content of the messages. At the time, AT&T said it would notify around 110 million AT&T customers of the breach and that the records were stolen from its systems hosted on Snowflake, a provider of cloud services for data analysis.
Until the Department of Justice’s indictment against the two hackers, which was filed on Sunday, the total number of stolen AT&T customer records was unknown.
The document does not mention AT&T. Instead, it mentions “Victim-2,” describing it as “a major telecommunications company located in the United States,” which was breached around April 14. When AT&T previously confirmed it was breached, it said the company learned of the hack on April 19. This means that both the description of what kind of company Victim-2 is, and the dates of its breach, align with what AT&T had publicly disclosed, making it almost certain that Victim-2 is indeed AT&T.
AT&T did not respond to a request for comment.
DOJ spokesperson Emily Langlie declined to comment.

Overall, according to the indictment, Moucka and Binns accessed “billions of sensitive customer records” and were successful in extorting at least three victims of at least 36 bitcoin (around $2.5 million when the victims paid) over the span of almost a year, from around November 2023 to October 10 of this year.
Prosecutors say Moucka, who lived in Canada, is also known online as “judische,” “catist,” “waif,” and “cllyels,” and Binns, who lived in Turkey, was known as “irdev”and “j_irdev1337.” Moucka was arrested in Canada last week. Binns was previously arrested in Turkey, according to 404 Media.
In August, Binns took credit for the AT&T breach with The Wall Street Journal. Moucka, through his moniker “Judische,” told 404 Media that he thought he’d be arrested soon.
AT&T is just one of several victims who had sensitive data stolen from their Snowflake instances. Over the last months, hackers also broke into Santander Bank, Ticketmaster, and around 165 other corporate customers. All these companies use Snowflake.
Prosecutors alleged that by breaking into the victim companies’ Snowflake instances, the hackers stole troves of sensitive personal and corporate data, including social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, passport numbers, and banking information, which makes these Snowflake-related breaches some of the worst cyberattacks of the year. In some cases, the hackers also asked victims for a ransom by threatening them with leaking the stolen information, threats that they followed up on at times.
Wired previously reported that AT&T paid a hacker $370,000 in an attempt to get them to delete the stolen records. Prosecutors said in the indictment that Victim-2 paid a ransom to the hackers.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/altos-ventures-an-early-backer-of-coupang-and-roblox-raises-500m-fund/,"Altos Ventures, an early backer of Coupang and Roblox, raises $500M fund | TechCrunch",Tage Kene-Okafor,2024-11-12,"Altos Ventures, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm that has backed the likes of Roblox, Coupang, PandaDoc, and Quizlet, has secured $500 million for its latest fund, according to SEC filings. The firm has been around for almost three decades and this is its largest fund to date.
Altos Ventures declined to comment on the filing or the new fund.
The multistage VC firm manages over 15 funds across three vehicles, according to PitchBook. They include Altos Ventures and Altos Hybrid funds, which invest in U.S. and global companies, as well as Altos Korea Opportunity Fund, which targets startups in South Korea. Altos Ventures has more than $7 billion in assets under management.
Altos Ventures specializes in enterprise and consumer software sectors, with a strong focus on SaaS, consumer and mobile. The firm prides itself on being the “first institutional investor in high-growth, founder-led companies.”
The new fund is notable because it’s a signal that well-established firms are continuing to raise substantial capital, despite the cooling in other parts of the venture market. Fundraising, for example, has become more challenging for emerging fund managers, many later-stage startups are struggling to raise growth rounds, valuations are softer overall (especially when the company in question is not an AI company), and the IPO market has been sluggish for years.
In contrast to the select group of venture capital firms that have scaled up to multibillion-dollar funds over the last decade, Altos has taken a more restrained approach, consistently capping its funds below $1 billion every few years. That’s more in the vein of Benchmark, which has also stayed conservative, raising a $425 million fund earlier this year and an additional $170 million partners-only fund.
For these firms, maintaining a strategy focused on making initial investments in a select number of early-stage startups—and later-stage bets in Altos’ case—has proven more effective than raising massive multibillion-dollar funds chasing FOMO deals during both the ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) and current AI investment booms.
Data from Cambridge Associates, which builds and manages investment portfolios for institutional investors, backs up this trend: Smaller funds have historically yielded higher returns. Reflecting this, CRV, a veteran venture firm over half a century old, recently returned more than half of its $500 million late-stage fund, citing the inflated valuations of mature startups.
Altos Ventures’ backers appear satisfied with the its investment strategy. The 28-year-old firm claims to have been the first and lead investor in more than 50 companies, with over a dozen portfolio companies going public or being acquired by publicly traded companies. To date, Altos has backed nearly 250 companies, according to PitchBook data."

The Alphabet-backed company said starting Tuesday anyone can download the Waymo One app to hail a ride in its service area, which is now about 80 square miles in Los Angeles County. Waymo has had a presence in Los Angeles since 2019, periodically coming in to map neighborhoods, including downtown, Miracle Mile, Koreatown, Santa Monica, Westwood, and West Hollywood. In 2022, the company announced Los Angeles would be one of its next commercial markets, following Phoenix and San Francisco.
Waymo wasn’t able to flip that commercial switch immediately, however. In August 2023 the company received the final permits required by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to operate a commercial service in San Francisco. In March 2024 Waymo was given approval from the CPUC to operate a commercial robotaxi service in Los Angeles as well expanded territory in the Bay Area that included the San Francisco Peninsula and San Francisco freeways. Waymo removed the waitlist for San Francisco riders in June. This latest expansion comes just a week since Waymo disclosed it raised $5.6 billion in a Series C funding round, led by parent company Alphabet. Andreessen Horowitz, Silver Lake, Fidelity, Tiger Global, Perry Creek, and T. Rowe Price all joined the round.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/particle-launches-an-ai-news-app-to-help-publishers-instead-of-just-stealing-their-work/,"Particle launches an AI news app to help publishers, instead of just stealing their work | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-11-12,"The media industry today may not have a very favorable view of AI — a technology that’s already been used to replace reporters with AI-written copy, while other AI companies have scooped up journalists’ work to feed their chatbots’ data demands, but without returning traffic to the publisher as search engines once did. However, one startup, an AI newsreader called Particle from former Twitter engineers, believes that AI could serve a valuable role in the media industry by helping consumers make sense of the news and dig deeper into stories, while still finding a way to support the publishers’ businesses.
Backed by $4.4 million in seed funding and a $10.9 million Series A led by Lightspeed, Particle was founded last year by the former senior director of Product Management at Twitter, Sara Beykpour, who worked on products like Twitter Blue, Twitter Video, and conversations, and who spearheaded the experimental app, twttr. Her co-founder is a former senior engineer at Twitter and Tesla, Marcel Molina.
From the consumers’ perspective, the core idea behind Particle is to help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology. More than just summarizing stories into key bullet points for quick catch-ups, Particle offers a variety of clever features that let you approach the news in different ways.
But instead of simply sucking up publishers’ work for its own use, Particle aims to compensate publishers or even drive traffic back to news sites by prominently showcasing and linking to sources directly underneath its AI summaries.
To start, Particle has partnered with specific publishers to host some of their content in the app via their APIs, including outlets like Reuters, AFP, and Fortune. These partners receive better positioning and their links are highlighted in gold above others.
Already, beta tests indicate that readers are clicking through to publishers’ sites because of the app’s design and user interface, though that could shift now that the app is launching beyond news junkies to the general public. In time, the company intends to introduce other ways to work with the media, too, in addition to sending them referral traffic. The team is also having discussions with publishers about providing its users access to paywalled content in a way that makes sense for all parties.
“Having deep partnerships and collaboration is one of the things that we’re really interested in,” notes Beykpour.
To help with its traffic referral efforts, the app’s article section includes big tap targets, making it easy for readers to click through to the publisher’s site. Plus, Particle includes the faces of the journalists on their bylines, and readers can follow through links to publisher profiles to read more of their content or follow them.
Using the app’s built-in AI tools, news consumers can switch between different modes like “Explain Like I’m 5,” to get a simplified version of a complicated story or those that summarize “just the facts,” (or the 5W’s — who, what, when, where, and why). You can have the news summarized in another language besides English, or listen to an audio summary of a story or a personalized selection of stories while on the go. Particle can also pull out important quotes from a story and other links of reference.
But two of the more interesting features involve how Particle leverages AI to help present the news from different angles and allows you to further engage with the story at hand by asking questions.
In Particle, one tool called “Opposite Sides” aims to break users’ filter bubbles by presenting different viewpoints from the same story. This model has been tried before by other news apps, including the startup Brief and SmartNews. Unlike earlier efforts, Particle includes a story spectrum that shows how news is being reported across both “red” and “blue”-leaning sites, with bubbles placed to indicate how far to the left or right the news’ positioning is, and how outsized the coverage may be from one side or the other. The AI will also summarize both sides’ positions, allowing news consumers to reach their own opinions about the matter.
However, the app’s killer feature is an AI chatbot that lets you ask questions and get instant answers about a story. The app will include suggested questions and those asked by others. For example, if you’re reading about Trump’s immigration policy plans, you could ask the chatbot things like “What are the potential legal challenges to Trump’s deportation plans?” or “What are the potential costs of mass deportation?” among other things. Particle will then use its AI technology to find those answers and fact-check them for accuracy.
“The chat function uses OpenAI as well as…our own pre-processing and post-processing,” explains Beykpour, in an interview with TechCrunch. “It uses the content, searches the web a little bit — if it wants to find extra information on the web — to generate those answers.” She says that after the answer is generated, Particle includes an extra step where the AI has to go find the supporting material that matches those answers.
Overall, the app encompasses tech like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, Anthropic, Cohere, and others, including more traditional AI technologies, which are not LLM-based, from Google.
“We have a processing pipeline that takes related content and summarizes it into bullet points, into a headline, sub-headline, and does all the extractions,” she continues. “Then…we pull out quotes and links and all sorts of relevant information about [the story]. And we have our own algorithms to rank, so that the most important or relevant link is the one that you see first — or what we think is the most important or relevant quote is the one that you see first.”
The company claims that its technology reduces AI accuracy problems that would otherwise occur one out of 100 times, and reduces their likelihood to one out of 10,000 times.
Particle will also use human editors as it grows to help better manage the AI content and curate its homepage, she notes.
The app is a free download on iOS for the time being and works across iPhone and iPad.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/tiktok-launches-integration-with-lemon8-as-us-ban-looms/,"TikTok launches integration with Lemon8, as US ban looms | TechCrunch",Aisha Malik,2024-11-12,"Users will be able to directly access Lemon8, ByteDance’s newer social media app, with their TikTok account, the company announced Tuesday. ByteDance says the integration will make photo sharing more feasible, and give creators the ability to cross-share photo content between the apps.
Lemon8 will remain a separate app, but the two platforms will share a unified user login, which means that creators can use one account to log in to both.
Lemon8 launched in Japan in 2020 and later expanded to markets across the U.S. and Southeast Asia. The app is similar to Instagram and Pinterest, as it lets users share slideshows, photo collections, and browse content through “Following” and “For You” feeds. Lemon8 offers users access to creative tools, filters, effects, stickers, text templates, and more.
“At TikTok, we are committed to continuously evolving our platform to better serve our creators,” the company wrote. “The integration of Lemon8 and other photo-sharing channels is a testament to our commitment to enhancing creators’ experience. We believe these new tools will inspire greater creativity and community-building, benefiting everyone involved.”
The announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as TechCrunch reported back in August 2023 that TikTok appeared to be working on an integration with Lemon8.
The feature arrives as TikTok is facing a ban in the United States. ByteDance is pushing Lemon8 as a sister app to TikTok, possibly as a way to move creators onto the new platform without having to get them to sign up for it separately.
However, it’s possible ByteDance’s other apps, including Lemon8, could get tangled up into the TikTok ban, especially since lawmakers’ main concern with TikTok is its Chinese ownership.
Of course, the recent election of Donald Trump could alter TikTok’s fate. Although Trump was the one to initiate calls to ban the app during his first term, the president-elect took a different approach during his 2024 campaign. He’s now concerned that a TikTok ban would benefit Meta, and had told voters to vote for him if they didn’t want the app to be banned.
The integration also comes as TikTok has been embracing photo content, despite originally gaining popularity with the short-video format. TikTok launched the ability to add photos in 2022, and the company started testing a dedicated photo-sharing app called TikTok Notes this year."

But major publications, such as Le Monde, Le Figaro, and Le Parisien, have collectively decided to take legal action against X over neighboring rights, according to a statement sent to Reuters and the AFP.
Under EU law, digital platforms are required to negotiate with publishers to remunerate them for news reuse. After a prolonged dispute, Meta and Google have signed deals with news publishers in France.
However, X has refused to engage in negotiations with news publishers to compensate them for reusing their content (or at least so far). As a result, judges at the Paris Court of Justice will now face the complex task of determining the value of article previews shared on X."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/localstack-raises-25m-to-help-developers-emulate-and-test-cloud-apps-locally/,LocalStack raises $25M to help developers emulate and test cloud apps locally | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-11-12,"Knowing how your cloud application will behave in production usually requires significant development and testing in the environment in which it will be deployed, be that AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or wherever. But this can be a resource-intensive endeavor, particularly with issues relating to latency (the time it takes to constantly send data) and the costs associated with this.
Swiss startup LocalStack has set out to address this by shifting the development process off the cloud and onto a developer’s local machine (i.e. their laptop), emulating the environment where it will go live. For now, its focus lies on AWS cloud apps, but the company is looking to ramp things up and go multi-cloud.
To back that strategy, the company on Tuesday said it has raised $25 million in a Series A round led by Notable Capital, one of the two entities that branched out of GGV Capital earlier this year.
For context, LocalStack started as an open source project while founder and co-CEO Waldemar Hummer (pictured above right, with co-founder Gerta Sheganaku, and Notable Capital managing partner Glenn Solomon) was at Atlassian in 2017. Initially, they were trying to help one of their Atlassian colleagues work while traveling into the office.
“We had a team member who was commuting on the train to work, and we wanted to get her productive even while being offline on the train,” Hummer told TechCrunch.
The idea germinated as a side project in the intervening years, with Hummer teaming up with Gerta Sheganaku, whom he’d known since his time at the University of Technology in Vienna in 2013, to drive early community adoption for the open source project. They launched as a full-time business in 2021, and after raising a small seed round, were later joined by a third co-founder, Thomas Rausch, who’s now head of engineering at the startup.
“What first got me excited about LocalStack was the increased adoption in the community, especially after LocalStack was publicly endorsed by Jeff Barr (AWS chief evangelist) — the GitHub Stars on the project saw a dramatic jump overnight and has been increasing ever since,” Sheganaku said. “By interacting with the community, we learned that some of the users were working in some of the largest companies of the world, trying to deploy LocalStack not only on their local machines, but also in their CI [continuous integration] pipelines.”
Today, the company counts some 900 paying users, including an impressive roster of self-serve customers including the likes of Apple, Comcast, IBM and Workday. LocalStack also works directly with some customers through an official procurement and onboarding process.
LocalStack’s offering consists of two core components: One is an emulator, which is basically a Docker image that the user downloads to their local machine with all the necessary AWS APIs. And the second part is a cloud platform, which serves access to additional features such as team collaboration, telemetry data, insights, and more.
The company has also retained some of its open source roots with a community version, making around one-third of its AWS services available through a public repository on GitHub. The additional two-thirds are held behind a private repository for paying customers. This community version serves as a useful tool for onboarding paying customers in the future, though that isn’t always the case.
“In many cases, community users sign up to LocalStack but do not become paying customers,” Sheganaku said. “We see many thousands of community users who have signed up for our web app, but not purchase any of the paid services.”
It’s worth noting that developers are already able to “mock out” certain parts of their infrastructure locally to run tests. There’s also popular frameworks like Testcontainers that can be used to simulate certain cloud services and infrastructure components on a local machine, though that usually has a different look, feel and “experience” to the actual cloud environment.
AWS itself also offers some tools to enable developers to emulate some of its services locally, such as AWS SAM, which supports the likes of AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and a few others. But LocalStack’s selling point is that it supports more than 100 core AWS services, including identity and access management (IAM) via Amazon Cognito, Amazon Kinesis data streams, and Amazon’s interactive query service Athena.
“LocalStack is almost like a drop-in replacement for AWS cloud,” Hummer said. “AWS SAM is really more specific to a certain set of services; LocalStack is much more comprehensive.”
LocalStack had hitherto raised an undisclosed $3 million in seed funding from CRV and Heavybit. Although it has operated largely under the radar, Hummer says it already has “substantial revenue numbers” and a global team of more than 50 operating mostly out of Europe. However, its customer base is substantively in the U.S., where it will now be looking to ramp things up in terms of product and go-to-market strategy — the fresh Series A round will help fund that effort.
For now, LocalStack’s core focus is AWS, though the company is also working on adding support for Snowflake, which is a different domain from that of AWS, but has similar challenges as it relates to cloud software development. Snowflake support remains in early-stage “preview” for now, but with the new $25 million in the bank, LocalStack is also gearing up to go multi-cloud, expanding support to Microsoft’s Azure, which Hummer said he hoped would be available some time in 2025.
“We’ve had a lot of requests for Azure,” Hummer said.
In addition to lead backer Notable Capital, LocalStack’s Series A round included participation from existing investors CRV and Heavybit."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/suse-launches-a-cloud-observability-service/,SUSE launches a cloud observability service | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-11-12,"Luxembourg-based SUSE has long offered various services around its various Linux- and cloud-centric infrastructure and security tools. Yet what the company didn’t really offer before was a more traditional SaaS product. That’s changing now with the early access launch of SUSE Cloud Observability, a fully managed observability platform designed for Rancher-managed multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters.
Rancher, SUSE CEO Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen told me, is a key growth engine for SUSE, with customers that include the U.S. government, for example.
“All these, all these vendors come with very complex, highly opinionated stacks where you have to follow the exact recipe of the vendor. That’s not what you want in an open source world, because you have people that know exactly what works best for them in what situation, and Rancher is a very fit-for-purpose component in that solution — and customers like that, especially in combination with the fast time to production,” van Leeuwen said.
It’s no surprise then that SUSE is doubling down on this part of its business with the launch of this new observability solution.
SUSE Cloud Observability, which is based on SUSE’s acquisition of StackState earlier this year, allows enterprises to monitor their workload in Rancher-managed clusters across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. To get users started, the service offers a set of pre-configured policies and dashboards.
“We were really missing a full stack observability solution,” van Leeuwen said. “We had some observability connectivity ability, but full-stack observability was — even if you look at how we were rated by Gartner and others — was really the missing piece in our overall Kubernetes solution. And adding it is a very important factor.”
Van Leeuwen also stressed that this is SUSE’s first SaaS-based service. “It’s also our first step into a software-as-a-service solution,” he said. “We didn’t have any SaaS. So it also takes us into that side of the business that is an important part of how customers like to consume software.” He also noted that there may be other solutions where this model may make sense for SUSE.
In addition to launching this new observability service, SUSE is launching its AI platform into general availability. The company first announced its AI services in June, with a focus on offering enterprises a vendor- and LLM-agnostic generative AI platform.
What customers are looking for with regard to AI is security and scalability, van Leeuwen said. SUSE, he stressed, is an infrastructure company at heart, so it’s not interested in deciding which large language model its users should deploy. “If you’re providing an infrastructure layer, then you’re effectively the guys who supplied the shovels and the diggers to the gold miners, without having to mine yourself, and that’s what we’re doing, in a way, for AI: making sure it runs perfectly and securely.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/this-usb-c-mouthpiece-turns-your-phone-into-a-woodwind-instrument/,This USB-C mouthpiece turns your phone into a musical instrument | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-11-12,"Artinoise, the Italian startup behind re.corder — a smart device reimagining the traditional plastic recorder we all played in school — has introduced its latest product: Zefiro.
The portable device, shaped like the mouthpiece of a recorder, can be plugged into any smartphone, tablet, or PC with a USB-C port, effectively transforming it into a musical instrument.
The Zefiro’s companion app offers around 32 different sound options, allowing them to emulate almost any instrument, from soft-pitched flutes and violins to brassy trumpets, saxophones, and even bagpipes. When the smart mouthpiece is connected, it’s recognized by the MIDI input, and the app displays an interface showing virtual buttons, keys, or wind holes. With lip sensors and a sensitive, miniaturized air pressure sensor, the Zefiro sends breath power data straight to the app, controlling the volume and pitch.
The company announced its Kickstarter campaign on Tuesday to support the launch, with an expected price of €22 ($23 USD) for backers. The expected retail price is €42 ($44).
The Zefiro instrument is being marketed as a MIDI breath controller and a digital instrument rolled into one. This type of product caters to a very specialized, expensive market, where wind MIDI controllers can be quite pricey, sometimes costing up to $900. While there are numerous digital instruments available, they are often also costly.
Zefiro’s companion app distinguishes itself by offering a variety of features, including built-in breathing exercises, sound layering, a looper function, background noises, and the ability to record and share audio clips. The app will be free to download on the App Store and Google Play Store. However, users must buy the Zefiro device in order to access its capabilities.
The company plans to introduce new features every two months, including the option for users to upload an image to customize the interface, enabling them to choose where to press buttons and which notes to play.
“Maybe they can put the face of someone they know, the button on the eye, on the cheeks, mouth, or whatever, or invent some kind of different instrument, and putting down the notes that they want to play,” Artinoise founder and CTO Davide Mancini told TechCrunch.
What makes the Zefiro particularly appealing is its design, which allows individuals with physical impairments, like those with respiratory issues, to play music. Mancini explained that the sensor is easy to use and doesn’t require much effort to breathe. Users with limited lung capacity can set the threshold low, so they only need to give a gentle blow.
Additionally, Artinoise plans to sell a separate headpiece so the Zefiro can operate hands-free. This can also work as a complementary instrument for performers who play the guitar or piano.
By making Zefiro’s technology open source, the company also hopes developers will build other accessibility-focused applications. For instance, disabled users could blow into the device to turn off smart lights.
The first round of products is anticipated to ship worldwide in late-January and early-February. There are two pending patents in the U.S. and Italy."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/europes-dma-forces-meta-towards-less-personalized-ads/,Europe's DMA forces Meta toward 'less personalized ads' | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-11-12,"Meta, under legal pressure in the European Union over a binary “pay us or consent to ad tracking” choice it currently offers regional users of its social networks Facebook and Instagram, is changing how its regional ad business works again. Little wonder when compliance failure in this context risks fines of up to 10% of its global annual turnover.
The adtech giant’s latest attempt to smuggle its surveillance ads machine past EU laws is an offer to display what it’s couching as “less personalized ads.” The European regulatory framework tightened earlier this year with the advent of the bloc’s flagship market contestability regulation (the Digital Markets Act, or DMA).
In a blog post announcing a shift within “weeks” to how it targets ads at EU users, which was first reported by the WSJ, Meta said that users in the region who opt not to pay a subscription fee it launched just over a year ago (for ad-free versions of its social media services) will soon be shown ads that use less personal data for “context”-based targeting than is currently the case. Right now, Meta leverages cross-service (and cross-site) tracking and profiling (also known as surveillance).
In other words, Meta is finally being forced to stop being quite so creepy about ads in the EU. Although the tech giant may be forced to go further still in the future when regulators reach a final decision on the DMA probe.
The data points Meta claims it will use for the “less personalized” ad targeting that’s incoming for regional users are slated to include “a person’s age, location, gender, and how a person engages with ads.”
Whether that will be enough to satisfy EU regulators remains to be seen. The bloc is expected to conclude its DMA probe next year. But it’s worth noting that Meta is also facing ongoing privacy challenges to its ad tracking model under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and consumer protection complaints too.
The core DMA legal issue for Meta is the law requires that, as a designated gatekeeper, it must obtain users’ consent for combining their personal data between designated core platform services (CPS) and other services. (It’s also GDPR consent standards that apply here.)
Both Facebook and Instagram are CPS — meaning that, since early March when DMA compliance kicked in, Meta has needed permission to track and profile service users’ activity in order to micro-target them with ads in the EU.
Thing is, Meta has not asked people’s permission for this pervasive tracking and profiling — it’s just offered a binary choice of accepting the surveillance or paying it a subscription fee for ad-free versions of the services.
The EU opened a DMA investigation of this binary choice in March. Then, in July, the Commission announced preliminary findings, saying it believes Meta’s “pay or consent” model does not comply with the rules.
The Commission’s investigation of Meta continues. But — in the meanwhile — the company has now made a fresh move to try to reconfigure its ad business in a way it claims meets regulators’ requirements.
“The changes we’re announcing today meet EU regulator demands and go beyond what’s required by EU law,” Meta wrote in the blog post, without offering any detail to back up the claim.
It also states that it “remain[s] steadfast in our view that personalized ads are the best experience for people and businesses.” So there’s some mixed messaging in its PR as Meta rails against making a business decision it prefers not to.
As well as reducing how much personal data it will use to target ads, Meta has announced it’s immediately cutting the cost of the ad-free subscriptions by 40%.
This will see the price of monthly subscriptions for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram fall from €9.99 to €5.99/month on web; and €12.99 to €7.99/month on mobile (iOS and Android). (NB: Meta claims the higher cost on mobile is a result of fees charged by Google and Apple through their app stores.)
People with more than one Facebook or Instagram account will be charged €4/month on the web and €5/month on iOS and Android for each additional account.
So Meta may be hoping to recover some revenue it may lose from having to run less-targeted ads by picking up some subs for ad-free versions of the services. (Its blog post suggests it will be degrading the user experience for users of the free versions of Facebook and Instagram in Europe by running unskippable ads that periodically take over the whole screen, which could drive some irritated users to shell out to go fully ad-free.)
Meta claims the lower pricing for the ad-free subscriptions (not the first time it’s discussed this price-drop, by the way) will make them “one of the cheapest across our peers.” Though what it’s basing that comparison on isn’t clear since rival social media services, like TikTok, remain free to access.
Asked about Meta’s announcements, the EU declined to offer a verdict while its DMA investigation continues.
Commission spokeswoman Lea Zuber told TechCrunch: “The new model introduced by Meta is under Meta’s sole responsibility, and it is neither endorsed by nor agreed with the Commission.”
It is too soon to speculate about the impact on the pending non-compliance proceedings, she added, noting: “Our objective is to bring Meta to full and effective compliance in this matter as soon as possible.”
This report was updated with a correction to the price-drop."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/nitrovolt-is-helping-farmers-make-their-own-fertilizer-using-renewable-power/,NitroVolt is helping farmers make their own fertilizer using renewable power | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-12,"When Suzanne Zamany Andersen arranged her trip to greenhouse grower Koppert Cress in the Netherlands, she thought she would just be pitching her startup’s device, which turns electricity and air into ammonia, a widely used fertilizer.
Not only did the company agree to test the ammonia production system made by her company — Denmark-based NitroVolt — it also referred her to its relatively new investment arm, Division Q, which ended up making an investment.
Once installed, NitroVolt’s device will produce ammonia that Koppert Cress will use to grow its crops (a range of different cress varieties), and it’ll use heat generated by the device to warm its greenhouses. “This is a perfect fit,” Andersen said the company told her.
The majority of the world’s ammonia is produced using the 115-year-old Haber-Bosch process, which is heavily reliant on natural gas. For growers like Koppert Cress, which wants to eliminate its carbon emissions by 2026, fertilizer represents a challenging source of pollution to zero out.
NitroVolt is one of a fresh crop of startups working to find alternatives to Haber-Bosch. The company starts by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules and separating nitrogen from the air. Then, it pumps hydrogen and nitrogen into a reaction chamber, where lithium helps attach the right number of hydrogens to each nitrogen atom. Ammonia emerges from the other side.
Ammonia is one of two nitrogen-based fertilizers that are broadly used throughout agriculture. “Certain crops really like ammonia, certain crops really like nitrates,” Andersen told TechCrunch.
The first farmer likely to pilot NitroVolt’s system is a rapeseed farmer in Denmark. “He swears by ammonia,” Andersen said.
But Denmark doesn’t currently have any ammonia production, so the farmer’s brother drives to Poland several times per year to procure it. “When he saw that we could do on-farm production, he was like, when can you sell me this unit?” Andersen said.
Denmark isn’t the only place where ammonia is hard to come by. Much of Africa, South America, and even parts of Canada are ammonia deserts. “There’s places where the logistics and distribution costs of centrally produced fertilizer is just really high,” Andersen said. “These markets, they’re not served by the current incumbent technology. So this is where we can essentially step in.”
NitroVolt’s pilot unit will produce about 5 kilograms of ammonia per day, but the startup has plans to incrementally boost production to 150 kilograms per day, enough to supply a typical farm in Denmark and the U.S. The whole operation would fit inside a standard 20-foot shipping container.
The startup raised a €2.75 million seed round led by BackingMinds and EIFO, the Danish sovereign wealth fund, to help build the pilot and hire staff to make it happen. Breakthrough Energy Fellows, Division Q, EQT Foundation, and Satgana participated, and BackingMinds underwrote a €750,000 convertible loan.
Andersen said that, if farmers have renewable energy on site, NitroVolt’s system can produce ammonia at a cost comparable to what they pay today. As more farmers adopt renewable energy, that could help tip the balance in favor of electrically-produced ammonia.
“We first started with farmers three years ago, they really didn’t have a lot of renewable energy on site,” she said. “Over the past three years, more than half the farmers we talked to either have solar on site, despite the fact that it’s basically never sunny in Denmark, or they have bought big wind turbines. It’s really a shift that’s happening.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/generative-ai-startup-writer-raises-200m-at-a-1-9b-valuation/,Generative AI startup Writer raises $200M at a $1.9B valuation | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-12,"Writer has raised $200 million at a $1.9 billion valuation to expand its enterprise-focused generative AI platform.
The Series C round was co-led by Premji Invest, Radical Ventures, and ICONIQ Growth, with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Adobe Ventures, B Capital, Citi Ventures, IBM Ventures, and Workday Ventures.
Writer CEO May Habib says the new cash, which brings the startup’s total raised to $326 million, will be used for product development and “cementing the company’s leadership in the enterprise generative AI category.”
“At Writer, we’re not just creating AI models that can execute tasks, but developing advanced AI systems that deliver mission-critical enterprise work,” said Habib in a statement. “With this new funding, we’re laser-focused on delivering the next generation of autonomous AI solutions that are secure, reliable, and adaptable in highly complex, real-world enterprise scenarios.”
Writer was founded in 2020 by Habib and Waseem AlShikh. The two previously launched Qordoba together, which helped companies localize products to new markets.
Writer has grown over the years into a full-stack generative AI platform, with products that can be customized for various enterprise use cases.
In 2023, Writer launched its own family of models, Palmyra, for text generation. Later that year, the firm debuted features that connect business data sources to its models, along with the ability for customers to self-host Writer-created models.
Just in October, Writer released a model, Palmyra X 004, trained almost entirely on synthetic data. Developing it cost just $700,000, Writer claims — compared to estimates of $4.6 million for a comparably-sized OpenAI model.
Writer’s current focus is on “AI agents” that can plan and execute workflows across systems and teams, as well as customizable AI guardrails and a suite of no-code development tools.
Despite the intense competition in the generative AI space, Writer has done quite well for itself. The company has hundreds of clients, including Mars, Ally Bank, Qualcomm, Salesforce, Uber, Accenture, L’Oréal, and Intuit.
“There’s a tremendous amount of engineering required to transform models into reliable business tools,” Patrick Stokes, EVP of product and industries marketing at Salesforce, said in a press release. “Writer provides a refined, AI-powered solution that’s effective, easy to deploy, and has rapidly accelerated our workflows here at Salesforce. We’re excited to join them on this journey not only as an investor, but also as a customer.”
Accenture, Balderton, Insight Partners, and Vanguard also participated in Writer’s Series C.
Writer’s latest funding is another sign venture capital’s enthusiasm for generative AI isn’t waning. According to a report from Accel, generative AI startups will get 40% of all VC cash poured into cloud technologies this year. And in the first half of 2024, investments in generative AI startups topped $3.9 billion, per PitchBook — not counting OpenAI’s $6.6 billion round.
The generative AI market is projected to surpass $1 trillion in revenue within the next decade. It faces headwinds, however, like privacy and copyright challenges, and architectural issues that cause phenomena like hallucinations.

Cloud expenditures more than doubled between 2019 and 2023, and are expected to eclipse $2 trillion by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs Research.
Poor spend management can put ROI at risk, however. Yodar Shafrir discovered this while working at Run:ai, the workload management startup Nvidia is attempting to acquire.
“I saw firsthand DevOps teams’ frustration due to resource inefficiencies,” Shafrir told TechCrunch. “I observed the high costs of unused resources and saw applications crashing due to the lack of sufficient resources. The constant pressure on engineering teams to fine-tune application resources often took time away from core development work.”
Guy Baron, who was head of R&D at Wix at the time, sympathized with Shafrir’s plight. He met Shafrir as a customer, and the pair got to talking. Months later, they decided to found a startup that focused on solving their shared problem: optimizing cloud resource usage.
That startup, ScaleOps, operates in a niche of cloud spend management tools known as FinOps. It’s a crowded niche, however, with competitors such as Broadcom-owned CloudHealth, IBM’s Kubecost and Cloudability, and startups like Exostellar, Ternary, CloudZero, and ProsperOps.
Like its rivals, ScaleOps tries to automate cloud management for companies based on the performance requirements of individual apps. ScaleOps analyzes an app’s requirements, taking into account available resources and cost considerations, and works to minimize the size of the app’s cloud services footprint.
ScaleOps, which is self-hosted, can run on any cloud, on-premise, or air-gapped environment, said Shafrir (CEO).
“ScaleOps automates resource optimization to reduce waste, improve performance, and streamline workflows between DevOps, FinOps, and application teams,” he added. “This value proposition resonates strongly with companies seeking to optimize their operations during economic downturns.”
To Shafrir’s point about resonance, ScaleOps’ customer base (which includes SentinelOne, Cato Networks, and Wiz) seems to be expanding healthily: He expects the roster to grow to over 100 brands by the year’s end.
That traction has also helped the startup attract investment. This month, the company closed a $58 million Series B funding round that brought its total capital raised to $80 million.
Shafrir wouldn’t disclose details of ScaleOps’ revenue and burn rate, but he said the company maintains “a prudent financial strategy” to “ensure sustainability and growth.”
It’s certainly to ScaleOps’ benefit that FinOps has gone mainstream. According to a recent survey, more than four in five companies now have a formal FinOps team in place, and another 16% are actively considering adding one. Seventy-one percent of respondents to the same survey said that their investment in FinOps increased last year.
“The broader slowdown in the tech industry has heightened the focus on operational efficiency and cost optimization,” Shafrir said.
Lightspeed Venture Partners led ScaleOps’ Series B, the proceeds from which will be put toward growing the New York-based company’s headcount from 60 people to more than 200 by 2026. NFX, Glilot Capital Partners, and Picture Capital also participated in the round.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/aws-attempts-to-lure-ai-researchers-with-110m-in-grants-and-credits/,Amazon attempts to lure AI researchers with $110M in grants and credits | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-12,"There’s an AI chip battle brewing among the major cloud vendors. Google’s Trillium, a custom chip for training and running AI models, recently entered preview, and Microsoft’s Maia is expected to follow in short order.
Not to be outdone, Amazon Web Services has AI chips, too: Trainium, Inferentia, and Graviton. In an effort to draw attention to Trainium in particular, the company is launching a new grant program for AI research.
Called Build on Trainium, the new program will award $110 million total to institutions, scientists, and students researching AI. AWS will give up to $11 million each in Trainium credits to universities with which it has strategic partnerships, along with individual grants up to $500,000 to the broader AI research community.
AWS also says that it’s establishing a “research cluster” of up to 40,000 Trainium chips research teams and students can access through self-managed reservations.
Gadi Hutt, senior director at AWS’ Annapurna Labs, a chipmaking firm AWS acquired in 2015, said that Build on Trainium is intended to furnish researchers with the hardware support they need to pursue their work. Grant participants will also be connected with Trainium educational resources and enablement programs, Hutt added.
“AI academic research today is severely bottlenecked by a lack of resources and, as such, the academic sector is falling behind quickly,” Hutt said. “With Build on Trainium, AWS is investing in a new wave of AI research guided by leading AI research in universities that will advance the state of generative AI applications, libraries, and optimizations.”
Indeed, academics in the AI field lack the considerable infrastructure tech giants have at their disposal. Meta, for example, has procured well over 100,000 AI chips to develop its flagship models. In contrast, Stanford’s Natural Language Processing Group has 68 GPUs for all of its work.
But not everyone believes that AWS will be a benevolent sponsor.
“This feels like an effort on generalizing a corruption of academic research funding,” Os Keyes, a PhD candidate at the University of Washington who studies the ethical impact of emerging technologies, told TechCrunch.
With Build on Trainium, AWS will have the final say on which projects receive grants. The selection process is opaque; Hutt would only say AWS will allocate funds “based on research merit and needs” and “evaluate program success and outcomes.”
An AWS spokesperson later clarified that a committee of “AI and application practitioners” will review proposals and select “the most impactful and promising projects that will help advance machine learning science forward.”
There’s evidence suggesting corporate-backed AI research tends to favor work with commercial applications over other areas of study. In a recent paper, researchers found that leading AI firms have significantly lower output for research critically examining AI’s ethical implications compared to conventional studies. Moreover, the “responsible” AI research big firms do is narrower in scope, according to the co-authors, and lacks diversity in the topics addressed.
Researchers have pushed for legal and technical protections to scrutinize AI without fear that vendors will suspend their accounts or threaten legal action.
Build with Trainium is advertising for, well, Trainium. But is AWS’ other angle trying to woo researchers to its platform? I asked whether grant recipients will be “locked in” to the AWS ecosystem or Trainium if they accept an award. Hutt said they won’t, and that the only requirements they’ll have to meet are publishing a paper and “open sourcing” their work on GitHub under a permissive license.
“There is no contractual lock that makes universities exclusive technology partners,” he said. “What we ask in return is that the outcomes of the research will be open sourced for the benefit of the community.”
In any event, it’s not clear Build with Trainium will do much to bridge the gap between AI academia and industry.
In 2021, U.S. government agencies, aside from the Department of Defense, allocated $1.5 billion for academic funding for AI research. That same year, AI industry worldwide spent more than $340 billion overall (not just for research).
Nearly 70% of people with PhDs in AI end up in private industry, lured not only by competitive salaries but access to essential compute and data (and the means to process it). In recent years, companies have ramped up their poaching of faculty AI researchers, and set aside larger grants for PhD students performing research.
The end result? The largest AI models developed in any given year now come from industry more than 90% of the time, while the number of AI papers published with industry co-authors has nearly doubled since 2000.
Policymakers have taken some steps to address the academia-industry funding gap. Last year, the National Science Foundation announced a $140 million investment to launch seven university-led National AI Research Institutes to examine how AI could mitigate the effects of climate change and improve education. Elsewhere, efforts are underway to establish the U.S. National AI Research Resource, a $2.6 billion initiative that’d provide AI researchers and students with access to computational resources and datasets.
But they’re still small time compared to corporate programs. And there’s little reason to think that the status quo will change anytime soon."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/general-catalyst-and-khosla-ventures-back-data-mapping-startup-lume/,General Catalyst and Khosla Ventures back data mapping startup Lume | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-11-12,"Data integration is a necessary part of many workflows from onboarding customer data to exercising payroll, but for many data sets the process is long and manual. Data is siloed into databases and SaaS applications that each keep the information in different formats, which makes it difficult to move information from one database to another. Lume looks to change that using AI.
Lume’s system uses AI and algorithms to automate data mapping by extracting data from its database silos and “normalizing” it, meaning it converts it into a standardized format so that it can be more easily moved or integrated into other workflows. If a data integration breaks in the process, a common problem, Lume notifies users and uses AI to try to remediate the issue. Lume also offers an API and a web platform so clients can embed Lume directly into their workflows.
What sets Lume apart from other data mapping tools is that it isn’t focused on extracting data from a spreadsheet or PDF but rather on complex nested data formats like JSON. Lume can help companies map complex arithmetic, taxonomy and text manipulation tasks, Nicolas Machado, Lume co-founder and CPO, told TechCrunch. He added that this focus allows companies to spend less time and money than outsourcing these data projects.
“One of the core problems that we saw is that moving data seamlessly, like truly seamlessly between systems, is a completely manual process, and has been for literally 60 years,” Machado said. “Why can’t this be automated? Why was it never possible before? It’s because data is unique to every single system. Each company, each vendor, each integration, they’re defining data in their own way. They’re structuring data in their own way. They understand the data differently.”
Machado and his co-founders, Robert Ross and Nebyou Zewde, know the problem well. The trio met as freshmen at Stanford, studying computer science with a focus on AI. From there, they went off to work at tech companies ranging from Apple to OpenDoor, they all were involved in data integration projects. In 2022, when the founders saw the writing on the wall for advancements in AI, they decided it was the right time to try to solve this data integration issue.
“Every engineer has faced this problem,” Machado said. “Every engineer has to do it. So we got started, we got together, literally went to one of my co-founder Robert’s apartment, and we would work the evenings on it.”
Lume was founded in January 2023, launched its first product in March 2023, and went through Y Combinator’s W23 batch. Machado said the company has had strong inbound demand ever since and has racked up dozens of customers so far. Machado said Lume’s customers range in size from startups to enterprise companies, but declined to share specifics.
Lume recently raised a $4.2 million seed round led by General Catalyst with participation from Khosla Ventures, Floodgate, and Y Combinator in addition to angel investors.
“They really understand this problem, and that’s why they were hooked on it,” Machado said. “That’s why they’re excited about it. They were operators. Like, ‘wait, I was a CEO 30 years ago, and this was a problem. This still a problem? That’s insane.’”
Machado said that the round will be used for hiring, the company wants to double its headcount from five to ten by the beginning of next year, and for continuing to work on the tech.
Lume isn’t the only company looking to fix data integration woes. SnapLogic is one that has raised $371 million in venture funding. Osmos is another startup looking to help companies with this. As engineers continue to deal with this issue, competition will likely grow. Machado said he isn’t worried about competition though as he thinks Lume’s algorithms, and how its API brings Lume into company’s existing workflows, will help it stand apart.
In the future, Lume hopes to be the glue that sits between any two data systems and can seamlessly facilitate the flow of data between the two.
“We all love data, and we’re all big believers in how important data is,” Machado said. “That metaphor we use, it’s like oil, oil, historically, to extract value you have to process it and then use it to power machines, everything else. That’s exactly what data is and what data has been.”
This piece has been updated to clarify Machado’s title and Lume’s customer base."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/how-two-brothers-went-from-growing-up-on-a-sailboat-to-making-underwater-military-vehicles/,How two brothers went from growing up on a sailboat to making underwater military vehicles  | TechCrunch,Margaux MacColl,2024-11-12,"Vatn Systems founders Nelson and Freddie Mills spent their childhood cruising over turquoise waters, doing their homework on a sailboat off the coast of Caribbean islands. While their surroundings were idyllic, their vessel of choice was decidedly not. “The first boat I remember, I think our parents bought it for like five, 10 grand,” Freddie said. “It didn’t have refrigeration. It was leaky.”
But it turns out an unreliable ship is a great place to raise future engineers. The brothers, who spent several months of each year on a sailboat, would occasionally put down their homework and pick up a wrench, helping their father jerry-rig mechanical solutions. “We didn’t have enough money to rebuild an engine, so my dad and I and Nelson, we just figured it out,” Freddie said.
After spending years on the water, the brothers have now turned their ambitions to just below the ocean’s surface. Last year, the two paired up with engineer Geoff Manchester and Dan Hendrix, a former special forces dive team officer, to found Vatn Systems, a startup producing autonomous underwater vehicles primarily for defense uses. On Tuesday, the Portsmouth, Rhode Island-based company announced a $13 million seed round led by DYNE Ventures and with participation from Lockheed Martin Ventures, RTX Ventures, In-Q-Tel, and others. The round brings the startup’s total funding to $16.5 million.
The company’s vehicles — the first prototype is about 50 pounds — can swim within the top 300 meters of water and carry weapons like torpedoes. The vehicles have other uses as well, like passing messages between ships in areas where signals are blocked by adversaries. To do so, a string of Vatn vehicles autonomously get into position and send data down the line of drones to a ship, with the communication happening out of enemy sightline. “Our ultimate goal is to become an underwater autonomy prime,” Nelson said.
Vatn also plans to capitalize on the Department of Defense’s current obsession: swarming technology, meaning a large group of drones that a single military officer can operate at once. While there are plenty of startups building aerial drone swarms, Vatn wants to be the government’s answer for underwater swarms. Right now, a single user can operate about 10 Vatn vehicles. “Eventually it’ll be like hundreds,” Nelson said.
Vatn will face well-capitalized competition. Defense juggernaut Northrop Grumman has built its own underwater vehicle prototype, Manta Ray, and the Pentagon selected defense startup Anduril to continue producing its own autonomous underwater device. Nelson argued that Vatn aims to make its vehicles less expensive and easier to mass-produce than competitors.
The brothers have a long road ahead, expanding their 18-person team and going to market in 2025. But, by setting up shop right on Rhode Island’s Narragansett Bay, the pair has ensured they will never stray too far from their seafaring roots. “I’m staring at my sailboat right now,” Freddie said with a smile, looking onto the dock beside Vatn’s office."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/apples-geoblocks-on-media-services-in-eu-draw-consumer-protection-ire/,Apple's geoblocks on media services in EU draw consumer protection ire | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-11-12,"Apple’s pile of regulatory woes in the European Union has ticked up again: The iPhone maker is being accused of unlawfully discriminating against consumers by applying restrictions on how several of its media services can be accessed around the bloc.
Consumer protection authorities in three EU Member States have been investigating the geoblocking measures (access restriction) that Apple applies to services, including Apple Music, iTunes Store, and App Store for several months.
The European Commission and the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network, which coordinates joint actions by national consumer protection authorities, announced in a press release Tuesday that Apple has been notified of concerns about “several potentially prohibited geo-blocking practices.”
If Apple fails to address the CPC Network’s concerns, it could face enforcement under EU consumer protection law, where penalties can reach up to 4% of global annual turnover.
The European Union has rules that aim to promote the free movement of services, and rules against unjustified geoblocking — both are involved here, as they prohibit discrimination against consumers based on where they live.
The full list of Apple media services where concerns are being flagged by CPC Network Members in Belgium, Germany, and Ireland is a follows: App Store, Apple Arcade, Music, iTunes Store, Books, and Podcasts.
Issues include:
“The Geo-blocking Regulation prohibits unjustified discrimination between EU customers on the basis of their nationality, residence, or place of establishment when they want to buy goods and services from traders located in a different Member State,” the CPC Network wrote in the press release. “The Services Directive requires that general conditions of access to a service do not contain discriminatory provisions relating to the nationality or place of residence of the service recipient, unless directly justified by objective criteria.”
Apple has been given one month to reply to the Network’s findings and propose commitments to address the issues.
The intervention could lead to a dialogue between the CPC Network and Apple, which could put an end to the case if Apple makes sufficient changes that resolve the concerns, such as removing the geoblocks.
However if Apple fails to reply — or if its reply is not deemed to fully address the CPC’s concerns — consumer protection authorities could take enforcement action at the national level.
Apple has been contacted for comment."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/red-hat-acquires-ai-optimization-startup-neural-magic/,Red Hat is acquiring AI optimization startup Neural Magic | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-12,"Red Hat, the IBM-owned open source software firm, is acquiring Neural Magic, a startup that optimizes AI models to run faster on commodity processors and GPUs.
The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.
MIT research scientist Alex Matveev and professor Nir Shavit founded Somerville, Massachusetts-based Neural Magic in 2018, inspired by their work in high-performance execution engines for AI.
Neural Magic’s software aims to process AI workloads on processors and GPUs at speeds equivalent to specialized AI chips (e.g. TPUs). By running models on off-the-shelf processors, which usually have more available memory, the company’s software can realize these performance gains.
Big tech companies like AMD and a host of other startups, including NeuReality, Deci, CoCoPie, OctoML, and DeepCube, offer some sort of AI optimization software. But Neural Magic is one of the few with a free platform and a collection of open source tools to complement it.
Neural Magic had so far managed to raise $50 million in venture capital from backers like Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise Associations, Amdocs, Comcast Ventures, Pillar VC, and Ridgeline Ventures.
Red Hat CEO Matt Hicks said Neural Magic’s work on vLLM, an open source project for model serving, was of particular interest to Red Hat. With Neural Magic, the open source company is benefiting from a vLLM-based “enterprise-grade” stack that allows customers to optimize and deploy models across cloud environments, Hicks said, with full control over infrastructure and security.
Red Hat is already involved in the vLLM project, which it leverages to run models in products like Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI and Red Hat OpenShift AI. Hick said through the combined work of Red Hat and Neural Magic, its infrastructure partners will be able to better scale AI across platforms, and its integrated service provider partners will gain more robust inference and performance to integrate with their offerings.
“AI workloads need to run wherever customer data lives across the hybrid cloud; this makes flexible, standardized and open platforms and tools a necessity, as they enable organizations to select the environments, resources and architectures that best align with their unique operational and data needs,” Hicks said in a statement. “We’re thrilled to complement our hybrid cloud-focused AI portfolio with Neural Magic’s groundbreaking AI innovation, furthering our drive to not only be the ‘Red Hat’ of open source, but the ‘Red Hat’ of AI as well.”
Red Hat’s acquisition of Neural Magic comes as the company makes a number of AI-related announcements at KubeCon, the annual computing conference, in Salt Lake City this week. Red Hat also unveiled Climatik, a tool developed in collaboration with Intel, Bloomberg and IBM to optimize data center energy efficiency, and new releases of its OpenShift AI and Device Edge development platforms.
As the power demands and costs of creating and deploying AI increase, big tech providers have moved to snatch up firms with products that could help optimize AI algorithms. In April, Nvidia acquired Run:ai, a company that makes it easier for devs to manage and optimize their AI infrastructure. And in October 2020, Intel bought SigOpt, a specialist in modeling optimization.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/pointfive-snaps-up-20m-for-breakthrough-tech-to-track-usage-across-multiple-clouds/,PointFive snaps up $20M for breakthrough tech to track usage across multiple clouds | TechCrunch,Ingrid Lunden,2024-11-12,"Enterprise spending on cloud services continues to go up, up, up — to the tune of $675 billion this year — thanks to organizations’ firm embrace of software-as-a-service, the popularity of distributed working, and the arrival of compute-intensive tech like AI.
A startup called PointFive believes it has found a better way to get a grip on that usage, and on Tuesday it announced $20 million in funding from an impressive list of backers to help it square up to the market.
New investor Salesforce Ventures is leading the Series A, with Index Ventures, Entree Capital, Sheva VC, and Vesey Ventures also participating. The company, headquartered in New York but founded out of the Israeli tech scene, has a long list of angel-founders who have taken a similar route themselves. They include Assaf Rappaport of Wiz, Mickey Boodaei, Tamar Yehoshua, Yasmin Lukatz, Dean Sysman, Raanan Raz, Kfir Tishbi, and Amiram Shachar — who himself is raising a $100 million round for his current startup, the cloud security firm Upwind.
The round is also notable for how quickly it has come on the heels of its seed round. The company is only around 18 months old and announced $16 million in June 2024 (bringing the total raised now to $36 million). We understand that PointFive’s valuation is now in the region of $100 million.
Coincidentally, one of the angel investors, Shachar, made his name with a cloud cost optimization tool called Spot, which he eventually sold to NetApp before starting Upwind. It’s the opposite story with PointFive’s CEO and co-founder, Alon Arvatz, who previously founded a security startup, IntSights, which he sold to Rapid7 for $350 million before founding PointFive in cloud optimization.
This is because in the cloud, security and cost control are really two sides of the same coin: Both need the same data on usage across instances, apps, and endpoints to operate. That was also the impetus for founding PointFive. Arvatz said he realized with his previous startup that it was a challenge to sell cloud security to teams who were under pressure to explain why they needed quite so much of it, when they couldn’t show to finance where cloud spend was going in the first place.
Arvatz said in an interview that Shachar has now become the go-to in Israel for any investor doing due diligence before backing a startup in the cloud cost space, which was how he came to be an investor himself in this company. Shachar thought that “we are the next big thing in the space,” Arvatz claimed.
As for what that “next big thing” is, as Arvatz describes it, previous cloud cost optimization solutions have been limited in scope, focusing on one particular cloud platform (Spot, for example, helped provide visibility on AWS) and tracking basic usage on that platform across a wide array of apps and services.
However, the reality of how organizations engage in cloud services is very different. Typically they have hybrid architectures in place, using multiple clouds, combined with warehousing solutions like Snowflake and more.
PointFive’s breakthrough, in Arvatz’s view, is tech that can do that more comprehensively across silos.
“We were able to build the technology to collect and ingest various data points from the cloud providers,” he said. “Plus, we’re the only ones in the industry [that have] developed an agent-less Kubernetes solution. So today, within five minutes, we can give you all the data around your cloud infrastructure and everything you need to know about your Kubernetes clusters.”
Alongside this, he said, PointFive’s research team has developed AI algorithms to identify what the company describes as “Deep Waste” — the cost-control equivalent (sort of) of deep learning.
“Traditionally, waste in cloud environments was unused resources,” he said. “You pay for certain resources, but you don’t use them, or use only half of them. When you have a containerized environment and a lot of managed services for storage, when networking is a huge cost and networking is very influenced by architecture, you have tons of waste that is very, very deep and hard to identify. This is where you need very sophisticated algorithms to actually map them out and do this ongoing monitoring.”
This may not be the case forever, but for today, PointFive says it’s the only company out there that can map this, and mapping it is step one to remediating.
This is particularly important in newer areas like AI, where there are genuine compute constraints and high costs.
It’s interesting to see Salesforce Ventures leading this round. The company is a leader in SaaS services, so to help upsell more products to its customers, having a solution to make them feel more empowered is definitely in its favor. Also, as Salesforce continues to add more cloud apps for use cases well beyond sales and marketing, you could imagine it becoming more interested in cloud management and security down the line, too.
“We are excited to support the acceleration of PointFive’s platform and look forward to seeing the value they bring to customers through multi cloud coverage,” said Nowi Kallen, managing director at Salesforce Ventures, in a statement."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/germanys-klim-raises-22m-to-take-its-regenerative-farming-platform-international/,Germany's Klim raises $22M to take its regenerative farming platform international | TechCrunch,Mike Butcher,2024-11-12,"Global food production generates at least a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, more than 80% of which comes from agriculture. But addressing that impact is easier said than done since there are simply so many moving parts to address.
“Regenerative” farming is often touted as one way to make progress toward several sustainability goals, as it offers farmers an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions while increasing biodiversity and enriching soil. That directly impacts food production, and therefore, food supply.
Berlin-based agritech startup Klim is working to get farms to switch to regenerative farming more easily, and to help expand its operations internationally, the startup recently secured a $22 million Series A funding round led by Europe’s largest bank, BNP Paribas. Notably, the round is one of the largest raised by agritech startups in Europe this year.
With Klim, farmers get tools to plan, execute, and finance the transition to regenerative practices. This includes data on restoring soil health, biodiversity, capturing carbon, and reducing emissions.
Farmers can also use Klim’s platform to track the progress of their transition and prove it to supply chain partners, enabling them to earn revenue payouts for sequestered carbon. Klim then takes a commission on the sale of carbon “insets” linked to supply chains, and farmers can generate revenue from these by selling them on Klim’s marketplace.
In turn, food companies can buy these “ecosystem services” to make their supply chains greener, especially as emissions reporting requirements increase. In other words, a farmer gets paid for “farming carbon” as much as raising and selling crops or cattle.
Klim was founded in 2020 in Berlin by Robert Gerlach, Nina Mannheimer, and Adiv Maimon, and in the past four years, the startup says it has served 3,500 farmers, which equates to 700,000 hectares of land, representing 5% of German farmland. Its clients now include agriculture giants like Nestlé, Kaufland, and Aryzta.
Speaking to TechCrunch, Gerlach (CEO) said that given the world is gradually losing more soil, and many global soils have already lost 50% of their original organic carbon stock, “there’s a real urgency to transition farmland to regenerative practices.”
“You need to do two things to get a farmer to regenerative agriculture. The first is a digital agronomist that shows them how to best start for their particular farm’s context. This includes how to minimize the risk, for example, starting with only 5% of the farm, choosing the right methods,” Gerlach said.
He said the second thing is to quantify the impact: “We do that with a mix of satellite data, soil samples, and primary data that the farmer has to put into the platform, which then all goes into a certified model. That quantifies the emission removals and reductions. But it would be a misunderstanding to say we are used for carbon offsets.”
“What companies like Nestlé really need is reliability. Supply chains are degrading, meaning harvests are less predictable. This is really problematic for the food companies,” he added.
The new funding will be used to expand the company’s operations outside of Germany.
Klim is not alone in this space, especially in Europe, where agritech is a well-developed sector. For instance, Agricarbon, based in Dundee, Scotland, measures and validates soil carbon capture and storage for farms and carbon markets, and it has raised over €14 million. Another competitor, Regrow, has raised $63.6 million, while Soil Capital has raised €5 million.
“Klim’s innovative platform and approach to scaling regenerative agriculture are perfectly aligned with our commitment to financing solutions that mitigate climate change, make the ecosystems more resilient and improve people’s livelihoods,” Maha Keramane, head of BNP Paribas’ Positive Impact Business Accelerator, said in a statement.
Klim’s Series A round also saw participation from Earthshot Ventures, Rabobank, AgFunder, Norinchukin Bank, Achmea, Ananda Impact Ventures, and Elevator Ventures — the VC arm of Raiffeisen Bank International. In 2022, the startup closed a $6.6 million seed round that was led by Berlin-based food and green tech investor, Green Generation Fund."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/conduktor-aims-to-gatekeep-bad-data-out-of-companys-apps/,Conduktor looks to gatekeep 'bad data' out of company's apps | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-12,"It was 2020, and Nicolas Orban, Stéphane Derosiaux, and Stéphane Maarek were beyond frustrated with Apache Kafka. The tool for handling real-time data streams simply couldn’t keep up with the trio’s engineering needs — particularly during the pandemic, when companies were rushing to embrace cloud services.
“Many companies were finding it difficult to scale their data operations,” Orban told TechCrunch. “And they were struggling to tap the full potential of their data, leaving vast amounts unused or siloed.”
After noodling around for a bit, Orban, Derosiaux, and Maarek concluded that Kafka, cumbersome as it was, wasn’t a total loss. It might work, they thought, if you could spruce it up with some tooling.
So they decided to build the tooling.
The trio called that tool Conduktor, and over the years, it has evolved into a fully-fledged platform for streaming data management — one that can intercept and filter data according to a company’s policies before it reaches its final destination.
Conduktor essentially acts as a gatekeeper for data, Orban (the startup’s CEO) said, preventing “bad data” — corrupt, skewed, or otherwise incomplete data — from polluting downstream applications. This could be data for real-time analytics, for example, or predictive maintenance.
“Customers have struggled with the data explosion, under-utilization, and technical hurdles that come with scaling real-time data,” Orban said. “We now work with some of the largest companies in the world, as they are the most impacted by these challenges.”
Companies can monitor their data streams using Conduktor, or they can share them with third parties via Conduktor Exchange, which lets organizations serve specific streams externally for data licensing.
The tool runs on a company’s infrastructure, and can enforce data masking and access controls to ensure that a company’s data handling practices align with regulations like GDPR.
This month, Conduktor closed a $30 million Series B funding round led by RTP Global, with participation from Ansa, M12 (Microsoft’s venture fund), and Accel.
Conduktor has competition in the space (like Immerok), but the startup has grown at a rapid clip, tripling its annual recurring revenue in the past year. The startup counts DraftKings and Lufthansa as customers, and expects to double its 60-person team by 2026.
“As streaming is inevitable for digital innovation, the demand for an enterprise data management platform continues to rise,” Orban said, citing a Fortune Business Insights report that estimates the market for stream processing to grow to $185 billion by 2032.
The fresh cash, which brings the New York-based company’s total capital raised to $52 million, will be put toward general expansion and product development, Orban said."

The highlight of the update is a new “Calls” tab, which lets you make new calls, manage call links, and check your call history.
The tab lets you create links for calls, so instead of creating a group, you can just share the link with people — similar to how Meet, Zoom, and Teams function. The links are reusable, so you can use them for recurring meetings as well.
You also get commonly seen management features like the ability to name calls, manually allow people join meetings, or kick, remove, and block them. Participants can queue up to ask questions through a Meet-esque hand-raising feature.
People using Signal’s desktop app can switch between grid, sidebar, or speaker views.
Signal introduced encrypted group video calls in 2020 and currently supports groups of up to 50 people. Rival WhatsApp started letting people share links to calls in 2022, and this June added screen sharing, speaker spotlight, and support for 32-people video calls.
“Video calls have become a new normal meeting place for organizations, workplaces, and groups of friends all over the world. As communication norms change, Signal’s promise of a private place to communicate stays the same. To make Signal calling better overall, we’ve spent the last few months building some welcome improvements,” the company said in a blog post.
Signal is rolling out the feature on its iOS, Android, and desktop apps."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/fleek-a-marketplace-for-wholesale-second-hand-clothes-sews-up-20m/,"Fleek, a marketplace for wholesale secondhand clothes, sews up $20.4M | TechCrunch",Ingrid Lunden,2024-11-12,"Secondhand clothing has exploded as a category over the past couple of decades. A London startup that’s built a first-of-its-kind platform to improve how this very fragmented industry operates is now announcing funding to double down on the opportunity.
Fleek, an online marketplace that connects secondhand clothing wholesalers with those that sell it at retail, has raised $20.4 million ($14.8 million Series A and $5.6 million seed announcing for the first time today) to continue expanding its platform. To date, Fleek says it has worked with some 10,000 resellers and retailers from 70 countries, moving 2.5 million items of secondhand clothes from 1,000 wholesale suppliers.
The investment comes from an impressive list of backers: HV Capital is leading the round, while Andreessen Horowitz (which led the startup’s seed round) and accelerator Y Combinator (where Fleek was a part of the Winter 2022 batch) are participating. Individual backers in the round include Shopify president Harley Finkelstein, Depop’s ex-CEO Maria Raga, and Postmates’ CTO Sean Plaice.
Fleek was founded by friends Abhi Arora and Sanket Agarwal following a very direct grievance from a future in-law.
It was 2021, and the mother of Agarwal’s then-girlfriend, who sold clothes on secondhand social commerce site Poshmark (now owned by Naver), was talking about sourcing problems due to supply chain issues at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Separately, Arora, fresh out of an MBA at Cambridge, was living close to Brick Lane in London, a major destination for secondhand clothes buyers, and he went over there to investigate what things were like.
He got to chatting with a vintage clothes shop manager. Used-clothing wholesalers, the manager told him, serve as funnels for sourcing clothing, providing many secondhand stores with stock. These wholesalers were offline, so the retailers tended to travel to source goods from the wholesalers in person, picking through racks, going “heads down, bums up,” in the words of Arora, Fleek’s CEO.
That practice became impossible with travel restrictions, yet what this retailer had noticed was that a handful of the wholesalers had started showing off their goods on Instagram, and they were negotiating ad hoc over video calls.
That gave Arora and Agarwal, a software engineer who previously worked at Google, their inspiration. They would build a marketplace to make it easier for any wholesaler to sell online, and for any retailer to buy that way. Make the experience consistent for everyone on both sides of the table and take a cut on the payment for providing the service.
Fleek’s commission, Agarwal said, depends on the amount and quality of goods being sold: its cut comes out of the payments that buyers are paying to the wholesalers.
And then, as they started to look into who these offline wholesalers actually were, it felt like fate.
“It turned out that the sub-continent is one of the biggest exporters and importers of used clothes,” Arora said. “Sanket and I both grew up in India. We speak the language. That really helped us connect with these wholesalers.”
It wasn’t that long ago that secondhand clothing was mainly the domain of lower-income consumers: Charity shops and donation points were mainstays for collecting those items and redistributing them to those who needed them near and far… sometimes very far. The whole process of intake and selling was quite analog.
Over the years, the concept has had a major makeover, particularly in more developed economies, where secondhand clothing — sometimes loftily referred to as “vintage” — has come into its own. Besides those who can’t spend a lot or just want to save money, there are shoppers who can afford to buy new clothes, but they opt for secondhand to assert their individuality in a sea of mass-market goods. Or they are buying used to tap into the circular economy and virtuously reduce waste.
For those of us on the lookout for a diamond-in-the-rough bargain, prices may not be much different than new, and in many cases, much higher. And the number of places selling used clothes has ballooned. Charity shops now compete with more curated secondhand stores, and even major chains like Urban Outfitters and high-end high-street boutiques are leaning into the vintage vibe.
Alongside this has been a boom of online sellers across eBay, Vinted, Poshmark, ThredUp, The RealReal, Depop, Instagram, TikTok, and many more. Used clothing now makes up 10% of all clothing sales, according to a survey from GlobalData and ThredUp.
The ECDB, a specialist e-commerce data analytics firm, estimates that 68% of all Gen Z and millennial consumers in the U.K. (a big market for vintage) bought at least one secondhand item in the last year.
Fleek has customers all around the world buying goods from its sellers, but according to Arora, the biggest suppliers are not individuals who donate their clothes to charity, but wholesalers, who in this case are very large warehouses that are the ultimate collectors and distributors of those items.
The wholesalers that Fleek tends to work with are in countries like Pakistan, India, and Dubai, and they serve both the developing world (still major customers for secondhand clothes) and the developed world (where someone with a bigger wallet might pay as much or possibly more for a great pair of used Levi’s over a new pair).
When I spoke to Arora and Agarwal the other day, they were respectively in Pakistan and India visiting suppliers, and they said that typically these wholesalers can handle — take in, sort, mend, clean up, and send out — up to 400,000 kilograms of clothing in a single day. That sounds chaotic, but that’s what makes Fleek so interesting: Go to the site and you’ll see extreme organization, where those hundreds of thousands of kilos can be bought by weight, or by brand, style, size, material, and more.
As well as doing the hard work of bringing massive, physical businesses online for the first time, Fleek is also spinning up technology for those further along that journey.
It already offers predictive analytics to customers to help them forecast different trends. (Surely this has to be programmed to just tell buyers to seek things popular 20 and 40 years previously.) You could imagine more AI tooling to help with quality control and to better safeguard against counterfeiting, something the two admit is a huge problem in the industry that they want to help stop.
Another area it will likely develop more functionality is in speeding up logistics around buying, shipping, and receiving, especially around wholesalers who are being positively reviewed by buyers, said Agarwal.
“We want to bring on more buyers, bring on more sellers, and build technology to continue empowering these entrepreneurs on both sides of the marketplace,” he said."

The company said on Tuesday that Misra, who helped steer the $100 billion Vision Fund through both its explosive rise and subsequent challenges, will relinquish his positions as co-head of SoftBank Investment Advisers and SoftBank Global Advisers. Alex Clavel will assume sole leadership as chief executive of both units.
The move comes after Misra withdrew from his executive positions at SoftBank Group in August 2022, when he stepped back from his roles as corporate officer and executive vice president of the parent company. The former Deutsche Bank executive launched One Investment Management, a $6.8 billion fund backed by Abu Dhabi, in 2022.
Misra will no longer have an official role at SoftBank, the company said.
During his ten-year tenure at SoftBank, Misra’s Vision Fund also became known for several troubled investments including WeWork, dog-walking app Wag and Greensill Capital, while he also clashed with senior colleagues including Nikesh Arora and Marcelo Claure, both of whom eventually left the firm."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/quantune-joins-quest-for-the-holy-grail-of-non-invasive-glucose-monitoring/,Quantune joins quest for the holy grail of non-invasive glucose monitoring | TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,2024-11-12,"Numerous companies have tried and failed to develop a device that can measure blood sugar levels without pricking the skin for a blood sample. Even Alphabet had a go at it with contact lenses for diabetic patients, but abandoned the project in 2018.
Still, the quest for non-invasive glucose monitoring continues to captivate scientists and investors. A slew of startups and several large companies, including Apple, are working on various approaches to solving the puzzle.
Berlin-based Quantune Technologies may have made some progress: Its founders, Dr. Jan Kischkat (pictured above at the far right) and Nikolaus Hahne (pictured above, second from right), said they have succeeded in reducing the size of an infrared laser spectrometer to a much smaller size. Laser spectrometers are normally bulky devices that can measure glucose and other molecules non-invasively in interstitial fluid, which nourishes all the cells and is present right below the skin, Kischkat explained.
The company’s goal is to embed its technology in a wrist-worn device that can be used by anyone, not just diabetics, since continuous blood glucose monitoring has many applications in sports and weight management.
But first, Quantune needs to get two things right: shrink its device further and get it to work outside the lab.
“[This technology] works beautifully in a lab. In the lab, everything is super stable. You can stabilize the temperature. You can stabilize the pressure when you push your arm against the sensor,” Kischkat said. “When you’re going out and taking this thing jogging, everything vibrates, everything moves around. You need a stable reference point for every measurement.”
To bolster its R&D, the company just raised €8.5 million ($9.05 million) in seed funding from Point72 Ventures (a firm founded by prominent hedge fund manager Steven Cohen) and Munich-based Vsquared Ventures.
The company expects this R&D process to take about two years, but given that even deep-pocketed Apple has been hacking away at its non-invasive glucose monitoring research for reportedly 12 years now, Quantune’s timeline may be ambitious.
Kischkat and Hahne told TechCrunch that the seed funding will also go towards hiring additional staff. The company was previously awarded €5 million ($5.3 million) in public grants awarded by the European Innovation Council (EIC) and the Investment Bank of Berlin (IBB)
Other startups trying to crack the code on needle-free blood sugar monitoring include Synex Medical, which in September raised $22 million, and HME Square, which uses photoacoustics, a technique that combines the principles of optics and acoustics to image biological tissues (such as blood).
In 2021, GraphWear raised a $20.5 million Series B for developing technology that can fit into a watch. The company hasn’t provided any public updates on its scientific progress since then.
In recent years, the FDA has approved several continuous glucose monitoring devices, including the FreeStyle Libre in 2017. While these devices offer significant benefits, they still require a small, needle-like sensor inserted under the skin to measure glucose levels."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/agicap-secures-48-million-for-its-cash-flow-management-platform/,Agicap secures $48 million for its cash flow management platform | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-11-12,"On average, Agicap’s clients manage 15 different bank accounts each. So the chief financial officers (CFOs) working for these companies sometimes struggle to make sure that there will be enough money in the right bank account to pay employees and suppliers across different subsidiaries, countries and currencies.
That’s also why they turn to Agicap to centralize cash-related data and forecast future cash positions. The Lyon-based startup just raised a Series C funding round of €45 million (around $48 million at current exchange rates) from a single investor, AVP, the VC firm previously known as Axa Venture Partners.
The fintech startup previously raised $100 million, back in 2021, right in the middle of the digital funding frenzy around the pandemic. At the time, the company reached a valuation of €415 million (or around $450 million at current exchange rates). The value of the business has since inflated “substantially”, per Agicap, though it isn’t disclosing by how much.
“We aren’t disclosing the exact valuation, but we have managed to increase it substantially since 2021,” co-founder and CEO Sébastien Beyet (pictured above) told TechCrunch. Pressed on this he gave us a hint of the new valuation: Les Échos previously reported that Agicap was raising at a valuation between €700 million and €800 million (or $750 million to $860 million) — and Beyet said: “We’re sticking with this range.”
Agicap’s relative success comes down to a narrow focus on treasury management software — it isn’t trying to do everything at once like most fintech startups.
It’s also a relatively untapped market as many companies still rely on Excel and file exports from bank accounts and ERP software. Evidence of this lies in a recent study Agicap did with 500 European CFOs of midmarket companies. When asked about the tool of choice to manage and forecast their cash positions, 80% of them answered Excel.
It’s also worth noting that Agicap’s main customers are CFOs and financial departments. And when teams in charge of money like a product they’re not going to unsubscribe anytime soon.
Agicap customers can sync data from their existing bank accounts, credit institutions and ERP solutions. It then acts as a central repository to view everything related to past and future cash flows. But Agicap isn’t just a visualization dashboard; users can initiate and schedule transfers directly from its interface, too.
“We think that we’ll be able to use cash management as the basis for what we call the CFO suite, and provide other tools to CFOs and treasurers,” Beyet said.
In that vein, more recently, the startup added accounts payable and accounts receivable. These features help you get paid faster as you can see pending invoices and nudge customers in case they’re late. Similarly, Agicap imports purchase orders so that you can pay suppliers on time and use that data for your upcoming budgets.
The startup currently has 8,000 customers with around half of them in France. Most of its remaining customers are spread across other European countries. “We focus on mid-sized companies, with an annual revenue of €5 million to €10 million on average — and up to €500 million,” Beyet said.
“We’ve already reached a break-even position on a cash basis for this quarter. So we didn’t need to raise any additional funds to continue our development. But we believe our market is huge,” he added.
In addition to hiring new people to find new customers, Agicap plans to use the funding to launch new features around credit management and foreign exchange risk management.
What about offering credit products directly? “We don’t want to become a bank,” said Beyet. “In other words, we don’t want to take on the financial risk of lending money ourselves. We know how to make software, and that’s what we intend to focus on.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/ecosia-and-qwant-two-european-search-engines-join-forces-on-building-an-index-to-shrink-reliance-on-big-tech/,"Ecosia and Qwant, two European search engines, join forces on an index to shrink reliance on Big Tech | TechCrunch","Natasha Lomas, Ivan Mehta",2024-11-12,"Qwant, France’s privacy-focused search engine, and Ecosia, a Berlin-based not-for-profit search engine that uses ad revenue to fund tree planting and other climate-focused initiatives, are joining forces on a joint venture to develop their own European search index.
The pair hopes this move will help drive innovation in their respective search engines — including and especially around generative AI — as well as reducing dependence on search indexes provided by tech giants Microsoft (Bing) and Google. Both currently rely on Bing’s search APIs while Ecosia also uses Google’s search results.
Rising API costs are one clear motivator for the move to shrink this Big Tech dependency, with Microsoft massively hiking prices for Bing’s search APIs last year.
Neither Ecosia nor Qwant will stop using Bing or Google altogether. However, they aim to diversify the core tech supporting their services with their own index. It will lower their operational costs, and serve as a technical base to fuel their own product development as GenAI technologies take up a more central role in many consumer-facing digital services.
Both search engines have already dabbled in integrating GenAI features. Expect more on this front, although they aren’t planning to develop AI model development themselves. They say they will continue to rely on API access to major platforms’ large language models (LLMs) to power these additions.
The pair is also open to other European firms joining in with their push for more tech stack sovereignty — at least as fellow customers for the search index, as they plan to license access via an API. Other forms of partnership could be considered too, they told TechCrunch.
“The door is open and we are ready to talk to anyone,” said Qwant CEO Olivier Abecassis. “But we also want to focus and really secure the capacity to invest with our existing shareholders.”
“We know that we will fuel the company for the next years, and we know that our shareholders are ready to support it, and really expect us to move fast,” he added. “We will discuss with investors to speed up the developments and to do more — and with others to join in the partnership. So the plan is really to move as fast as possible.”
AI is driving a dual sense of urgency for both parties, as it rapidly creates a landscape of new opportunities and potential pitfalls.
“With the emergence of AI tools there is a different demand now for a search index,” Ecosia CEO Christian Kroll suggested. “The two providers, Bing and Google, are basically getting more reluctant to make their index accessible. And of course, as a search engine, we need an index. So that’s partially why we want to make sure we have access.”
“But also there is now a unique moment where you can use that type of index to build a very different experience — using generative AI to create a different experience — and we don’t want to be restricted in using that technology.”
Kroll also pointed to a regulatory environment in Europe that is keen to foster homegrown tech innovation in order to bolster the bloc’s strategic autonomy as another reason for making a bet on a homebrew search index now.
“The opportunity just has gotten a lot better,” he said. “With the [EU’s] Digital Markets Act, for the first time, ‘click and query data,’ for example, is going to be shared by other search engines — so we have access to that. Also access to platforms is different than it used to be. So we’ve been thinking about this for a long time, but now it’s the right moment to actually do it.”
“We believe that if we want to get a meaningful GenAI user experience, we need access to LLM models,” added Abecassis. “But we also need access to search tech.”
The combination of GenAI models with up-to-date information pulled in through search queries will be key to advancing search product utility, he argued.
“We believe that the combination of the two will be the next user experience for search,” he said. “Search and GenAI are not exactly the same. We believe that both will take benefit from the other, and the mix will be unique.”
“Google decided to have two strong products, but not mix them. And I can understand when I look at the legacy business model of Google. But in the future, something will happen between [these technologies] and that’s what we want to experience. And for that, any player on the market will need access to a search technology. That’s why we want to propose [this] to the market.”
The pair’s new joint venture, which is being called European Search Perspective, is being set up with a 50:50 ownership split. (Note: EUP is their chosen acronym, rather than ESP.)
Ecosia and Qwant are not disclosing how much they’re each investing but said their shareholders are supportive. Plus, as a separate entity, EUP will sit outside the former’s not-for-profit business model — allowing it to raise external capital (assuming investors can be persuaded to get on board).
The index is expected to start serving France-based search engine traffic for Ecosia and Qwant by the first quarter of next year. It will then expand to include a “significant portion” of traffic in Germany by the end of 2025.
English would be the third language they’d look to add, the pair said, adding that more European languages could follow in the future if momentum builds.
On the operational side, Qwant’s engineering team will be moving to EUP, while Abecassis — who took on the CEO role at the search engine just over a year ago — will be CEO of the joint venture, too.
Qwant was acquired by a cloud technology group called Synfonium last year, which is backed by the founders of French cloud computing firm OVHcloud, with a goal of building a “European champion” for cloud services.
Discussing the plan for EUP in a call with TechCrunch, Abecassis explained Qwant had been working on developing its own search index even before it was acquired by Synfondium. Those efforts will now move over to EUP, he confirmed, with both team and IP assets transferring over.
Joining forces with Ecosia bolsters the chance of success, he suggested, as it expands the pool of data available for developing the index, as well as increasing investment in the project and enabling faster development, such as by being able to hire more engineers.
Ecosia has around 20 million monthly users globally, while Qwant has some 6 million users in France.
“If we want to be really efficient, we have to involve more people… and be more ambitious,” said Abecassis, recounting how Qwant approached Ecosia to ask it to consider a partnership on developing the search index.
“For Qwant, it’s a major opportunity to build better tech — because search technologies are good if they are used… So the more tech is used, the more money you can invest, but also the more data you get. One of the reasons why Google is so strong is it’s based on tons of data.”
The two firms share a few characteristics that make a partnership look like a good cultural fit, with both search alternatives being developed in Europe and having business models that seek to do something different compared to Big Tech’s standard surveillance capitalism playbook. EUP, meanwhile, will be headquartered in Paris.
“Building such a technology from scratch is almost impossible,” added Abecassis. “The more user[s] we have and the more data sets we have will make the technology more valuable.”
Kroll said Ecosia is bringing expertise, data and financing to the partnership — noting that as well as developing the search engine there will be other technologies that EUP will need to develop, such as widgets that can be served as part of search results.
The pair expects the partnership to boost the efficiency of search results they can deliver their respective users, as EUP hones its ranking algorithms — even as each search engine will continue to develop its own distinctive user experience.
Rival search engine Brave, which much like Qwant has a sales pitch that foregrounds privacy, has already built its own search index. It even removed the last API calls for text-based searches to Bing in April last year when it touted its service as a “real alternative to Big Tech search.”
Asked about this, Abecassis suggested Brave’s index cleaves closer to Google and Bing in the technical approach. Whereas he emphasized that EUP is being built from scratch, claiming it will be “very different” and will deliver more diverse search results.
“We don’t just copy Google or Microsoft and learn from them,” he stressed. “We really index all the documents that are available. We understand the documents, and then we have a team that works to find the best match between a document and the [search] query.”
“So it is true that there are probably some shortcuts to build such a tech by copying the main guys. We decided to go in a different direction and build everything from scratch. It’s harder but, we believe, it’s more sustainable.”
One big difference compared to Big Tech search is that EUP’s search index will serve up “privacy-first” results. What does that mean in practice? Abecassis said this is a result of tech developed by Qwant that does not personalize search results based on the user (as Google does).
“We’re going to continue to work without any [user] data [personalizing results],” he said. “Then we will improve our algorithm based on the data that are available.”
“I think it’s a big win — big privacy win,” added Kroll of the choice of technical approach. But he also emphasized the strategic value of having search infrastructure that’s made in Europe at a time of increasing geopolitical instability.
“From a European perspective… what does [search infrastructure reliance] mean for the dependency of the European Union? Especially considering [the U.S] election results… If the U.S. government decided that they would not want to provide search results to Europeans anymore, we in Europe would have to go back to phone books.”
“There is a privacy element, but then there’s also an element of data sovereignty, which I think is very important,” he added. “I of course hope that the U.S. and Europe will always stay strong allies. But I don’t know where the U.S. is heading, and I also don’t know where Europe is heading. So this is a very important element.”
TechCrunch asked Brave about its own decision to build a search index. It told us that prior to switching to its own tech it “always risked Microsoft imposing restrictions on us or simply cutting us off” — so the move was intended to free the business from a risky dependency.
“According to our quality assessment team, which does blinded assessments for quality of results, we are on par with Google and better than Bing in the countries we measure (those in which Brave Search is the default for Brave browser users),” the company also told us, adding that Brave Search is “the fastest growing search engine since Bing” with over 1 billion queries per month.
Discussing the costs of developing the index, Brave described the process as “long and very expensive” — pointing back to its 2021 acquisition of the open source Tailcat search engine, a technology whose development it said dates back to 2014.
“There is a reason why there are only three fully-fledged independent search indexes in the West,” Brave added.
The company licenses its search index via the Brave Search API. The API is being used by “many leading companies in the AI space,” per Brave, which added that it’s quickly becoming a “significant” source of revenue.
TechCrunch also asked search engineer Peter Popov about the costs involved in building a search index. Popov spent 15 years at Russian search giant Yandex, working on core search and ranking, and is now VP of ads at VK.
“Very roughly, a search index, which includes hardware and the cost of writing a search, does not cost much more than $10 million,” Popov told us, couching such an outlay as “not a very large investment.” He suggested that advances in AI have made it easier to produce quality search results without needing vast amounts of users feeding in data,”by using modern LLM models that contain knowledge of search semantics out of the box.”At the same time, he warned there is growing challenge over where search bots can — or can’t — freely crawl. This is a problem as a search index needs wide access to information sources in order to usefully serve users’ queries.
“Proprietary platforms are often quite unfriendly to attempts to collect information,” Popov told TechCrunch.
“Creating a search index for the entire Internet is not such a difficult task from a technical point of view. The volume of useful information on the internet grows more slowly than computing power. By the way, one of the problems for scaling AI is precisely the relatively small volume of such information.”
“The useful-for-information-search internet is not that big,” he continued. “There is no internet of sites to search right now. And wait, of these [mainstream web] platforms, only Wikipedia is open to search. So that leaves Wikipedia search.“After Wikipedia there are not many useful sites like arxiv.org or large online libraries. Information of this kind can be used in two ways — either by providing data during network training, or by feeding the neural network with search results during inference, in which case the search is one of the components of LLM working under the hood.”
In other words, in order for a search index to be useful, it also needs to be able to freely crawl the internet. But with Big Tech more jealously guarding info inside its own platforms these days, as giants compete to monetize user data afresh for training LLMs, this is also complicating the business of trying to get out from under their shadow by indexing the internet for search… From a rock to a hard place, then."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/as-demand-for-lithium-explodes-battery-recycling-startup-tozero-sprints-to-scale-with-11-7m-seed/,"As demand for lithium explodes, battery recycling startup Tozero sprints to scale with $11.7M seed | TechCrunch",Natasha Lomas,2024-11-12,"Tozero, a Munich-based startup that recovers valuable raw materials from recycled lithium-ion batteries, is gearing up to scale. The startup just closed an oversubscribed €11 million seed round (around $11.7M) to step up production by building its first industrial deployment (A.K.A first-of-a-kind or FOAK) plant.
Currently, Tozero’s pilot plant processes nine tonnes of lithium-ion battery waste per day, but the startup is shooting for unlimited capacity in what it hopes will be just another couple of years of scaling its business.
“Other competitors raise way more money to get to industrial plant. But as our process and our technology is so lean and efficient we don’t require more to get to our first industrial deployment, or what the investor world would call the ‘first of a kind’ plant. That’s what we’re aiming to build,” co-founder and CEO Sarah Fleischer (pictured above, left) told TechCrunch.
Once Tozero’s process hits industrial pace and functionality, the startup says there will be no hard limits on what it can achieve in battery recycling as long as it can keep accessing waste streams.
“The purpose of the FOAK is really to enter the proper continuous production — manufacturing — of the product,” co-founder and managing director, Dr. Ksenija Milicevic Neumann, added.
“After that, it’s unlimited, infinite, exponential growth possible,” Fleischer claimed. “Our idea is to operate the plants ourselves worldwide. We focus on Germany, on Europe, and then we go to North America. But after we reach that [FOAK] plant, we can expand Tozero on multiple dimensions around the world. So that’s going to be a key milestone for the next growth phase.”
The startup pointed to projections that global demand for lithium is expected to quadruple to 3.1 million metric tons by 2030, driven by rapid uptake of electric vehicles and growing need for large-scale renewable energy batteries. For context, lithium mining production yielded only 180,000 metric tons last year, so recycling will have a critical role to play in servicing that demand.
The EU’s Battery Directive will also make it mandatory that at least 80% of lithium must be recovered from batteries by 2031.
“The technology works… So the core part of our technology is already nailed. Now we just have to industrialize it,” Fleischer said.
The startup is tackling bottlenecks in lithium battery recycling using a water-based carbonation recovery process that’s more environmentally friendly than conventional pyrometallurgy (smelting). Its method of reclaiming lithium also doesn’t entail the use of harsh acids, as can be the case with other battery recycling processes.
Tozero says its method also results in substantially lower emissions — 70% lower — than mining.
“The security of the raw material — it’s national security in a way,” Fleischer said. “There are so many underserved industries here in Europe that are starving for the material because Europe doesn’t produce lithium carbonate; we’re importing. If you look at [European Commission president] Ursula von der Leyen, she makes statements that we import over 97% of the lithium carbonate from China. So we’re highly dependent on the eastern front and mining industries.”
Access to black mass, the byproduct of mechanical recycling of lithium batteries that Tozero processes, is not restricted across borders. And on the competition front, Fleischer describes this as a “completely blue ocean market,” with battery recycling efforts mostly focused elsewhere. The startup says it can use black mass from any type of lithium-ion batteries so the waste streams can be mixed.
“Lithium will be always inside [the batteries for recycling], but the other elements are changing — with innovations in battery manufacturing — so we don’t care if there is nickel, or if it’s a few percent less or more, for example, cobalt, but lithium is always there,” said Milicevic Neumann.
Tozero also reclaims graphite from the black mass waste streams. The startup says its focus on these two critical raw materials is a “key differentiation” versus other battery recycling players.
The focus on lithium is also why the startup has customers beating a path to its door.
“Customers are just storming this place,” Fleischer said, couching market demand as “way too high” for many industrial use-cases in Europe. Tozero has lined up customers worth “over a billion of off-take that are keen to have our material,” she said.
Tozero delivered its first batch of recycled high-purity lithium to commercial customers this April, nine months after opening its pilot facility in Germany.
Tozero was only founded in 2022, so how has it achieved something larger players in the space evidently haven’t managed over the past couple of decades? The startup says it boils down to having a tight focus, being fast and thinking creatively.
Being fast requires being creative when you’re building hardware, Fleischer argued, explaining that the biggest challenge for hardware startups is the issue of delivery times for getting the equipment needed to scale.
“We break things fast, learn, iterate and improve at a very fast pace — probably like Elon Musk’s SpaceX kind of principle — just get stuff building and see [what happens] until things break, learn from it, and iterate and improve in very fast sprints, which is very unfamiliar for hardware companies,” said Fleischer.
“I would say we protect ourselves with speed,” she added, confirming that Tozero’s approach is based on a “process innovation” that’s protected as a trade secret, though it’s not patented. “The entire process, steps or parameters, the order, how we do specific things, that is completely our ‘Coca Cola’ [trade secret] recipe,” she added.
Tozero believes it can expand its approach to reclaim other raw materials that could be used as “energy sources,” though it wouldn’t specify which materials it may add later.
The overarching mission is to get to zero waste of critical raw materials. “We’re quite aware of [the broader challenges entailed in decarbonizing in a sustainable way],” Milicevic Neumann told TechCrunch. “So we want also to focus on recycling of some other materials in the future as well.”
But if it wants to achieve real impact, wouldn’t Tozero have to license its trade secrets to others? The pair say they haven’t fully decided their approach, but prefer to retain control over the process as they scale — though they are open to partnerships.
“On the operational side, we believe we can only really deliver the highest quality if we operate the plants ourselves,” said Fleischer. “This can be also with partners. I mean, we’re open for that. So I don’t want to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to licensing. Partnerships are great to scale, if helpful, but we’re going to operate our plants ourselves.”
Tozero’s seed round was led by NordicNinja, with participation from new investors In-Q-Tel (the U.S. strategic public-private fund), Honda, and global infrastructure engineering giant JGC Group. The startup’s €3.5 million pre-seed round, closed around two years ago, was led by Berlin-based Atlantic Labs. To date, Tozero has raised €17 million, which includes a €2.5 million grant from the EU’s R&D support arm, the European Innovation Council.
“Tozero’s innovative approach to battery recycling is exactly what Europe needs to secure key supplies in the global electrification race and Japan would love to collaborate,” said Shin Nikkuni, co-founder and managing partner at NordicNinja, in a statement. “Sarah and Ksenija, two exceptional founders, have the expertise and drive to transform the landscape for sustainable battery solutions. We’re excited to support the tozero team in scaling its technology and commercial operation and contributing to a more sustainable and independent energy future for all.”

In 2023, cashless transactions in Japan totaled 126.7 trillion yen ($885 billion), accounting for 39.3 percent of all spending in the country, said the Japanese government. The government hopes that number reaches 40 percent by 2025.
The Japanese government’s initiative to increase cashless transactions is being supported by a Tokyo-based startup called SmartBank, which offers an app and services that make switching to cashless payments easier for people.
Shota Horii (CEO of SmartBank), along with his twin brother Yuta Horii (CTO) and Jun Taketani (CXO), founded the company in 2019 after selling their previous company, Fablic, to Rakuten in 2016. While running Fablic, the three discovered that many users were still using cash for everyday financial transactions. The founders launched SmartBank in an effort to address a problem within the consumer finance industry in Japan.
SmartBank’s primary target users are individuals in their 20s and 30s seeking to manage personal finances, as well as married couples looking to manage their finances. Now the company says it has more than 1 million downloads, but they did not provide the number of users.
Its core product is a prepaid card and a finance management app that offers a deposit account. Its prepaid cards include the B/43 My Card, the Visa-branded payment card for single individuals; the B/43 Pair Card for users to manage their finances with their partners; and the B/43 Junior Card for teens.
“Our core user base,[which was B/43 My Card], is now the B/43 Pair Card users…this is significant as banks in Japan do not provide joint bank accounts, and B/43 has become the go-to product,” Shimogawara said.
The startup said Tuesday that it has raised 4 billion JPY ($26 million), with 1.1 billion JPY ($7.2 million) coming from debt financing and 2.9 billion JPY ($18.8 million) from equity provided by its current investor, Global Brain. The equity capital is from a fund formed with SMBC, one of the largest banks in Japan. As of April 2024, SmartBank had raised a total of 5.93 billion JPY ($38.5M) in equity and 1.1 billion JPY in debt since its inception. The startup will use the new capital to double down on hiring from 49 staff in October to around 100 employees by 2025; half of the total workforce will be the engineering team, SmartBank CFO Yuta Shimogawara said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.
The latest funding comes roughly two and a half years after its Series A, $20M, in July 2022. The startup has since then expanded its user base and product offerings with the goal of becoming a comprehensive financial platform like a bank, providing a wide range of financial services to users in the future.
Just last month, the company introduced an AI receipt reading feature by using generative AI technology to transform its app into an AI-driven financial advisor, said Chihaya Akaike, the director of business operations at SmartBank. This feature helps users better understand their finances, optimizes and automates financial activities, and enables them to use, save, and invest their money, Akaike told TechCrunch.
“Consumer fintech services in Japan have been slow to use AI, but our goal is to become the leading AI fintech company in the country,” Akaike continued.
On top of that, the company recently added a feature allowing users to connect their credit cards and bank accounts to B/43 to get a holistic view of their finances. “We will be making our service accessible to non-card users as we open it so that users can start using B/43 without issuing a card and by simply linking their existing credit cards and bank accounts, which will also expand our revenue stream,” Akaike explained.
SmartBank obtained a license for money transfers three years ago, allowing users to withdraw their deposits in cash. It also received a prepaid payment instrument license in April, enabling the startup to hold users’ deposits. The licenses help the company offer services like payments and P2P transfers.
Its peers like MoneyForward and Zaim cannot hold users’ deposits, which limits their ability to assist users in managing their personal assets, such as savings and investments, according to the company.
The five-year-old outfit plans to diversify revenue streams beyond its interchange fees (IRF), where most revenue comes from. In addition to IRF, it has implemented other services like Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), subscription (B/43 Plus), and referrals, Akaike said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/indonesian-vc-firm-intudo-closes-125m-across-two-investment-funds/,Indonesian VC firm Intudo raises $125M across two funds | TechCrunch,Kate Park,2024-11-12,"Intudo, the Indonesia-only venture capital firm, said it has raised $125 million across two investment funds — $75 million for Intudo Ventures IV, and $50 million for another fund that will invest in downstream natural resources and renewable energy.
Intudo said Fund IV will invest in Indonesian startups that take advantage of the country’s location, digital advancements, and expanding middle-class population — essentially those playing to the country’s strengths in consumer products, aquaculture and horticulture, as well as commercial distribution, regulatory, and deep tech startups. The other fund will be its first attempt to leverage Indonesia’s strong position in the global nickel and cobalt market to invest in natural resources and renewable energy.
Identifying areas where Indonesia is competitive is essential for the country on a global scale, founding partner of Intudo, Eddy Chan, told TechCrunch.
“In Taiwan, it’s semiconductors going to the world. In Japan, electronics used to be prevalent. In Israel, it’s cybersecurity. SaaS in India. South Korea has K-pop. In Indonesia, we need to find more gold in aquaculture shrimp [farming],” Chan said.
Intudo typically writes checks between $1 million and $10 million, and is targeting a portfolio of 14-18 Indonesian companies, aiming to buy large stakes in each via Intudo Ventures IV, Chan said. He explained that in a typical Series A round, the firm will invest $3 million to $5 million for stakes of 20% to 30%.
“I think winning in Southeast Asia [requires] a small fund size and significant ownership… In contrast, the market is currently dominated by many peers with $200 million or $300 million funds, but with ownership targets of only 10% to 15%,” he said.
“Many of the funds in the market are Indonesia-focused, but we make the distinction that we’re Indonesia only. 100% of our fund’s investment is in Indonesia,” said Patrick Yip, a founding partner at Intudo.
The firm is finalizing a number of deals that it will disclose in the coming months, Yip added.
Intudo said it caps each limited partner’s investment at 10% of the total fund size to ensure equitable treatment for all LPs and maintain its independent investment thesis.
The new fund comes three years after the firm closed its third fund at $115 million. The firm seems to have broadened its LP base since then, receiving investments from institutions and family offices from the United States, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, including Netherlands-based Orient Growth Ventures and Singapore-based Black Kite Capital. More than 20 global funds and managing partners, 15 billionaires listed in Forbes and their related businesses, and over 30 influential families in Indonesia also invested, the firm said.
“Eighty percent of our deals are followed by our global LP base from Korea, Silicon Valley, Europe, the Middle East,” Chan said.
Before founding Intudo in 2017, Yip worked for a private equity firm, while Eddy Chan was a lawyer and ran his own startup. The firm has a team of 12 and more than $350 million in assets under management.
Out of the new natural resources fund, Intudo has invested in CarbonEthics, an Indonesia-based developer of tech-enabled natural climate solutions."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/lightspeed-doubles-down-on-wheelocity-as-it-pivots-to-rural-india-commerce/,Lightspeed doubles down on Wheelocity as it pivots to rural India commerce | TechCrunch,Jagmeet Singh,2024-11-11,"While India’s urban population is shifting from mom-and-pop stores to quick commerce platforms, its rural side — home to more than 800 million people — still heavily relies on offline businesses for daily consumption. Wheelocity aims to transform that untapped market to let people living beyond the top 200 cities of the country easily shop online.
The Chennai-headquartered startup, founded in September 2021, has pivoted from the earlier B2B supply chain business for quick commerce platforms into building a platform to solve e-commerce access for people living in semi-urban. and rural areas, commonly referred to as “Bharat.”
For a long time, e-commerce giants Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart have tried to tap rural India to get deeper into the world’s second-biggest internet market after China. The region has also attracted startups including Meesho and Rozana. However, Wheelocity founder and CEO Selvam VMS told TechCrunch that none of them could crack that space due to the access problem.
“Our approach to solving this problem is extremely unique,” he said in an interview. “We are focused on building a 100x better alternative for our consumers.”
Wheelocity has begun the shift by providing freshly produced goods including vegetables and fruits and groceries through its app. However, unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that sell products online, the startup has taken a “phygital” approach. This includes electric three-wheelers to let the startup take its products into villages physically daily to help gain the trust of consumers. These vehicles let consumers place orders using Wheelocity’s app and get deliveries on their doorstep.
Once they get used to it, consumers will start using the Wheelocity app at home, VMS predicted.
The executive added that, unlike Wheelocity, which offers doorstep deliveries daily, other e-commerce platforms use their take as long as a week to get products delivered in the same region. This makes it a challenge to deliver fresh consumable items and groceries.
Wheelocity uses its existing supply chain, built for the earlier B2B business, to offer customers freshly produced goods and groceries faster. After procuring them from third parties including farmers, the products reach consumers with Wheelocity’s branding.
VMS sees the shift, which silently started in October 2023, as a $1 trillion-plus opportunity. He didn’t disclose the business-related figures but said the startup had a “very, very good retention.”
The startup currently offers its e-commerce platform in 3,500 villages in central Tamil Nadu and owns 1,000 electric vehicles to allow physical order-placing and deliveries. It has already established an operations office in Tamil Nadu’s tier-II city of Trichy to understand consumers’ buying behavior better and get their feedback. Next, it plans to scale the business to 20,000 towns and villages and expand it to all five southern states of India within the next 12 months, taking its platform to 10 million consumers.
Lightspeed, Wheelocity’s existing investor, has backed the latest move by leading its Series A2 round of $15 million. In July 2022, the VC fund had led the startup’s $12 million Series A round.
Alteria Capital, Anicut Capital, and VMS also participated in Wheelocity’s fresh round. Further, the round includes an undisclosed amount of debt, primarily to fuel the financing of its electric fleet.
Lightspeed partner Rahul Taneja told TechCrunch that the VC fund decided to reinvest into Wheelocity as the market size was significantly large and untapped and the startup created a unique business model, “which allows profitable coverage of the areas which were historically not possible.”
The founder’s quality and passion for building a “profit-making business” before pivoting also helped convince Lightspeed to close the deal, Taneja said.
Moving focus to smaller towns and villages in India has been an emerging trend in the VC market, as consumers in those areas often have disposable income and intent to buy. Earlier this year, Accel also started looking at the region to hunt for future unicorns."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/apple-may-update-find-my-app-to-let-you-share-locations-of-lost-items/,Apple updates Find My to let you share locations of lost items | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-11,"Apple will soon let users share the location of lost or missing items — such as an iPhone, MacBook, or something with an AirTag attached — via the Find My app with people who are not in their contacts using a link.
The company is currently testing this feature on the iOS 18.2 public beta after introducing it with the 18.2 developer beta earlier this month. Apple said the feature is intended to help locate your lost items by sharing their location with third-parties such as a cab driver or an airline employee.
The company said in the coming months, nearly 20 airlines will start accepting Find My item location links as part of their customer services for lost luggage. These airlines include Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eurowings, Iberia, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines, Turkish Airlines, United, Virgin Atlantic, and Vueling. Airline staff will have to authenticate access through their Apple account or partner email address.
The Find My app will feature a new “Share Item Location” option, which gives you a shareable link to the location of the missing item. People can open the link on any device (including non-Apple devices) to try and track it. The link automatically expires after a week or when the item is back with you.
There’s also a “Share Contact Info” option that lets any phone connect with an item and open a website, which will show your phone number and email — if you’ve added those details to the item’s contact page. Seemingly, this is meant to help the person who finds the item contact you.
“The Find My network and AirTag have proven to be a powerful combination for users while traveling, providing invaluable location information when bags have been misplaced or mishandled. With Share Item Location, we’re excited to give users a new way to easily share this information directly with third parties like airlines, all while protecting their privacy,” Eddie Cue, Apple’s SVP of services, said in a statement.
Find My already lets you share an item’s location with people in your contacts. The update would also let users look at statistics like how many people visited the link."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/amazon-confirms-employee-data-stolen-after-hacker-claims-moveit-breach/,Amazon confirms employee data stolen after hacker claims MOVEit breach | TechCrunch,Carly Page,2024-11-11,"Amazon has confirmed that employee data was compromised after a “security event” at a third-party vendor.
In a statement given to TechCrunch on Monday, Amazon spokesperson Adam Montgomery confirmed that employee information had been involved in a data breach.
“Amazon and AWS systems remain secure, and we have not experienced a security event. We were notified about a security event at one of our property management vendors that impacted several of its customers including Amazon. The only Amazon information involved was employee work contact information, for example work email addresses, desk phone numbers, and building locations,” Montgomery said.
Amazon declined to say how many employees were impacted by the breach. It noted that the unnamed third-party vendor doesn’t have access to sensitive data such as Social Security numbers or financial information and said the vendor had fixed the security vulnerability responsible for the data breach.
The confirmation comes after a threat actor claimed to have published data stolen from Amazon on notorious hacking site BreachForums. The individual claims to have more than 2.8 million lines of data, which they say was stolen during last year’s mass-exploitation of MOVEit Transfer.
The threat actor, operating under the alias “Nam3L3ss” claims to have published data allegedly stolen from 25 major organizations, cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock reports.
“What you have seen so far is less than .001% of the data I have,” the threat actor claims. “I have 1,000 releases coming never seen before.”
TechCrunch has contacted the other organizations listed by the threat actor but has not yet received any further responses.
The MOVEit breach, which saw attackers exploit a zero-day vulnerability in Progress Software’s file-transfer software, was the biggest hack of 2023.
These hacks, which were claimed by the notorious Clop ransomware and extortion gang, impacted more than 1,000 organisations, including the Oregon Department of Transportation (3.5 million records stolen), the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (four million) and U.S. government services contracting giant Maximus (11 million)."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/spacex-alums-find-traction-on-earth-with-their-mars-inspired-co2-to-fuel-tech/,SpaceX alums find traction on Earth with their Mars-inspired CO2-to-fuel tech | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-11,"A trend has emerged among a small group of climate tech founders who start with their eyes fixed on space and soon realize their technology would do a lot more good here on Earth.
Halen Mattison and Luke Neise fit the bill. Mattison spent time at SpaceX, while Neise worked at Vanderbilt Aerospace Design Laboratory and Varda Space Industries. The pair originally wanted to sell reactors to SpaceX that could turn carbon dioxide into methane for use on Mars. Today they’re building them to replace natural gas that’s pumped from underground.
Their company, General Galactic, which emerged from stealth in April, has built a pilot system that can produce 2,000 liters of methane per day. Neise, General Galactic’s CTO, told TechCrunch that he expects that figure to rise as the company replaces off-the-shelf components with versions designed in-house.
“We think that’s a big missing piece in the energy mix right now,” said Mattison, the startup’s CEO. “Being able to own our supply chains, to be able to fully control all of the parameters, to challenge the requirements between components, all of that unlocks some real elegance in the engineering solution.”
At commercial scale, the company’s reactors will be assembled using mass production techniques. It’s a contrast to how most petrochemical and energy facilities are built today.
General Galactic is focused on producing methane. However, Mattison said the company isn’t necessarily looking to displace the fuel from heating and energy. “Those are generally going toward electrification,” he said. Instead, it intends to sell its methane to companies that use it as an ingredient or to power a process, like in chemical or plastic manufacturing.
The company isn’t ruling out transportation entirely either. Mattison hinted that General Galactic is working on other hydrocarbons that could be used for transportation, like jet fuel. “Stay tuned,” he said.
The startup plans to deploy its first modules in 2025. To hit that milestone, it recently raised a $8 million seed round co-led by Harpoon Ventures and Refactor Capital with participation from BoxGroup, Climate Capital, Impact First, Pathbreaker, Plug and Play, and Seraphim.
General Galactic hopes its modules will be able to plug into existing infrastructure, speeding its adoption relative to other fuels like hydrogen.
General Galactic’s biggest competition probably won’t be from hydrogen, but from startups like Oxylus Energy, Aerleum, and SpiralWave, which are all working to produce green methanol. Methanol has a few things going for it: It’s a key building block for many fuels and petrochemicals and it’s a liquid at room temperature.
Methane doesn’t liquify until -258°F, and it’s a potent greenhouse gas, 80x more powerful than carbon dioxide. Leaky natural gas infrastructure is suspected to be a significant contributor to climate change. Unless General Galactic can all but eliminate leaks at the point of production and downstream, dependence on methane could undermine its carbon-neutral claims.
Still, relative to fossil fuels, methane produced using renewable electricity would have a lower carbon footprint. A liquid fuel targeted at industries like aviation and maritime shipping would be a juicier target from a climate perspective; it might be a good business bet, too, as those sectors are costly to decarbonize using batteries or hydrogen. The next pivot might be where General Galactic’s real opportunity lies."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/intuitive-machines-ceo-we-now-have-the-platform-for-a-lunar-economy/,Intuitive Machines CEO: 'We now have the platform for a lunar economy' | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-11-11,"Steve Altemus is optimistic. And as CEO of Intuitive Machines, which made history with the first ever successful moon landing performed by a private company, he has good reason. But that was just the opening act of his company’s plans to build “a full stack: all the pieces you need to create missions to the moon, on the moon, and around the moon.”
Altemus explained in an interview with TechCrunch that Intuitive Machines is uniquely positioned to support lunar missions and eventually a lunar economy, not just as a contractor for NASA or the Pentagon but as a full-fledged commercial space services company.
Intuitive Machines was recently made the sole awardee for the multi-billion-dollar cislunar communications services contract, meaning it’ll be the one to provide high-bandwidth comms for Artemis and any other mission going out that way.
“This is massive,” Altemus said. “Now we have the third leg of the stool to hold up the company.”
“We had the CLPS [commercial lunar payload services] contract, which was the delivery service; then we have the LTV [lunar terrain vehicle] contract, which is infrastructure as a service. The middle piece is really data transfer and analytics, with this commercial lunar data for Artemis — if you think about it, we now have the platform for a lunar economy,” he continued. “And we’re able to do it as a commercial supplier for those services.”
The alternative has historically been “exquisite” systems, tremendously expensive one-off missions like the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Technically astonishing — but with nine-figure price tags. Increasingly, government clients, civilians, and military have opted for more economical means of accomplishing the same thing; perhaps the best example is the use of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Dragon capsules to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS — this was once far more difficult and expensive a task.
Interestingly, Altemus credited a miscommunication with the present extent of its tech stack.
“When NASA first gave us the CLPS award, we had a misunderstanding. We thought they said, fly to the moon and give us data back, and you’re not permitted to use the Deep Space Network,” he said. Turns out they were allowed to use the DSN, but they worked under that constraint anyway. “We had to, from 2019, put in place a network to communicate from Earth to the moon to our lander and back. So by necessity we had to figure out that competency, we had to go into the communication and navigation areas, to get over the regulatory hurdles.”
The result is the company ended up with a far more robust solution than was strictly necessary, but that put it in pole position for the lunar communications contract — which indeed it won handily as sole provider.
Many might think that SpaceX, with its enormous Starlink satellite constellation, would be a natural fit to provide space communications services. But despite having superficial similarities (sending radio signals from space), these are very different problems being solved.
“When you think about lunar communications, it’s a fundamentally different physics question,” Altemus explained. “The environments need to be understood, the distances and situations need to be understood. We’ve operated in transit to the moon, in orbit around the moon, and on the surface of the moon, using a set of commercial ground stations, a dozen radio astronomy size dishes in different countries. And when you think about building a lunar lander, that’s a more complicated machine than a satellite that orbits the moon — so the talent is already inside the house.”
Though the lunar communications contract is the latest and most significant for Intuitive Machines, the Lunar Terrain Vehicle — a new Moon Buggy — is surely the easiest for ordinary people to appreciate. The company is working with AVL, Boeing, Michelin, and Northrop Grumman as a team, in competition with teams led by Lunar Outpost and Astrolab. The contract is not just to build a new lunar vehicle but operate and support it for 10 years; as Altemus pointed out, that makes it much more than a rover design job.
“If you think about it, this is the first piece of commercial infrastructure on the surface of the moon that has to be operated autonomously. You can be enamored with the buggy, but you still gotta deliver the service,” he said. “As a company, IM is the only one in the pool that has the lander to deliver the LTV, the LTV itself as a vehicle, and the comms and navigation systems to operate it autonomously on the moon. The company is very well set up for it.”
Not that building a lunar rover isn’t exciting in itself, though, he hastened to add.
“All three companies are building an Earth-based mockup to do fit checks and evaluation with human astronauts: How conducive is your design to getting on an off, removing and replacing equipment, how it operates and drives,” Altemus said. “It’s funny — we just had astronauts doing the test, and two of them had actually walked on the moon. Hearing about the Moon Buggy, how they operated, what it was like and how the soil felt … I’ll tell you, it was fascinating.”
Intuitive Machines isn’t on its way to becoming a new prime; the traditional procurement methods of cost plus awards are giving way to fixed-price contracts with built-in long tails of services and support. “Can [primes] operate in that environment? The key to U.S. competitiveness is for us to move faster; it’s speed and agility that allow companies like IM to be successful, while traditional aerospace companies have found it difficult to adapt.”
With 400 people and growing, Intuitive Machines is still relatively small, but it is hiring fast. It’s based in Houston for a reason, Altemus said: “When I left NASA and walked out of the gates of Johnson Space Center, one of the key things I decided was that this was a fantastic place to build a company: right outside of the human spaceflight center. The talent pool in this area is incredible. We hire from all over the country, but it’s attractive here. They see the culture of the company and the energy — they can feel what it’s like to win.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/the-best-gadgets-for-new-home-owners/,The best gadgets for new homeowners | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-11,"In August, I did something I never imagined myself doing: I bought a house. After spending most of my adult life in New York City, I moved a couple hours north to the Hudson Valley.
It’s been every bit as major an adjustment as I’d expected. Along with your standard new homeowner surprises — like a short-tailed shrew doing short-tailed shrew things in my laundry room — the move from renting to homeownership has brought a level of control I’ve never had over my own space.
For example, I’ve regularly turned down smart home products for review because I couldn’t install things like a smart doorbell in a place I didn’t own. It’s a small thing, perhaps, but I’ve spent much of the last couple of months making up for lost time.
Here’s a gift guide for the person in your life who recently moved — or for yourself, if that applies to you. Everything featured herein is something I’ve tested and currently use myself. Hopefully they’ll make your smart house feel a bit more like a smart home.
The Mac Studio M2 and a pair of Studio Displays currently serve as the centerpiece of my office. The Studio is a hugely powerful machine in a fairly small package, and the SD card slot on the front is great for all of the photos I need to take for my job.
If asked to make the choice today, however, I might opt for the pint-sized Mac Mini to free up a lot of space on my desk. Certainly the $599 entry point is appealing as well.
I messed up my back last year. Like really, really messed it up. Because of this, I’ve had to give up on my morning runs. Cycling is great, but it’s something I prefer to do on an actual bike. I’ve ultimately landed on rowing, which offers a full body workout with significantly less impact than running.
Aviron isn’t a big name in connected fitness, but the startup has produced a great rower with a clever content library. Rather than simply relying on trainer videos, the company built a suite of games designed to engage you as you work out. It’s a fun way to break a sweat.
Desks are important. Standing is also important. Ergo, standing desks are important. When I moved up from the city, I decided it was time to rid myself of the big, bulky desk I’d purchased secondhand over a decade ago. I wanted to see how the other half lived, so I reached out to Beflo about its over-the-top approach to the category. It’s kind of the Cadillac of standing desks.
The Tenon has all the bells and whistles and a starting price to match. The  desk has a mechanical lifting feature controllable via touchscreen or Beflo’s app. There are USB ports and even lights. Honestly, it may well be overkill for a majority of people, but it’s not a bad idea to invest in a desk that should last you a while.
I’ve wanted one of these since it was announced, but I’ve never had my own backyard. Bird Buddy is one of the first things I picked out for my new porch. The concept is simple enough: It’s a bird feeder with a camera. Of course, these sorts of products only work when well-implemented, and Bird Buddy brings clever innovations to the table. AI is used to capture videos and snapshots at the right time, and it has been expanding to include things like bird identification.
I will admit that it took a lot of trial and error to implement the system in a way that attracts the desired effects. Greedy squirrels were a challenge, though a conical baffle finally took care of the issue. Beyond that, the secret to Bird Buddy, like any other bird feeder, is patience. It can take birds weeks to find a new feeder. Once they do, however, word travels fast.
I’ve recommended Branch’s chairs to anyone who asks. The company makes a supremely comfortable desk chair that makes long workdays a little more bearable. They also look great.
I recently upgraded from the Ergonomic chair to the Verve — and I can fully recommend either one. The Verve is a bit pricier and nicer. Get a load of that coral color; that’ll break up your home office monotony.
In certain parts of the world, air purifiers are a must-have. As wildfires seem to get worse every year, that increasingly applies here in the U.S. I’m also a person with a lot of allergies who just moved to the woods, along with a prolifically shedding pet. I can’t say enough about how much a good purifier helps keep my home breathable.
Coway makes a HEPA purifier capable of cleaning up to 361 square feet in just over 12 minutes. Or you can clean up to 874 square feet in half an hour — which, honestly, covers most of my house. It also looks great, with a curved minimalist design you won’t feel like you need to hide when guests come over.
My Dyson and I have been through a lot. The vacuum has been banged against corners and dropped more times than I care to mention, but it’s still ticking. The biggest challenge of all, however, is a lionhead rabbit that seems to shed 5x her weight in hair every week. The Gen5detect is the only thing standing between me and a fur coat floor.
The floors in my new place are mostly hardwood, and the Dyson excels at sucking up particles and even the bits of hay scattered around my floor anytime the rabbit decides she’s mad at me. It handles the rugs equally well.
Dump your food waste into this $500 countertop appliance, hit Start, and in a couple of hours, everything from potato peels to lobster shells gets ground down into fertilizer for your growing army of houseplants. The FoodCycler is a win-win.
Here’s something embarrassing. I tested the Hisense C2 projector right before I had to leave town for a week to go to Disrupt. I found myself missing the experience. Nothing beats going to see a movie in a theater, but this high-end 4K laser projector comes close.
The picture is sharp and stunning, and the built-in speaker is plenty loud and clear. The system ships with a number of popular streaming apps built in, including Netflix and Disney+. Ultimately, however, I’ve opted to utilize the HDMI port to plug in the Apple TV 4K, while outputting the video to a pair of HomePods. As I write this, I’m really thinking about which foreign horror movie I’m going to stream on the Criterion app tonight.
It’s not the most exciting product category, but a good thermostat makes a heap of difference, both for your comfort levels and your energy bill. The Nest Learning Thermostat was surprisingly easy to install, speaking as someone with absolutely zero electrical experience.
The new display looks great and offers a lot of information at a glance, but I found that I’ve mostly forgotten it exists. That’s a net positive for a thermostat, the kind of product you only really think about when something’s gone wrong.
This was a fantastic housewarming gift from a colleague. Built by a small startup of the same name, Nightside is a warm and tall bedside lamp with an extremely clever track. The top rises and features an adjustable mirror that reflects a beam of light for reading in bed.
It’s testament to being innovative without being high-tech, and it hasn’t left my bedside since.
If you own a house, you need a range extender. My place is only a little over 1,000 square feet, but I found that roughly half of my rooms weren’t getting good Wi-Fi cover. This little range extender is super easy to set up and plugs directly into the wall.
I went for the dual-band model and have been happy with the performance, even as my army of smart-home products continues to grow."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/meta-taps-us-uk-universities-to-test-vr-in-education-creates-digital-twin-metaversities-in-europe/,"Meta taps US, UK universities to test VR in education, creates digital twin 'metaversities' in Europe | TechCrunch",Paul Sawers,2024-11-11,"As part of an ongoing effort to embed virtual reality (VR) in education, Meta has launched a new partnership with a slew of universities in the U.S. and U.K., designed to provide feedback on a new product that Meta hopes will finally make VR just a little more mainstream.
The new Meta for Education beta program will see Facebook’s parent company partner with 13 educational institutions, which will get access to an early version of a product that Meta has been teasing for a while already. In a blog post on Monday, Meta said it wants to “make it easier for educators to discover interactive and engaging content,” spanning subjects such as science, medicine, history, and language arts.
Ahead of the program’s formal launch, universities will be tasked with testing VR and mixed reality (XR) prototypes in class, ahead of a more formal launch in the future. The universities include Arizona State University, Houston Community College, Imperial College London, Miami Dade College, Morehouse College, New Mexico State University, San Diego State University, Savannah College of Art & Design, The University of Glasgow, University of Iowa, University of Leeds, University of Miami, and University of Michigan.
Meta also said it’s bringing its “digital twin” metaversity program to Europe, starting with the University of Leeds in the U.K.; University of the Basque Country in Spain; and the University of Hannover in Germany. This follows more than two years after Meta partnered with a company called VictoryXR to power virtual university programs in the U.S. — in environments that directly replicate their real-world campus counterparts.
Meta says “immersive classes” have begun already at the University of Leeds, with an initial focus on performance and theater. The University of Basque Country, meanwhile, will follow suit in February 2025 with classes on physiotherapy and anatomy, while the University of Hannover will offer immersive classes starting in the next academic year.
Today’s announcement comes some seven months after Meta teased a new education-focused product built around its Quest headsets, including a hub for education apps and tools, and controls to enable administrators to manage multiple headsets centrally. At the time, Meta said it planned to make the product available to “institutions serving learners aged 13+”; however, today’s news suggests that — for now, at least — it’s focusing on older learners.
However, it also shows that Meta is far from giving up on its costly VR endeavors — Meta’s Reality Labs outfit, focused on all things VR and AR, continues to hemorrhage money. Its most recent earnings showed that while revenue was up 29% year-on-year to $270 million, its expenses were also up, leading to an overall Q3 loss of $4.4 billion, a figure the company expects to keep growing due to “ongoing product development” and “investments to further scale our ecosystem.”
But with Apple throwing its hat into the immersive headset ring with the Vision Pro, some believe this could be the catalyst to catapult mixed reality — including VR and AR — into the mainstream arena."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/from-self-driving-cars-to-ai-that-writes-enterprise-software-cogna-founder-raises-15m/,From self-driving cars to AI that writes enterprise software: Cogna founder raises $15M | TechCrunch,Mike Butcher,2024-11-11,"A founder who was an early mover in the race to build autonomous vehicles has raised $15 million for his next act: a startup that claims its AI can write enterprise software on its own.
Cogna — as the U.K.-based startup is called — is led by Ben Peters, the technical co-founder of Five AI, a self-driving startup that was acquired by Bosch in 2022. Notion Capital is leading the Series A, with Hoxton Ventures and Chalfen Ventures also participating. It comes on the heels of Cogna, founded in May 2023, raising a seed round of $4.75 million earlier this year from a number of investors, including Peters’ Five AI co-founder Stan Boland and Hermann Hauser, the founder of Acorn Software.
The focus of Cogna is the world of enterprise resource planning. ERP is a dry but very necessary software component in the running of organizations, covering everything from procurement and supply chain and inventory management to risk assessments, finance, and human resources. Typically large enterprises can pay up to billions of dollars in contracts with systems integrators and consultancies to handle their ERP, either by customizing off-the-shelf software for clients or writing custom applications from the ground up, to fit an organization’s particular needs.
In typical AI startup fashion, Peters believes that this work is best done on, and can be compressed into, an AI platform built for the purpose. While some challenges have been significantly trickier for AI to address than others, there have been some early signs of ERP potentially being one area where it might stick, and for Cogna to potentially become one of the players delivering on that pitch. A year since launch, Cogna has signed up customers that include the U.K. gas distributor Cadent Gas and infrastructure and utilities service provider Network Plus.
“To be clear, none of our customers think of it as ERP software,” Peters said in an interview. “For them, they’ve got a problem which isn’t solved by using SAP or [another] legacy system. We deliver a custom, precision-built piece of software for that. They experience [it] like a classic piece of SaaS, but it happens to have been built specifically for them, specifically for their workflow. And it’s written by our AI.”
Cogna balances a mix of generative AI with other kinds of tooling to actually put together its custom software. Nontechnical teams can describe their pain points in natural language, and the Cogna does the rest, the company claims.
“We’re a team of experts in domain-specific languages, compilers, AI and reliable and scaleable enterprise SaaS,” Peters said.
These days, it’s not uncommon to come across AI startups leveraging multiple large language models simultaneously depending on a particular task at hand. It’s the customization that makes a startup unique — and that is the case here, too. Peters said that the language models used for people to interact with its platform come from a variety of providers that include OpenAI and Anthropic. These are “a key part of our ‘Natural Language Compiler,” Peters told TechCrunch over a call.
On top of that, Cogna is building an engine so that “the software can truly write itself,” said Hussein Kanji, the co-founder of Hoxton Ventures.
In doing so, Cogna is an example of how generative AI — which saw a viral explosion with the launch of consumer-accessible services like ChatGPT — is indeed being folded into enterprise usage and more complex applications. That is important because a number of foundational AI companies, like OpenAI, have made it clear that they, too, have ambitions to tap into the enterprise market, a highly lucrative area that will help them generate the vast revenues that investors expect.
Kanji likens what Cogna is doing to Cursor, the code building tool from OpenAI-backed Anysphere. We broke the news last week that Anysphere is in the middle of a massive, unsolicited bidding war among investors that want to back it, valuing Anysphere as high as $2.5 billion on the back of massive business growth, so the area is clearly very hot.
“That’s kind of what Cogna is also doing,” he said.
Based on his experience at self-driving tech company Five AI, Peters is adept at spotting openings in the market early, but he also has experience in how to shift gears, so to speak, when plans don’t go as you expect them to.
“We had cars driving around London in 2018,” he recalled. “[But] we then pivoted to providing the development environment to develop a stack for other companies that were building their own electronic design automation stack. We were running a million simulations a day by the time we sold the company.”
Cogna now plans to go up against classic IT consultancies such as Wipro and Capgemini.
The investment into Cogna is the first from Bryan Gartner, formerly of Khosla Ventures, who joined Hoxton as its newest partner last year."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/swiggy-listing-to-test-india-appetite-for-1-billion-plus-ipos/,Swiggy's public debut will test India's appetite for $1B+ IPOs | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-11-11,"Swiggy’s upcoming IPO on Wednesday will finally give many analysts a public comparable for what has been long considered to be the Indian internet stock: Zomato. It will also test the nation’s appetite for IPOs that can scale past the $1 billion mark.
For its IPO, Swiggy has already secured $1.4 billion from institutional investors, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, BlackRock and eight of the top 10 Indian mutual funds. Still, it will enter a public market where large tech companies’ stocks have struggled historically. Three years since its $2.5 billion offering, Paytm is still trading 47% below its IPO price.
More than a dozen Indian tech startups have gone public in the last four years, but the market has shown scant interest in large IPOs. Beauty and wellness e-commerce company Nykaa is still trading 53% below its debut price, and Star Health and Allied Insurance Company remains 48% below its IPO price three years on. Startups that raised less than $500 million in India have performed incredibly well in comparison.
India has emerged as a hotbed for tech IPOs this year even as the U.S. market remains muted. All eyes are on Swiggy’s IPO at the moment, particularly as many growth-stage startups — and their investors — are eyeing a similarly large listing over the next 24 months.
Furthermore, for many Indian startups that were based in the U.S. and Singapore, moving their official HQs back to India would let them better comply with local regulations to do such an IPO. It’s also an opportunity to reap the benefits of a market whose benchmark index had risen more than 10% in the past year. Up to three dozen startups could be shifting their domiciles back to India in the coming years, according to investors.
The prospects for Swiggy’s IPO looks good — especially given that rival Zomato’s stock has surged over 100% since its $1.3 billion listing in 2021, reaching a market cap high of $29 billion this year. In comparison, Swiggy is seeking a valuation of $11.3 billion.
It helps that the Indian food delivery market has long been a duopoly between Zomato and Swiggy. And what makes the offer even more attractive to investors is that Swiggy is among the dozen firms attempting to disrupt the $1.1 trillion Indian retail market that is still dominated by millions of mom-and-pop stores.
Swiggy’s Instamart is among the top three quick-commerce businesses in the country, which promises deliveries of groceries, wellness, and beauty products and much more within 10 minutes. Whether these companies will be able to revolutionize the broader retail market in India remains to be seen, but they have already captured 56% of the online grocery delivery market from e-commerce firms, according to JPMorgan.
Quick-commerce firms such as Instamart, Zomato-owned Blinkit, Zepto, BigBasket, and Minutes are changing consumer behavior in urban Indian cities, home to about 80 million people. Together, they are on track to record sales of more than $6 billion this year, according to TechCrunch estimates.
“I don’t think Swiggy will just be an e-commerce company in the future, but I do think that given the growth rate of Instamart, and the total addressable market it’s going after, the percentage of e-commerce in Swiggy is going to have a dramatic change,” said Swiggy co-founder and chief executive Sriharsha Majety (pictured above at the top) in an interview with TechCrunch.
Underpinning this business model is a unique supply chain system that involves strategically setting up hundreds of discrete warehouses, or “dark stores,” within kilometers of residential and business areas. This allows the firms to make deliveries within minutes of an order.
This approach differs from that of e-commerce players like Amazon and Flipkart, which have fewer but much larger warehouses in areas where rent is cheaper and farther from residential areas.
Swiggy operates over 600 such facilities, while Zomato’s Blinkit ended the September quarter with 791 stores.
Swiggy, which counts Prosus, SoftBank, Accel, and Elevation among its backers, has scaled Instamart to 30 Indian cities. But many investors and analysts have expressed doubts about the viability of extending the quick-commerce model to smaller Indian cities and towns.
“Do we have an operating model for city number 500? Honestly, I don’t know,” said Majety. Asked if the model works on city number 75, Majety said: “I think that probably exists. We will see city 75 having quick commerce.”
Swiggy’s IPO will also show how willing investors are to bet on business models that prioritize growth over profits amid challenging global conditions.
For Dutch investor Prosus, Swiggy’s listing could deliver a threefold return. It will also be the venture firm’s biggest hit from India, where its $1 billion-plus gains from Byju’s have all but evaporated. Accel is expected to see a more than 35-fold return, one of its largest in the past five years."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/11/brazilian-fintech-tako-emerges-from-stealth-with-sizable-seed-round-led-by-a16z-and-ribbit-capital/,Brazilian fintech Tako emerges from stealth with sizable seed round led by a16z and Ribbit Capital | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-11-11,"Running payroll is hard in any country, but perhaps especially so in Brazil thanks to consistently changing laws and extremely influential unions that make it significantly harder to get it right. Fernando Gadotti struggled with this as the co-founder of DogHero, LatAm’s version of Rover. When Gadotti left the company in 2022, after selling it in 2020, he decided this is where he wanted to focus next.
“Every time the payroll came around, there’s just a struggle, like it’s dreadful, many hours, just like double-checking data back and forth, and we couldn’t really get any insight that we needed,” Gadotti told TechCrunch. “[We were] pretty much working in the dark, and as we kept growing, it hit me that these problems really weren’t just inconvenient; they’re actually slowing the company down. We’re wasting a lot of time in busy work.”
Just a few months after leaving DogHero, Gadotti started working on São Paulo-based Tako, an employee life cycle platform that automates tasks like onboarding and payroll to save companies time and bring all their employee information into one place. Tako also provides employees with a dashboard to view information and access an interactive paystub meant to increase transparency.
Gadotti said that while there are U.S. legacy payroll companies operating in Brazil, like ADP, it makes sense to have a local solution because Brazil’s payment system is quite unique. He said laws around payroll change frequently. There are also 10,000 unions — companies often have employees in more than one, he said — that update their rules a few times a year, too, and sometimes have more power than the actual laws.
Tako uses an LLM (large language model) to keep up with these constant changes. The LLM ingests the labor law and union law data and digests it so Tako’s developers can keep the code base up-to-date. He said they want to keep humans in the loop to ensure accuracy, but having the LLM get a head start saves a lot of time.
Tako launched its product in 2023. Gadotti said that the company processed tens of millions of dollars in payroll as its been operating in stealth but declined to share more details on its customers. Gadotti said the company is currently targeting mid-market white-collar companies with between 100 and 500 employees in the professional and financial service categories.
“The strategy we took is that we are not trying to boil the ocean,” Gadotti said. “We want to start in a segment we know before venturing into industrials or more complex areas. We are starting in more simpler segments; as the company evolves, we are going to more complex segments in the future.”
Tako is emerging from stealth with a sizable $13.2 million seed round co-led by Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. The round also included ONEVC and the founders of Ramp. Gadotti said the company plans to put the majority of capital toward research and development in addition to doubling or tripling headcount on its R&D team.
There are a lot of potential areas that Tako could expand into in the future, like the vast world of employee benefits. Gadotti said the company does plan to expand as it grows into building more features like instant payments.
In addition to competing with legacy companies like ADP, there are multiple other HR tech startups in the country like Gupy and Caju, which are both more focused on other areas within HR and employee management. But if Tako expands into these areas, which it likely will, these companies could also become strong competitors.
The name Tako is Japanese for “octopus,” which Gadotti said is how he thinks about the business. Tako’s platform is meant to be the brain of employee data with its tentacles reaching out into different areas of employee management.
“We want to focus on the whole employee life cycle,” Gadotti said. “We are constantly listening to our customers’ pain points and where they want us to help them on.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/10/x-is-testing-a-free-version-of-ai-chatbot-grok/,X is testing a free version of AI chatbot Grok | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-11,"Social network X has so far limited its AI chatbot Grok (built by Elon Musk’s other company xAI) to its premium, paying users. However, the platform is seemingly preparing to open up the chatbot to free users.
Over the weekend, several app researchers and users posted about a free version of Grok being made available to people in certain regions.
TechCrunch was able to confirm that X is at least testing access to Grok for free users in New Zealand.
According to a researcher who goes by Swak on X, there are limits on the usage for now: 10 queries per two hours with the Grok-2 model, 20 queries per two hours with the Grok-2 mini model, and three image analysis questions per day.
To use Grok for free, your account should be at least seven days old and have a phone number linked to it.
xAI launched Grok-2 in August with image generation capacities, backed by Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.1 model. Late last month, the company also gave the model the ability to understand images.
All these features were available only to Premium and Premium+ users until now. By opening up Grok to free users, xAI is possibly looking for a more significant user base and faster feedback cycle for its products so that it can better compete with other models on the market like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.
Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that xAI was in talks to raise several billion dollars at a valuation of $40 billion."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/10/elon-musks-x-is-moving-its-legal-disputes-to-northern-texas/,Elon Musk’s X is moving its legal disputes to northern Texas | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-11-10,"Lawsuits against X (formerly Twitter) will soon be heard in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.
The shift was first announced last month as part of a broader set of changes to X’s terms of service and privacy policy. Now, with the changes set to take effect on November 15, The Washington Post spoke to a number of legal and tech experts about what the move might mean.
X owner Elon Musk also recently moved the social media company’s headquarters from San Francisco to Bastrop, Texas — near Austin — but Bastrop lies in Texas’ Western District.
The Northern District, meanwhile, has become a destination for conservative activists seeking to challenge Democratic policies, with 10 of its 11 active judges appointed by Republican presidents.
While it’s normal for companies to specify in their terms of service where lawsuits against them may be filed, Cornell law professor G.S. Hans described choosing the Northern District of Texas as “weird” compared to the Northern District of California, which most tech companies choose. Hans said the Texas district “just doesn’t have as much of a volume or history” with tech lawsuits."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/10/its-the-senates-last-chance-to-pass-the-press-act/,It's the Senate's last chance to pass the PRESS Act | TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,2024-11-10,"Folks in America: Your senators only have a few weeks left to pass the PRESS Act, a federal “shield” bill that the House passed with unanimous, bipartisan support in January but has been waiting in the Senate for a final vote ever since.
The PRESS Act, if passed into law, would enshrine nationwide protections for journalists across the United States from being forced to identify or give up their confidential sources (except in emergency cases, like to prevent an act of terrorism). The bill also grants other protections, such as limiting what records the government can secretly take from journalists or their email or phone provider that could identify their sources — again, with a narrow set of exceptions for emergency threats.
Lawmakers have been pushing to pass federal protections for journalists in the PRESS Act for the past year, citing recent U.S. government abuses, including the secret seizure of phone records from journalists who worked for CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post at the request of the Justice Department under the Trump administration. As noted last week by The Verge, protections for journalists and their sources will become increasingly relevant in a second Trump term.
Forcing journalists to turn over a source’s identity can have a real chilling effect on newsgathering. People will feel discouraged from talking to journalists, and that harms the public’s ability to be informed about things that affect them. We also increasingly consume our news from independent journalists and smaller outlets, which might not have the legal resources to fight a government subpoena for their records. The PRESS Act would provide the same blanket protections to journalists across the United States and would also cover independent journalists and outlets that publish information in the public interest.
While the bill doesn’t affect the tech industry directly, as a news outlet, we’re in favor of protecting and building upon press freedoms. Some of TechCrunch’s most read and impactful reporting has come from readers like you, who have reached out and tipped us off to corporate wrongdoing, unearthing mismanagement in the startup world, detailing human rights abuses, and revealing major breaches and data spills, cyberattacks, and criminality that otherwise might have gone unreported. TechCrunch has a history of standing up to legal demands to protect our sources. We can only do this with the protections of press freedoms.
At this point, the PRESS Act already has bipartisan support in the Senate, with Senators Ron Wyden, Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee, and Dick Durbin as co-sponsors. The bill is just waiting for a final vote on the Senate floor, with weeks to go before the bill expires at the end of the congressional session.
The ACLU has a web form if you want to send a note to your senators, or you can call or email them directly to ask them to vote for the PRESS Act."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/10/tsmc-reportedly-halts-advanced-chip-shipments-to-chinese-companies/,TSMC reportedly halts advanced chip shipments to Chinese companies | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-11-10,"After a chip manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was found inside a Huawei processor, the U.S. Department of Commerce has ordered the company to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers, according to a report in Reuters.
Huawei faces significant trade restrictions from the U.S., so the pause on shipments is supposed to allow the government to determine whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei.
TSMC reportedly notified affected customers that it will be halting shipments starting Monday. The advanced chips being targeted are often used for artificial intelligence applications — an area where the U.S. has already been restricting chip exports from companies like Nvidia.
In a statement provided to Reuters and other publications, TSMC said it is “committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/10/equal-has-a-plan-to-fight-indias-growing-cyber-fraud-problem/,Equal has a plan to fight India's growing cyber fraud problem | TechCrunch,Jagmeet Singh,2024-11-10,"India, the world’s most populous country and the second-largest internet market after China, is becoming increasingly digitally active. However, this rapid digitization comes with a growing risk of online fraud.
Cyber fraud is mounting in India to the point where the Indian government estimates it could amount to 0.7% of the country’s GDP — over $14 billion — within the next year. Even the government-backed systems, including Aadhaar, have been targeted by bad actors in some cases.
New Delhi keeps introducing new regulatory requirements to limit fraudulent digital transactions. Nonetheless, these updates often place a burden on businesses to regularly update their tech. Efforts to eradicate digital fraud sometimes also result in disruptions. For instance, the recent clampdown on unauthorized use of the permanent account number disrupted transactions for some fintech platforms.
Equal, a Hyderabad-based startup, aims to address all this with its suite of identity verification and financial data-sharing products.
The two-year-old startup helps businesses streamline know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance by integrating more than 50 identity databases and thousands of API providers. The startup also recently acquired an undisclosed stake in account aggregator OneMoney to combine its identity verification services with the latter’s consent-based financial data sharing.
“Data sharing is still a major problem in this country if it’s not done digitally with consent,” Keshav Reddy, the son of GVK Group’s vice chairman GV Sanjay Reddy, told TechCrunch.
Reddy founded Equal with former Swiggy engineering director Rajeev Ranjan after moving back to India from the U.S.
For over the last two years, Reddy bootstrapped Equal, and the startup has added more than 350 customers, including State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Reliance Jio, Airtel, Uber, and Zoom.
The startup has now raised a Series A round of $10 million at a post-money valuation of $80 million to scale its operations, expand the product suite, and forge strategic partnerships. The round was led by Prosus Ventures, along with Tomales Bay Capital and Reddy himself, and saw participation from other investors, including Blume Ventures, DST Global Partners, Gruhas VC, and Quona VC.
Equal is not alone in the space, as the market already has players such as Perfios (backed by Warburg Pincus and Teachers’ Venture Growth), IDfy (backed by TransUnion), and Bureau (backed by GMO VenturePartners). However, Reddy told TechCrunch that unlike the competition, Equal plays the role of an aggregator and partners even with some of its competitors.
Ravi Kumar, co-founder and CEO of Upstox, who has also invested in Equal’s maiden round and is one of the early customers for its identity verification and account aggregator, told TechCrunch that it’s the cost and uptime that gives the trading platform a reason not to look for building a similar tech in-house.
Upstox has been using Equal for about a year and is processing around 350,000 transactions a month. Before that, Kumar said, the platform was relying on existing ID-verification providers.
“Equal has been able to aggregate across a slew of different APIs and ensures very high uptime between all those different connections,” he said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/10/encore-is-an-ai-powered-search-engine-for-your-thrifting-needs/,Encore is an AI-powered search engine for your thrifting needs | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-10,"Former Apple engineer Alex Ruber and former Twitter and Asana engineer Parth Chopra first met on Y Combinator’s founder match platform, then met in person at a thrift store for shopping. They later went on a thrift store shopping trip where they talked about solving problems with finding the right product in the online space.
Many consumers struggle to find the right item without spending hours on Instagram. To address this, the duo is building the search engine Encore, which lets users search for secondhand items from different sources. The startup is currently part of Y Combinator’s first-ever fall batch.
“The entire secondhand shopping market is really fragmented. There are hundreds of resources out there, such as Depop, Mercari, ThredUp, eBay, Craigslist, and more. It’s hard for consumers to sift through them all to try and get to the product you are looking for. So we wanted to remove that friction for users,” Ruber said on a call with TechCrunch.
Both Ruber and Chopra are immigrants from Romania and India, he said, and they’ve been used to spending time and money at thrift stores.
But thrifting isn’t easy. When Ruber tried to find a specific jacket from a TV show (Carmy’s patchwork jacket from “The Bear”), he started thinking about building a product to help him with that. He also wanted to look for a co-founder working in the circular economy space. He noted that Chopra was a great match because he was into fashion and thrifting.
“For me, there was also personal interest because my mom used to take me to flea markets every Sunday. I bought a lot of stuff from those places, including a piano, when I started to learn the instrument. The core idea behind both flea markets and Encore is about finding a hidden gem,” the former Apple engineer noted.
On Encore, you can type your query and get matches from multiple resources, including Poshmark, the RealReal, Grailed, Etsy, and eBay. Because Encore uses a large language model tech, you can type a query like “Show me a dress that Emily wore in ‘Emily in Paris’ Season 3 Episode 4.”
The search engine also shows partial prompts such as “Outfit inspo for” and “Shop from the Show.” When you tap on them, you can complete the prompt through auto-populated suggestions or your own words. Mainly this is to show users the different kinds of search terms they can use and avoid a blank page when users don’t yet understand the search engine’s capabilities.
Ruber noted that sentence length can vary, sometimes by a lot. Some people just key in a simple sentence like “Show me jeans” while others write a detailed description like “I am a 6’2″ person who skies and looking for skier pants under $100 with no big logos on them.”
The secondhand retail market is on an upward growth curve, with analysts projecting it to reach $73 billion in the U.S. and $350 billion globally by 2028. A report by online thrift store ThredUp notes that online secondhand resale would account for half of the secondhand market in 2025.
Encore processes over 50,000 searches per month and is seeing 26% month-on-month growth for searches and 15% growth in clicks.
The startup currently relies on affiliate shares for revenue generation. However, the company is also experimenting with a $3 per month subscription providing unlimited searches with advanced models, finding items by uploading images, and offering support via email and chat.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/10/a16z-vc-martin-casado-explains-why-so-many-ai-regulations-are-so-wrong/,a16z VC Martin Casado explains why so many AI regulations are so wrong | TechCrunch,Julie Bort,2024-11-10,"The problem with most attempts at regulating AI so far is that lawmakers are focusing on some mythical future AI experience, instead of truly understanding the new risks AI actually introduces.
So argued Andreessen Horowitz general partner VC Martin Casado to a standing-room crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 last week. Casado, who leads a16z’s $1.25 billion infrastructure practice, has invested in such AI startups as World Labs, Cursor, Ideogram, and Braintrust.
“Transformative technologies and regulation has been this ongoing discourse for decades, right? So the thing with all the AI discourse is it seems to have kind of come out of nowhere,” he told the crowd. “They’re kind of trying to conjure net-new regulations without drawing from those lessons.”
For instance, he said, “Have you actually seen the definitions for AI in these policies? Like, we can’t even define it.”
Casado was among a sea of Silicon Valley voices who rejoiced when California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed the state’s attempted AI governance law, SB 1047. The law wanted to put a so-called kill switch into super-large AI models — aka something that would turn them off. Those who opposed the bill said that it was so poorly worded that instead of saving us from an imaginary future AI monster, it would have simply confused and stymied California’s hot AI development scene.
“I routinely hear founders balk at moving here because of what it signals about California’s attitude on AI — that we prefer bad legislation based on sci-fi concerns rather than tangible risks,” he posted on X a couple of weeks before the bill was vetoed.
While this particular state law is dead, the fact it existed still bothers Casado. He is concerned that more bills, constructed in the same way, could materialize if politicians decide to pander to the general population’s fears of AI, rather than govern what the technology is actually doing.
He understands AI tech better than most. Before joining the storied VC firm, Casado founded two other companies, including a networking infrastructure company, Nicira, that he sold to VMware for $1.26 billion a bit over a decade ago. Before that, Casado was a computer security expert at Lawrence Livermore National Lab.
He says that many proposed AI regulations did not come from, nor were supported by, many who understand AI tech best, including academics and the commercial sector building AI products.
“You have to have a notion of marginal risk that’s different. Like, how is AI today different than someone using Google? How is AI today different than someone just using the internet? If we have a model for how it’s different, you’ve got some notion of marginal risk, and then you can apply policies that address that marginal risk,” he said.
“I think we’re a little bit early before we start to glom [onto] a bunch of regulation to really understand what we’re going to regulate,” he argues.
The counterargument — and one several people in the audience brought up — was that the world didn’t really see the types of harms that the internet or social media could do before those harms were upon us. When Google and Facebook were launched, no one knew they would dominate online advertising or collect so much data on individuals. No one understood things like cyberbullying or echo chambers when social media was young.
Advocates of AI regulation now often point to these past circumstances and say those technologies should have been regulated early on.
Casado’s response?
“There is a robust regulatory regime that exists in place today that’s been developed over 30 years,” and it’s well-equipped to construct new policies for AI and other tech. It’s true, at the federal level alone, regulatory bodies include everything from the Federal Communications Commission to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. When TechCrunch asked Casado on Wednesday after the election if he stands by this opinion — that AI regulation should follow the path already hammered out by existing regulatory bodies — he said he did.
But he also believes that AI shouldn’t be targeted because of issues with other technologies. The technologies that caused the issues should be targeted instead.
“If we got it wrong in social media, you can’t fix it by putting it on AI,” he said. “The AI regulation people, they’re like, ‘Oh, we got it wrong in like social, therefore we’ll get it right in AI,’ which is a nonsensical statement. Let’s go fix it in social.“"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/10/these-are-the-top-apps-gen-z-young-adults-downloaded-this-year/,These are the top apps Gen Z young adults downloaded this year | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-11-10,"It’s clear that Gen Z has an influence on app consumption. Known as the “mobile-first generation,” they make up about 40% of all mobile users worldwide. Curious about their preferences, we recently contacted the app intelligence firm Appfigures, which provided an overview of the 50 most downloaded apps by Gen Z this year.
Due to privacy rules, we were unable to obtain data for users aged 13 to 17. The firm only shared total download numbers for users aged 18 to 24, and the data is limited to users in the U.S., so it doesn’t provide a complete picture. Even so, this gives us an idea of the preferences among the older segment of this generation.
From popular e-commerce and social media platforms to photo editing tools, let’s take a closer look at the apps that have resonated with this demographic in 2024.
Based on data from iOS and Android users in the U.S., the most downloaded app from January to October was Temu, the popular online marketplace that offers nearly every type of product you can think of at heavily discounted rates.
Gen Z young adults have downloaded the app 41.98 million times, indicating that the vast selection of affordable items is highly appealing to this particular group despite their dedication to sustainability and the ongoing debates around fast fashion. Temu also bets on gamification strategies to motivate shoppers, such as coupons, rewards, and free gifts.
In contrast to Temu, its competitor, Shein, managed to garner only 14.68 million new downloads. The figure doesn’t necessarily reflect a dwindling interest in the app. Instead, it suggests that this specific demographic of young adults may have already installed it on their devices.
Not surprisingly, TikTok is in second place next to Temu with 33.23 million downloads. The short-form video app is popular among users aged 18 to 24 for several reasons, the most obvious being that it serves as a go-to source for fast-paced, easily digestible content. Interestingly enough, the Gen Z-dominated app is also preferred as a search engine over Google.
Another major video platform, YouTube, remains popular among Gen Z young adults. Over a span of around 10 months, the mobile app amassed 14.03 million new installs, Appfigures noted. While this number is not as high as TikTok’s, it still indicates significant engagement among this group.
They also seem to be driving growth in the short drama app industry. One of the latest apps gaining attention is ShortMax, which features about 1,000 short films across various genres, including drama, romance, and mysteries. Data shows that 18- to 24-year-olds have installed the app over 10 million times so far in 2024.
In addition to their spending and streaming habits, Gen Z young adults have also been downloading Meta’s family of apps. Threads tops the list at 32.32 million installs, followed by WhatsApp at 28.42 million, Instagram at 26.29 million, Facebook at 20.58 million, and Messenger at 17.63 million.
Since Threads was the most recent to launch, it makes sense that it has more new downloads. Additionally, there seems to be renewed interest in Facebook following the redesign aimed at engaging this social media-savvy generation. (While we cannot definitively determine whether the update directly influenced the spike in downloads, it’s worth noting the potential correlation.)
Google, another tech giant, has also amassed a decent amount of downloads so far this year. The search engine app saw 17.65 million installs, whereas other Google-owned products Chrome and Meet saw 10.19 million installs and 9.63 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Google Drive garnered 7.22 million downloads, and Google Photos had 6.79 million.
Another not-so-shocking discovery was that OpenAI’s ChatGPT continues to be favored among 18- to 24-year-olds, gaining 24.63 million app installs. With many Gen Z young adults either starting college or entering the early stages of their careers, ChatGPT has emerged as a favored resource for educational purposes and career guidance. A survey conducted by Best Colleges revealed that 43% of college students have admitted to using ChatGPT or similar AI tools.
Another AI-powered app getting traction was AI study companion Gauth. The app, developed by TikTok parent company ByteDance, achieved 8.37 million new installs. While it has existed since 2021, Gauth saw a surge in downloads earlier this year, becoming the second most downloaded education app for iOS devices in the U.S. in April.
For Gen Z, photo sharing and social media apps are integral to their daily lives. So it’s safe to say that a lot of these types of platforms would make it to the list.
In addition to Threads and Instagram ranking highly, ByteDance’s CapCut is another platform favored by Gen Z young adults. The video editing app is known for its range of effects and filters, making it easy to upload edited content to TikTok and other compatible platforms. Data indicates that the app saw 21.72 million new downloads.
Another app from ByteDance, Lemon8, has also gained some traction among this age group, with 7.7 million downloads. Although this Instagram copycat has been slow to grow in the U.S., it seems to be making progress with its target audience.
Others on the list include Snapchat with 19.16 million installs, followed by Telegram with 13.12 million, Pinterest at 8.23 million, Reddit at 8.06 million, and X at 7.58 million.
So far this year, Netflix has been the top streaming service to attract the most 18- to 24-year-olds with 15.67 million installs. Prime Video and Disney+ are not far behind, with 12.86 million and 11.68 million downloads, respectively. Max, Peacock, and Tubi each have around 7 million downloads or more.
And it appears the music streaming app capturing lots of interest among Gen Z young adults is none other than the leading platform, Spotify. This app has attracted 10.45 million downloads, highlighting its significant appeal to this age group.
Lastly, we took a look at download data for payment apps to determine which platforms are most popular among young adults for making purchases, splitting bills, and sending tips. PayPal, an established player in the market, experienced a jump in new downloads, totaling 13.92 million. Venmo followed with 7.8 million downloads, while Cash App recorded 6.9 million downloads."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/10/open-source-projects-draw-equity-free-funding-from-corporates-startups-and-even-vcs/,"Open source projects draw equity-free funding from corporates, startups, and even VCs | TechCrunch",Paul Sawers,2024-11-10,"A dearth of funding for vital open source technologies is leading to a swath of support from startups, unicorns, corporations, and even venture capital firms.
Last year, Bloomberg launched its FOSS (free and open source software) fund, committing up to $90,000 per year to various projects. And in October, Indian financial services company Zerodha launched a similar initiative dubbed FLOSS/fund, pledging $1 million annually to open source projects. The reason? “A significant portion of our success and growth is owed to FOSS,” Zerodha CTO Kailash Nadh said at the time.
“It goes without saying that this holds true for nearly every technology company founded in the last decade, whether it is publicly acknowledged or not,” Nadh added.
While there is no shortage of companies building businesses and raising money off the back of open source software, not every community-driven project lends itself to becoming a commercial entity. Some open source tools are more akin to Lego blocks: key components of a software stack, for sure, but difficult to monetize directly — particularly in the early days.
And this is why we’ve seen a steady rise in funding initiatives come to the fore. This includes reactive programs, such as 2022’s Big Tech-driven $30 million pledge to bolster open source security in the wake of the Log4Shell security flaw that wreaked havoc on the software supply chain. But we’re also seeing more proactive efforts, driven from all corners of industry.
Silicon Valley VC Sequoia Capital launched an open source fellowship in 2023 to support project maintainers with equity-free capital to cover living expenses for up to 12 months. Its inaugural fellow was Colombian software developer Sebastián Ramírez Montaño, creator of FastAPI, an open source web framework for building APIs.
In February, Sequoia revealed it would start accepting applications from any developer leading an open source project, with plans to provide funding for up to three qualifying projects annually. Nine months on, and the first two fellows from Sequoia’s expanded program have now been revealed: Chatbot Arena, a popular open source AI model benchmarking tool used by many of the industry’s biggest names, including OpenAI, Meta, and Google; and vLLM, an open source library focused on memory management to power faster and cheaper LLM serving.
Chatbot Arena, which spun out of a broader research organization called LMSYS, is the handiwork of doctorate students Wei-Lin Chiang and Anastasios Angelopoulos from Berkeley’s Sky Computing Lab. With north of 1 million monthly users, Chatbot Arena is all about helping LLM developers validate claims around their models’ performance, while anyone can test these models and vote for their preferences. Companies such as OpenAI often share versions of their models with the Chatbot Arena team ahead of the models’ release to help fine-tune things before their formal launch.
While Chatbot Arena receives financing as part of the creators’ doctorate research work at the Sky Computing Lab, the Sequoia fellowship award of $100,000 will help fund further technical development, including building a better interface.
“The Sequoia grant supports the development of Chatbot Arena’s website, covering full-stack development and server maintenance costs,” Chiang told TechCrunch. “This is a gift to support the open source project, with no future obligations.”
Sequoia isn’t the only VC firm to lend equity-free support to Chatbot Arena; Andreessen Horowitz launched an open source AI grant program last August, and Chatbot Arena’s umbrella outfit LMSYS was among the second cohort of recipients.
Chiang said that there are no plans to evolve the project into a commercial entity, underscoring the need for alternative sources of financing — now, and perhaps long into the future.
“As part of our long-term vision, we may establish a nonprofit organization to host the leaderboard, keeping our focus on broad accessibility and community impact,” Chiang said.
In tandem, Berkeley’s Sky Computing Lab also birthed vLLM in 2022, spearheaded by researchers Zhuohan Li, Woosuk Kwon, and Simon Mo, who started the project after developing a system to distribute complex processes across multiple GPUs more efficiently. vLLM leans on a new “attention algorithm” dubbed PagedAttention, which helps reduce memory waste and is already being used by developers at companies such as AWS, Cloudflare, and Nvidia.
Similar to Chatbot Arena, vLLM serves as the focal point of its creators’ PhD research work, and future commercialization is not currently on the agenda.
“At the moment, we do not have a plan to transition it into a stand-alone company — we are solely focused on making the open source project useful and widely adopted,” Mo said.
In addition to Sequoia’s $100,000 contribution for the year, other public sponsors include Andreessen Horowitz, which donated as part of its inaugural open source AI grant program last year, while the likes of AWS, Nvidia, and others have collectively helped vLLM cover its compute resources — which are not insignificant.
“For vLLM, we intend to use the fund to cover our continuous integration testing and benchmark suite,” Mo said. “These suites, running on GPUs, are expensive to maintain but critical to ensure the performance and correctness of vLLM for production usage.”
One clear message emerges from all this: AI and data infrastructure might be driving demand for open source technologies, but this demand creates significant costs for the project maintainers. Ion Stoica, professor of the computer science division at Berkeley and a Sky Computing Lab adviser, says that the funding pressure on open source project maintainers is “at least an order of magnitude higher” with the advent of LLMs.“You have multiple kinds of GPUs, you have all of these other accelerators, and there’s also a difference in scale,” he said. “Ten years ago, most of the funding for a new startup would go to adding people; today, it’s going to infrastructure.”
Digging a little deeper, and it’s clear that Sequoia’s involvement isn’t quite as altruistic as it might seem, owing to the fact that its two new fellows intersect with startups in its existing investment portfolio. By way of example, vLLM is used by Replicate, which Sequoia (and Andreessen Horowitz) backed across its Series A and Series B rounds.
Elsewhere, Sequoia last year co-led a $5 million seed round into an AI startup called Factory, with the startup’s founder and CTO Eno Reyes confirming that his company uses Chatbot Arena to “keep close track” of the top LLM options.
“They’re a key input to make sure we have the best product for our users,” Reyes said.
Similarly, Sequoia’s first fellowship award last year, FastAPI, leans heavily on Pydantic, the popular data validation library created by the eponymous startup in Sequoia’s portfolio.
However, Sequoia Capital partner Lauren Reeder told TechCrunch that this cross-pollination between fellows and portfolio isn’t a strict condition of its funding decisions, merely a “nice bonus” when things do align. And in truth, when an open source project is genuinely popular, there’s every chance that it will be picked up by one of Sequoia’s portfolio companies, which is a good way for the VC firm to hear about worthwhile projects.
In terms of how the funding is dispersed, Reeder says it’s open to whatever suits the team in question. For FastAPI, this involved making a direct payment to Montaño himself, which was simpler given that it was just the one individual. But where teams are involved, it makes sense to use a third-party fundraising platform such as Open Collective, which also comes with added transparency.
“For the two most recent fellows, we were supporting small groups rather than a single individual and Open Collective made it easier to manage the funds,” Reeder said. “Similarly, we’ve done both up-front payments as multi-install payments, depending on the needs of the project. Open Collective is more transparent, but the fees are not insignificant.”
There have been numerous other efforts to formalize open source project financing in the past five years alone, including dedicated FOSS funds from Indeed and Salesforce, a tacit acknowledgment that critical components of the tech stack are crying out for support.
One of the biggest efforts of late, however, hails from developer tooling unicorn Sentry, which itself has been donating to open source projects for many years. In 2021, Sentry adopted a more systematic program with firmer and more transparent commitments, and last month the company officially launched the Open Source Pledge to encourage other companies to get involved — either by donating directly through platforms such as GitHub Sponsors or Thanks.dev, or indirectly via foundations.
“We’ve run our program successfully for three years, but it’s not enough by itself to solve the open source sustainability crisis. So this year David [Sentry co-founder David Cramer] asked me to get other companies on board to make a bigger impact,” Sentry’s head of open source, Chad Whitacre, told TechCrunch.
The rules of engagement are thus: Commitments should amount to at least $2,000 per year for each developer the member company has on staff, which for Sentry itself translated to around $500,000 last year — $3,704 for each of its 135 developer headcount. Beneficiaries through the years have included Django, Python, Rust, and Apache. This year, Sentry has upped its own budget to $750,000, and with some two dozen additional members signed up to the Pledge at the time of writing, Whitacre is hopeful that open source software developers will see a little more compensation in the future.
“The primary intent with the Pledge is no-strings-attached payments to open source maintainers,” Whitacre said. “We vet companies when they join to ensure they’re complying with our guidelines, but there’s a fair amount of latitude within those guidelines.”
Aside from corporate members contributing cash, the Pledge has also attracted “ecosystem partners” to endorse the pledge, which includes foundations, individuals, and even storied VC firm Accel, which itself has invested in numerous open source startups through the years (including Sentry, both before and after it transitioned away from an open source license in 2019).
Accel partner Dan Levine said that if something is “truly critical,” then it should, in theory, be able to sustain itself as a business. The reality, though, is that if enough companies and developers are deriving value from a given open source project, there shouldn’t be any issues in getting financial support — at least in the early days, before the maintainers can forge a path to commercialization.
“In the case of open source software, while it can be used for free, users who find it essential are inherently motivated to ensure its sustainability,” Levine told TechCrunch. “The open source community, particularly on the demand side, needs to reassess its strategies and make more informed decisions to support critical projects. The Pledge is an excellent effort to galvanize the demand side to do what’s in their own best interests.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/09/ftx-bankruptcy-estate-sues-anthony-scaramucci-fwd-us-others/,"FTX bankruptcy estate sues Anthony Scaramucci, FWD.us, others | TechCrunch",Anthony Ha,2024-11-10,"Bankrupt cryptocurrency company FTX filed 23 lawsuits Friday against Anthony Scaramucci (pictured above), his hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, and other organizations, including Crypto.com and the Mark Zuckerberg-backed lobbying group Fwd.us.
These lawsuits are an attempt to claw back money for FTX’s creditors following the company’s collapse. FTX claims that the money targeted in these suits was part of “a campaign of influence-buying” by founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, conducted as the company was struggling to meet its own cashflow needs.
The lawsuit claims, “These ‘investments’ conveyed little to no benefit to Debtors, and instead served only to prop up Bankman-Fried’s standing in the worlds of politics and traditional finance,” which he then attempted to leverage as “potential sources of equity investment in FTX to fill the hole in the balance sheet and, therefore, keep his scheme afloat.”
Since the company went bankrupt, FTX executives have been convicted of crimes, including fraud and money laundering. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison and is currently appealing his conviction.
In the case of SkyBridge and Scaramucci (a financier who briefly served as White House communications director under Donald Trump), FTX announced that it was acquiring a 30% stake in SkyBridge in September 2022, just a few months before FTX went bankrupt and Bankman-Fried was arrested.
According to the lawsuit, FTX also paid $12 million to sponsor Scaramucci’s SALT conferences and invested $10 million in the SkyBridge Coin Fund. In return, FTX claims Scaramucci took Bankman-Fried on “a whirlwind tour of the U.S. and the Middle East” to pitch potential investors, with Scaramucci “so invested in the success of Bankman-Fried’s fundraising efforts that he lent Bankman-Fried his own suit and tie in advance of their meetings so that Bankman-Fried wouldn’t show up to important meetings in his trademark shorts and a t-shirt.”
The Fwd.us lawsuit, meanwhile, describes payments from FTX’s corporate sibling Alameda Research to Fwd.us as “part of an integrated plan by the FTX Insiders to siphon money from FTX Group creditors and enhance their own personal reputations at the expense of creditors.”
SkyBridge and Fwd.us did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment."

Employees who tested the new model, code-named Orion, reportedly found that even though its performance exceeds OpenAI’s existing models, there was less improvement than they’d seen in the jump from GPT-3 to GPT-4.
In other words, the rate of improvement seems to be slowing down. In fact, Orion might not be reliably better than previous models in some areas, such as coding.
In response, OpenAI has created a foundations team to figure out how the company can continue to improve its models in the face of a dwindling supply of new training data. These new strategies reportedly include training Orion on synthetic data produced by AI models, as well as doing more to improve models during the post-training process.
OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In response to previous reports about plans for its flagship model, the company said, “We don’t have plans to release a model code-named Orion this year.”"

404 Media reported Thursday that law enforcement officials were warning each other that phones being stored for forensic examination seemed to be rebooting themselves — something that security experts confirmed in a follow-up story. After the reboot, it’s harder for those phones to be unlocked by password-cracking tools.
Apple did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.
This reboot appears to take place when iPhones with iOS 18.1 have not been unlocked for a set period of time. According to Chris Wade, founder of mobile analysis company Corellium, iPhones seem to reboot after their fourth day of being in a locked state.
Matthew Green, a cryptographer and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, described this as “a huge improvement in terms of security” that “probably doesn’t inconvenience anyone” — though the police might disagree."

But per the Washington Post, a new study of more than 83,000 adults found that standing for more than two hours a day not only doesn’t protect against cardiovascular risks, but it also heightens an individual’s risk of circulatory problems, including varicose veins, abnormally low blood pressure, and blood clots. Standing also burns just nine extra calories per hour.
Sitting too much is still problematic, the researchers note — physical inactivity is definitely bad news. The answer instead is moving every 30 minutes or so, suggests University of Sydney professor Emmanuel Stamatakis, who oversaw the study. “[M]uscular contraction is a necessary condition for any activity to maintain or improve health,” he tells the Post."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/09/as-firefox-turns-20-mozilla-ponders-how-to-restore-it-to-its-former-glory/,"As Firefox turns 20, Mozilla ponders how to restore it to its former glory | TechCrunch",Frederic Lardinois,2024-11-09,"Exactly 20 years ago, Mozilla started shipping version 1.0 of its Firefox browser. At the time, you could download it or buy a CD-ROM with a guidebook from Mozilla (or maybe get it on one of those free CDs that would come with many magazines at the time). Born out of the ashes of Netscape, Firefox would go on to gain well over 30% of global market share. But that was followed by a period of stagnation, and after the arrival of the faster and lighter Google Chrome, Firefox slowly but surely lost market share. It didn’t help that Mozilla, at the time, seemingly prioritized everything but its browser, all while its mobile browser initiatives never quite took off.
Despite everything, Firefox is still going strong, and it is a better browser today than it ever was. Now, Mozilla, which recently said that it wants to refocus on the browser, needs to figure out how to get it back on a growth path.
On the occasion of Firefox’s 20th birthday, I talked to Mozilla interim CEO Laura Chambers, who took over from Mitchell Baker earlier this year. Speaking from her home in Australia, Chambers told me at the time that one of the first things she did when she stepped into this role was to “unlock a bunch of money towards Firefox product development.”
“What I love about Firefox is that it really provides users with an alternative choice of a browser that is just genuinely designed for them,” she said. “We have, from its very inception and throughout, really wanted to create a browser that prioritizes people over profit, prioritizes privacy over anything else, and to have that option, the choice.”
“I’ve been in enough places where people tend to forget about the core business, and they stop investing in it, because they get distracted by shiny things — and then they regret it,” said Chambers, who previously held executive roles at PayPal, Skype, Airbnb, and Willow Innovations. “I’m very determined that that’s not what we’re going to do here. Firefox is incredibly important, and it is our core. We’ve actually put more investment into it this year and into connecting with our communities, into bringing out and testing features that are positive and creating good experiences for folks. That’s been a huge priority for me and for the company this year, and it’s showing up in the results.”
She acknowledged that Mozilla doesn’t have the device distribution that benefits many of Firefox’s competitors, especially on mobile, but she did note that the Digital Marks Act (DMA) in Europe — which means Apple, for example, has to provide a browser choice screen on iOS — is working.
“With the DMA, even though the implementation hasn’t been outstanding, we’re seeing a real shift. When people have the choice to choose Firefox, they’re choosing Firefox,” she said.  “So on mobile, there’s some good, promising things happening there, because we know, once people get to choose Firefox, they choose us. Because the features are great, the product is great.”
To kick-start some of this growth, Mozilla is looking at reaching new, and younger, users. Chambers noted that Mozilla is running a number of marketing campaigns to make people aware of Firefox, especially those who are only now starting to make their first browser choices.
With them, she believes, Mozilla’s messaging around privacy lands especially well. “Privacy is still resonating, right? It always does. Like, if you ask people if they care about privacy, they always say, yes. Now, do they take actions consistent with it? Not always, but the privacy messaging, people get that and appreciate it,” she said.
Of course, she said, the browser also has to work very well — and that’s something Mozilla has focused on quite extensively in recent years. And at the same time, the team also has to keep innovating and giving users the features they are looking for. She noted that as part of refocusing on Firefox, Mozilla is running far more user experience experiments in the browser now, for example.
Mozilla is also thinking about how AI will change how people browse the web. There, the organization is mostly looking at giving people choice. It’s starting to build some smaller models into the browser already, mostly around translation, but with Firefox 130, it also introduced a model that automatically adds alt text for PDF images, for example. For all of this work with AI models, Mozilla plans to follow the Open Source Initiative’s guidance for what constitutes an open source model.
“I think the browser can play a really, really powerful role here — a browser that is designed for your choice and that is designed for your privacy could play a very key role, I think, in the future of Gen AI, especially in a world where there’s models taking actions on your behalf,” she said. “How do you have transparency into what they’re doing and how they’re making those choices? How do you have a good experience around that? We’re really trying to very much center our thinking around what will the experience be of folks using AI in the future.”
She does think, however, that it will still take two to three years before we’ll really see AI have a strong influence on how people will use their browser.
From a financial perspective, Mozilla is almost completely dependent on its search deal with Google. Since the Department of Justice is now looking at these deals, though mostly because of Google’s deal with Apple, there is a risk that this may also end up hurting Mozilla. Chambers didn’t seem too concerned about this, however. She noted that the scope of this ruling, which is expected soon, is the U.S., while Mozilla is a global organization.
“When you spend a second to think about what the Department of Justice is trying to do here, they’re trying to increase competition, right? The reality is that Mozilla is one of the most powerful elements of competition in this market,” she said. “We actually have our own browser engine. We actually have an alternative technology. We’re actually one of those very rare technologies [where] we’re sort of a Big Tech company, but we’re doing good stuff on the internet, so our incentives are actually really aligned in this work. And so you’ve got to imagine that as they’re weighing their rulings and considerations, it would not at all be in their best interest to put Mozilla in a bad situation, because that would decrease competition, which is the whole point of the regulation.”
One could argue that this puts more trust into the regulatory bodies than they deserve, but Chambers also noted that the team has worked on scenario planning. Mozilla has tried to diversify its revenue, but at the end of the day, it’s Firefox that is keeping the organization afloat.
There can be no doubt, though, that the web would look quite different without Firefox and without Mozilla’s advocacy for an open web ecosystem. And while Mozilla itself may be working through its own problems, now is as good a time as ever to see if Firefox may just be the right browser for you (again)."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/09/boox-palma-2-a-great-little-e-reader-with-bigger-ambitions/,Boox Palma 2: A great little e-reader with bigger ambitions | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-09,"The Palma is a strange product. It’s a small e-reader with far bigger gadget ambitions. On its site, Boox describes the product as a “distraction-free device that lets you reclaim your focus in the exact middle between tech and life.”
In a lot of ways, the company’s ambitions appear to mirror those of Light Phone’s by building a secondary device designed to remove you from your smartphone’s built-in distractions. That’s a nice enough sentiment many of us can no doubt get behind, having experienced yet another deeply polarizing U.S. presidential election through the lens of social media.
What, precisely, constitutes a “distraction” versus an essential function is extremely subjective, however. Turning back to Light Phone for a second, we see a product that was intentionally launched with a limited feature set, only to subsequently introduce new functionality that was initially deemed “nonessential” by the startup.
For better or worse, we rely on our little pocket communicators for nearly every aspect of our lives. Reducing dependence and distraction are valiant goals, but depriving users of genuinely helpful features can be counterproductive.
The Palma doesn’t start from that same place of functional minimalism — at least not fully. There are certain limitations baked directly into the product by the nature of its ePaper display. There’s certain functionality that works better on the technology — reading, for example — but it lacks a tremendous amount of versatility compared to your standard smartphone/tablet screen.
The device, however, runs Android (albeit a few generations behind) and has access to the Play Store. It has a camera, microphone, speakers, and Bluetooth connectivity. The Palma 2 features an upgraded octa-core processor and adds in privacy by way of a fingerprint reader.
The interesting choices of what to put in and what to leave out make it feel like PDA with an identity crisis: a strange consumer electronic chimera that’s not entirely sure what it wants to be when it grows up. As it turns out, that’s part of the fun.
Playing around with the Palma 2 sent me down some unexpected rabbit holes, including Reddit threads wherein people discuss ways to backdoor functionality onto the device. There is, for example, a microSD slot for expandable memory, but not one for a SIM. That means, in spite of the inclusion of microphones, speakers, and Bluetooth, it’s not specifically designed to make phone calls.
As such, people debate the viability of using WhatsApp’s voice feature as a work-around. There’s no GPS, which puts the kibosh on mapping functionality, but how about piggybacking on a device that does? It’s a lot of work for relatively little reward, but it’s always hopeful to see the ways in which technological limitations spur clever user innovation.
Granted, I’ve only been using the Palma 2 for a short time, but I tend to fall in the camp of users content to think of the device as a pure e-reader. It enjoys many of those features, including ePaper that’s far easier on the eyes (and sleep schedule) and extends battery life far beyond what the average smartphone is capable of.
The new processor adds zip to the Palma, while removing the annoying latency from the previous generation. That said, the product is still hampered by ePaper’s refresh limitations. If Boox were to make a version of the Palma that was a true e-reader, stripped of much of the potentially extraneous features, and delivered it at a lower price, I could see these things flying off the shelf.
Just the promise of a reader that’s thin enough to carry in a pocket will likely attract a lot of attention. I’ve wasted more time than I care to mention trying to decide whether to take my Kindle with me on a long train ride, knowing it would mean awkwardly carrying the device around for the rest of the evening and potentially leaving it behind in a dark corner.
Boox makes some great e-readers, and the Palma fits the bill. It’s nice hardware, with a flush 300 ppi display and a solid front light for reading in bed. The $280 asking price, on the other hand, is hard to justify unless you plan to utilize most of the other features."

It’s not all bad news, however. Turns out there are still plenty of robotics firms hiring. If you’ve recently lost your job, just graduated, or are simply looking around, there’s probably a good fit in here somewhere."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/09/productivity-hacks-are-overrated-says-a16z-vc-who-sold-his-own-startup-for-1-25b/,"Productivity hacks are overrated, says a16z VC who sold his own startup for $1.25B | TechCrunch",Julie Bort,2024-11-09,"What’s the secret to startup success? Not the trends that so many Silicon Valley founders subscribe to, Andreessen Horowitz general partner VC Martin Casado said to a standing-room-only crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt last week.
Before joining the storied VC firm, Casado founded two other companies, including Nicira, a networking infrastructure company he sold to VMware for $1.25 billion. When asked for advice about achieving success, he warned founders to beware of “hustle culture” trends.
“Silicon Valley is so performative, right? There’s a lot of ‘doing startups’ and doing ‘the right stuff’ and being part of the culture club and doing networking,” he said. “It’s good to hear about all the hustle, crazy stuff. And feel free to go ahead and think about that. But if you’re doing a startup, you should really, really focus on your mental well-being.”
For instance, he hears a lot of founders “focusing on how they can be as productive as possible in a given day,” he said. They script their days: wake up at 5, eat certain foods, work out, and “fast during so-and-so times,” he describes.
Beyond that there are productivity hacks like “Eat the Frog,” doing your most disliked task first thing every morning; the Pomodoro Technique, working in 25-minute chunks with 5-minute breaks; and countless other trends.
“I don’t think any of that really had a serious impact. I think the most important thing is just to do the thing,” Casado advises.
Instead of filling a day with rigidity, “startups are so hard, and you as a founder, are so traumatized that I actually think you need to kind of do the opposite … just focus on staying sane and taking care of yourself.”
That might mean “sleeping in and eating fast food,” he says. Founders need to understand that it will likely take years to achieve success, and there’s no guarantee that they ever will. Lifestyle hacks that may work to hit an approaching deadline might not be sustainable as a way of life for years.
“Things always take way longer than you expect. And I think the people that actually just focus on their well-being are the ones that survive,” he said. “If you can survive, at the end of the day, you’ll have a shot at winning.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/09/vcs-on-how-to-survive-and-thrive-after-a-down-round/,VCs on how to 'survive and thrive' after a down round | TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,2024-11-09,"Founders hope that their startups continually raise larger funding rounds at escalating valuations. But unexpected challenges, such as a global health crisis or a sudden surge in interest rates, can have a significant impact on a company’s ability to maintain its valuations.
Some of these startups may have to resort to down rounds, which are new financings at a lower valuation than the company’s previous price. While founders and investors generally try hard to avoid down rounds, contrary to popular belief, these deals don’t necessarily have a devastating impact on a startup’s future.
“Our first investment, when we started our firm in 2021, was a down round recap of a company that had to have a total pivot during COVID,” Nikhil Basu Trivedi, co-founder of Footwork, said onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. “Their initial business was in the college housing market, which got decimated the moment the pandemic hit.”
Footwork reset the company’s cap table and created a new stock option pool for the entire team, said Basu Trivedi, adding that the company’s new business, a subscription platform for restaurants called Table22, “managed to survive and thrive from that experience.” Last week, Table22 announced an $11 million Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners.
Although, by far not all companies that have to take a down round have a complete revival. Elliott Robinson, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, said onstage that if a company is struggling, “there’s a pretty good likelihood that someone else in your space or a competitor is dealing with many of the same challenges.”
Robinson encouraged startups in those positions to stay the course. “If you’ve taken a down round, that’s okay,” he said. “In a tough market environment, that can actually be a win. You might not see it or feel it until four or six quarters out, but a lot of the time the market can open up to you if you want to stick with it.”
Prominent companies that took valuation hits include Ramp, which was valued at $5.8 billion last year, a 28% haircut from its previous $8.1 billion price. The fintech gained some of its value back this April when Khosla Ventures priced it at $7.65 billion.
Down rounds weren’t very common during the pandemic-era boom, but their prevalence as a percentage of all deals has more than doubled from 7.6% in 2021 to 15.7% in the first half of 2024, according to PitchBook data.
Startup prices dropped significantly after the U.S. Fed hiked interest rates, and many companies remain overvalued relative to their performance, said Dayna Grayson, co-founder at Construct Capital. Some of these companies are possibly considering down rounds, but for many of the founders, these deals are very stressful.
In a down round, employees and founders end up with a smaller ownership percentage of the company.
“I think the scariest thing for a lot of founders is how to manage morale,” Grayson said. “But you can absolutely incentivize people through down rounds.”
Robinson, who has guided three portfolio companies through flat or down rounds in the past year and a half, explained how investors motivated the employees and executives of one of these companies to remain committed after a down round. He explained that while everyone at the company experienced a loss in valuation, investors established a bonus pool to reward the entire team with cash bonuses if they could achieve a 60% revenue growth over a specific time frame. Robinson said that founders and top executives would also receive additional equity in the form of stock options if they achieved specific revenue targets.
“That allowed us to make the company-wide and executive goals very transparent,” he said, adding that it “reminded people that the core underlying business is still solid.”
The question on the minds of many venture capitalists now is what will happen with many AI companies raising capital at high valuations.
“I think it would be hard to argue there are not overinflated valuations in the market now,” Grayson said.
Basu Trivedi, who invested in several AI startups, including AI detector GPTZero, said that many AI “companies have the fundamentals to justify the hype and valuations,” but later added that it is still hard to tell which AI companies will succeed. “Some of these categories are so competitive,” he said. “There’s like 20 companies doing something really similar.”"

It should be riveting, if the prosecution’s newly wrapped case against Momeni is any indication. Per The San Francisco Standard, the case’s lead police investigator walked jurors through myriad twists and turns surrounding the two-day drug binge Lee was on with Khazar Momeni, the defendant’s sister, including an alleged sexual assault on Khazar Momeni by a drug-dealing friend of Lee, and Nima Momeni’s attack on Lee, who was stabbed three times with a kitchen knife.
Certainly, the details show Lee’s death had nothing to with homelessness in San Francisco, as was initially assumed. On the contrary, the case has so far featured many details you might see in an episode of “Law & Order,” from burner phones, to a BMW resold to a dealership, to video evidence from The Battery, a popular private social club in the city."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/openai-loses-another-lead-safety-researcher-lilian-weng/,"OpenAI loses another lead safety researcher, Lilian Weng | TechCrunch",Maxwell Zeff,2024-11-09,"Another one of OpenAI’s lead safety researchers, Lilian Weng, announced on Friday she is departing the startup. Weng served as VP of research and safety since August, and before that was the head of OpenAI’s safety systems team.
In a post on X, Weng said that “after 7 years at OpenAI, I feel ready to reset and explore something new.” Weng said her last day will be November 15 but did not specify where she will go next.
“I made the extremely difficult decision to leave OpenAI,” said Weng in the post. “Looking at what we have achieved, I’m so proud of everyone on the Safety Systems team and I have extremely high confidence that the team will continue thriving.”
Weng’s departure marks the latest in a long string of AI safety researchers, policy researchers, and other executives who have exited the company in the last year, and several have accused OpenAI of prioritizing commercial products over AI safety. Weng joins Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike — the leaders of OpenAI’s now dissolved Superalignment team, which tried to develop methods to steer superintelligent AI systems — who also left the startup this year to work on AI safety elsewhere.
Weng first joined OpenAI in 2018, according to her LinkedIn, working on the startup’s robotics team, which built a robot hand that could solve a Rubik’s cube — a task that took two years to achieve, according to her post.
As OpenAI started focusing more on the GPT paradigm, so did Weng. The researcher transitioned to help build the startup’s applied AI research team in 2021. Following the launch of GPT-4, Weng was tasked with creating a dedicated team to build safety systems for the startup in 2023. Today, OpenAI’s safety systems unit has more than 80 scientists, researchers, and policy experts, according to Weng’s post.
That’s a lot of AI safety folks, but many have raised concerns around OpenAI’s focus on safety as it tries to build increasingly powerful AI systems. Miles Brundage, a longtime policy researcher, left the startup in October and announced  that OpenAI was dissolving its AGI readiness team, which he had advised. On the same day, the New York Times profiled a former OpenAI researcher, Suchir Balaji, who said he left OpenAI because he thought the startup’s technology would bring more harm than benefit to society.
OpenAI tells TechCrunch that executives and safety researchers are working on a transition to replace Weng.
“We deeply appreciate Lilian’s contributions to breakthrough safety research and building rigorous technical safeguards,” said an OpenAI spokesperson in an emailed statement. “We are confident the Safety Systems team will continue playing a key role in ensuring our systems are safe and reliable, serving hundreds of millions of people globally.”
Other executives who have left OpenAI in recent months include CTO Mira Murati, chief research officer Bob McGrew, and research VP Barret Zoph. In August, the prominent researcher Andrej Karpathy and co-founder John Schulman also announced they’d be leaving the startup. Some of these folks, including Leike and Schulman, left to join an OpenAI competitor, Anthropic, while others have gone on to start their own ventures."

In the latest example, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Upwind — a specialist in assessing and securing cloud infrastructure — is closing in on a $100 million round at a valuation of between $850 million and $900 million, post-money.
The round includes a mix of new and existing investors such as Craft Ventures, Greylock, Cyberstarts, Leaders Fund, Omri Casspi’s Sheva Fund, and basketball star Stephen Curry’s investment fund Penny Jar. The round is in its final stages of getting closed — this could come in a matter of days — and could include further investors.
The round, a Series B, comes on the heels of the company picking up “dozens” of Fortune 500 companies and growing its staff to about 160 people, a source said.
It’s a significant leap for Upwind, which had previously raised just over $77 million, including a $50 million round in September 2023. Upwind’s last valuation, from that most recent round, was $300 million. It will be using some of the funding for R&D, and some for hiring, with plans to add around 100 people across Israel, San Francisco, and Iceland.
Upwind was founded by Amiram Shachar, who sold his previous company, the cloud spend management startup Spot.io, to NetApp for $450 million. It is part of the guard of cybersecurity startups founded in Israel by teams that cut their teeth originally working in areas like military intelligence.
In its case, it is also one of the many companies in the space focusing on vulnerabilities in the cloud through a platform approach. Specifically, Upwind aims to tackle the blizzard of alerts that are typically raised by threat detection tools. It claims to reduce these alerts by 90% to focus security operations teams more closely on understanding and responding faster to actual threats.
The company’s tech covers  cloud services (covering areas like vulnerability management and identity security), workloads (which includes container security and detection and response) and apps (including areas like API vulnerability management). To some extent, these are all interrelated, one reason a platform approach makes sense.

As this is the first election in which AI chatbots played a significant part of voters’ information diets, even approximate numbers are interesting to think about. For instance, OpenAI has stated that it told around 2 million users of ChatGPT to go look somewhere else.
It didn’t just give them a cold shoulder, but recommended some trusted news sources like Reuters and the Associated Press. ChatGPT gave this type of “I’m just an AI, go read the actual news” response over 2 million times on Election Day and the day after, OpenAI explained in an update to a blog post on its elections approach.
In the month leading up to election, ChatGPT sent around a million people to CanIVote.org when they asked questions specific to voting. And interestingly, it also rejected some 250,000 requests to generate images of the candidates over the same period.
For comparison, Perplexity, the AI search engine, made a major push to promote its own election information hub, resulting in some 4 million page views, the company claimed (per Bloomberg).
It’s difficult to say whether these numbers are low or high. Certainly they are nowhere near leaders in the news: CNN’s digital properties saw around 67 million unique visitors on Election Day and a similar amount the day after.
But traffic is a tricky metric at the best of times. What matters this year is not that CNN got 10 times the traffic as these two AI platforms put together, but that it got only 10 times the traffic. Millions of people were interested enough, and trusted AI companies enough, to at least ask or give their election knowledge a shot.
While OpenAI’s play was the safe one, and Perplexity may have pulled off a risky bet, the AI industry in general is probably ecstatic about the fact that there was no serious gaffe by any of the big brands (except xAI, of course) and that users considered these chatbots and AI-powered platforms valuable as Election Day resources.
Luckily for them, this particular election, though controversial in its own way, was relatively decisive and resulted in very few grey areas like disputed results, recounts, and lawsuits. If the 2020 election had occurred this week, they may not have fared so well.

However, Cursor has become one of the most popular. Its developer, Anysphere, has seen its revenue grow from $4 million annualized recurring revenue (ARR) in April to $4 million a month as of last month, according to a person with direct knowledge of the company’s financials. The company is experiencing faster user adoption and growth compared to other coding assistant providers, another person said.
Such fast growth has VCs flocking to it. Anysphere has received unsolicited offers valuing the company at as much as $2.5 billion from Benchmark, Index Ventures, and previous investors  Andreessen Horowitz and Thrive, among others, the person said.
Index Ventures declined to comment. Anysphere, Benchmark, Andreessen Horowitz, and Thrive didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Interest in the company has exploded so fast that last week, the unsolicited offers started at a $1.5 billion valuation, but have already risen to $2.5 billion, the person with direct knowledge of the company said. Sources also told The Information that investors are willing to price the company at $2.5 billion.
This compares to the $400 million valuation of Anysphere from just four months ago, when it raised a $60 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz and Thrive. Patrick Collison, Stripe co-founder, also joined the round.
The company was co-founded in 2022 by Michael Truell, Sualeh Asif, Arvid Lunnemark, and Aman Sanger while they were students at MIT. Last year, Anysphere graduated from OpenAI’s accelerator program and became its most prominent graduate. The company then raised an $8 million seed round led by OpenAI’s Startup Fund, with participation from former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi.
Most engineers are already using coding assistants like Cursor, and some VCs anticipate that these tools will soon allow startups to hire fewer software developers."

“Which deployment are you looking to do?” Horowitz wrote back.
“Whatever you want, Ben,” Gennaro replied, according to emails seen by TechCrunch.
Horowitz then sent money to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s (LVMPD) police foundation to purchase Skydio drones for the department.
It was a win-win, seemingly. Skydio was able to tout its relationship with the LVMPD, while the department received a new tool to fight crime. In a blog post detailing the partnership, Skydio praised the LVMPD’s choice to adopt its X10 drones as being “driven by the ambitious vision of making Las Vegas the safest community in America.”
They did not mention Horowitz, despite the fact that the VC’s relationship with the LVMPD runs deeper than just funding the Skydio drones.
The venture capitalist has facilitated communication between the LVMPD and at least six a16z portfolio companies. TechCrunch learned about this relationship after receiving over 100 emails between Horowitz and the department, as well as internal police emails about his donations primarily between January 2023 and July 2024, in a public records request.
In total, the investor has donated at least $7.6 million to fund police department purchases over the last few years, according to a post he published on a16z’s blog in mid-October after learning about TechCrunch’s receipt of the public records. He and his wife Felicia have also paid to expand and improve the LVMPD’s gym, according to the emails and his post.
Horowitz isn’t alone in this approach to supporting police. Soliciting donations to police foundations to cover the cost of specific equipment purchases is an increasingly popular and controversial approach taken by some of the largest departments around the country.
Experts and advocates on police accountability and surveillance told TechCrunch that police foundations bypass the typical procurement process that can include public meetings, a city-approved budget, and a potential bidding period to give competitors a chance.
“It’s horrifying from a good government perspective, from a nonprofit [and] ethics perspective, and just really has become such a major part of how novel police technologies are advertised and marketed,” Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, said in an interview.
Fox Cahn and others also said donations can set up companies for ongoing contracts where taxpayers foot the bill. And they say it can tilt the playing field. In Skydio’s case, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department owned products from at least three other drone companies before Horowitz’s donation, a prior public records request revealed.
Horowitz argued in his post that the public sector often has “trouble budgeting” for new strategic technology, so “by donating the technology, I am able to give LVMPD a running start.”
His approach was praised by David Ulevitch, a general partner at a16z, which backed Skydio. “What @bhorowitz and Felicia have done in Vegas is a masterclass in philanthropy and impact,” Ulevitch wrote. “I hope it catches on in cities across America as a model to bring great technology to public safety and bootstrap the process.”
TechCrunch asked Horowitz for an interview and sent a list of questions for this story, but he did not respond. Andreessen Horowitz spokesperson Grace Ellis declined to answer the questions, and said there was “nothing more for Ben to share beyond his blog post.” An unnamed representative of the LVMPD’s public information office said the department “is grateful to the private citizens who provide funding for various projects throughout the department,” and declined to answer further questions.
For Horowitz’s wife Felicia, California in 2020 was beginning to look too much like her past. The two had lived in the affluent Bay Area town of Atherton, California, for years. But Felicia had grown up outside of Los Angeles, in Compton and Carson, California, where she “saw many of her friends murdered,” Horowitz said in his blog post.
Between Prop. 47, a 2014 California policy that reclassified some felonies as misdemeanors, and politicians’ short-lived pledges to slash police budgets, Felicia felt she was watching her home state deteriorate in real time. “The new policies — defund the police, don’t prosecute crime — are destroying the communities where I grew up,” she was quoted saying in The Wall Street Journal. “If you want to genocide black people, the California policies are a great blueprint.”
Felicia wanted out of California and Horowitz was intrigued by Las Vegas. The city, he told a Substack publication, promised “the Raiders, amazing restaurants, and world class entertainment.”
Horowitz purchased his Las Vegas residence, and his business partner, Marc Andreessen, reportedly bought a $36 million vacant plot nine minutes down the road. By early 2023, the emails show Horowitz had begun making personal suggestions about products to the police department and was soon writing checks. The couple donated $800,000 for new computer terminals and $120,000 for the gym, tossing in money for new ice and cappuccino machines, he wrote in his post.
He also started connecting Vegas police with a16z portfolio companies. In addition to Skydio, he donated $400,000 for the police department to acquire technology from Prepared, an a16z company that uses AI to help with 911 calls, and an unspecified amount for surveillance cameras from Flock Safety, another a16z company. Horowitz also set up introductions for secure communications startup Kodex, and Earnin’, which helps employees access their pay before payday, the emails show.
The LVMPD didn’t just blindly accept his donated technology, though, according to the emails.
Horowitz told Gennaro in an August 2023 email that he would make a donation for the department to acquire technology from Toka, an a16z-backed cybersecurity company. But police leadership had concerns. The startup was slow to provide pricing information and there were questions about whether Toka’s technology would work well with some of LVMPD’s cameras, according to the emails.
LVMPD leadership wanted their internal business and technology governance board to review the tech before even receiving a Toka demo and warned there might be a “lengthy” clearance approval process.
While it is not clear why, a deal was never worked out: A spokesperson for Toka told TechCrunch that LVMPD “has never been a client or user of our products.”
The Skydio deal wasn’t straightforward either. Horowitz had donated the money for the LVMPD to buy Skydio drones before 2023, according to emails viewed by TechCrunch. Previously, the police force owned a handful of X2 Skydio drones, issued from 2020 to 2022, as well as drones from companies Autel, Brinc, and Skyfront, according to a previous public records request.
In a 2023 email to chief of staff Gennaro, Brad Cupp, then-Las Vegas police sergeant, reflected on the X2 Skydio drones. He wrote that they showed a “tremendous amount of promise,” but “fell short of what we needed operationally.”
In the same email, Cupp wrote that the Skydio team had listened to LVMPD’s feedback, creating a new drone that “has the potential to truly be a game changer,” he wrote. “I’m hoping you will be able to assist upgrading all or part of our fleet of Skydios.”
Gennaro forwarded the message to Horowitz, asking for help. A few months later, Skydio officially announced their new drone, the X10, and sent over a proposal to LVMPD for drones and drone docks — a landing pad for drones stationed throughout the city — in hopes that Horowitz would donate the equipment to the police force.
This potential deal took on a newfound importance after the company stopped selling consumer drones that year, betting its future on government, defense, and law enforcement. This meant all of their inventory would have to meet a higher standard: police drones usually need longer battery lives and better cameras, as well as additional technology like thermal sensors.
It was an expensive bet. According to a 2024 pitch deck prepared by Skydio investor Linse Capital that was viewed by TechCrunch, the drone company forecasted that it could burn through at least $238 million by 2029, based on factors like increased manufacturing and expansion into new industries and geographies. Linse Capital was more pessimistic about Skydio’s needs, according to the deck. It forecasted Skydio could plow through at least $348 million in the next five years on its way to profitability. A Skydio representative said that these figures are not in any Skydio pitch decks and that the firm cannot validate them. Linse Capital declined to comment.
Horowitz, however, expressed surprise at the large scope of Skydio’s proposal to the LVMPD, especially its suggestion to put docks on schools, according to the emails.
“I thought that we just wanted this for the 11 neighborhoods,” Horowitz emailed Gennaro, the “we” referring to the police department and himself, as the one footing the bill. “They bid the schools too. Is that what we asked for?”
Gennaro explained that more drones were necessary in higher-crime neighborhoods, though much of the email was redacted, including his response to putting docks on schools. Gennaro ended the email by deferring to his donor’s judgment.
“We can adjust however you see fit,” he wrote. An unnamed representative of the LVMPD’s public information office said that no drone docks have currently been installed in LVMPD’s jurisdiction.
Three months later, when Horowitz pitched Gennaro on another a16z portfolio company, Kodex, he included a caveat: “If it’s a good idea, I am happy to help, but let’s not let the company know that,” Horowitz emailed. “We don’t need another Skyd.io proposal lol.”
Stacy Wang, Kodex’s head of marketing, said the company had no knowledge of Horowitz funding the LVMPD’s acquisition of a16z portfolio companies’ products. She told TechCrunch that Kodex is “free to use” for all law enforcement agencies.
Horowitz’s increased proximity to the LVMPD has had other ripple effects for the companies he’s invested in. Around the same time that Skydio publicized its partnership with the LVMPD, Sergeant Cupp, who had evangelized the company’s drones internally, left the department for a new gig, according to his LinkedIn profile: Program manager at Skydio.
Andreessen Horowitz held its 2023 LP Summit — an event for the people who invest in the firm’s funds — in Las Vegas. The city’s sheriff, Kevin McMahill, donning his police uniform, sat onstage between Flock Safety founder Garrett Langley and a16z’s Ulevitch. McMahill couldn’t hold back his glee as he spoke about using a16z-backed technologies.
“Every piece of that technology is the equivalent of three police officers,” he said of Flock’s products, adding: “Bad guys know that when you come to Las Vegas, because of our abilities — technology being at the forefront of it — you are going to get caught.”
McMahill also touted LVMPD’s commitment to transparency during the talk. But he didn’t mention the opaque tool the department used to acquire these technologies: police foundations.
These foundations are often set up as tax-exempt nonprofits, and give private citizens and corporations a way to donate money that can be used to buy things for police departments. Their use has exploded in recent years, with police foundations in major cities like New York, Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Atlanta generating millions of dollars in annual revenue.
Evan Feeney, senior director of campaigns and organizing at Color Of Change, a nonprofit civil rights advocacy organization that has published research on police foundations, called them a “legal loophole” in an interview with TechCrunch. “Billionaires should not be allowed to buy access and influence with law enforcement,” he said.
Transparency, or lack of it, is a primary concern advocates like Feeney have with the use of police foundations.
To wit, Horowitz used his personal foundation to donate $2 million to the Las Vegas police foundation in 2023. But his foundation’s tax filing vaguely described the “purpose” of the donation as “support of police.”
The Las Vegas police foundation, meanwhile, doesn’t publish a full rundown of its donors. And while it maintains a website that lists some of the programs it funds, it does not mention the a16z companies, nor does it say how much money goes to any one effort.
What little they do disclose lags behind the real-world deployment. The most recent public filings for either foundation only cover activity through as late as June 2023.
“Welcome to the wonderful, dystopian land of Police Foundations,” Fox Cahn, the surveillance advocate, said.
Fox Cahn added that, often, the donations can set up companies for lucrative ongoing contracts with the police force, sidestepping competitors. After an initial donation, “they can then try to both sell the [police] on a follow-up contract but also then use the fact that [police] are deploying a technology for advertising,” he said.
“It becomes really just impossible for voters — for the public – to hold people accountable,” he said.
Horowitz has justified his involvement with the LVMPD by pointing to dropping crime rates in the city — which he says is happening thanks, in part, to his donations. In his post, he claimed that 911 calls are being answered faster and that, thanks to Flock Safety, 17% more suspects are being arrested.
But Horowitz did not say in the post where he got these statistics, and he declined to answer when TechCrunch asked. The LVMPD referred TechCrunch to its public crime statistics, which do not line up with Horowitz’s figures.
Sheriff McMahill is a believer. At the LP Summit, he recalled a shooting where all they knew was there were two cars with multiple weapons firing. The case seemed hopeless until he used Flock Safety technology, which includes gunshot detection and license plate recognition software, which was able to give them more information on the scene and help them to catch the shooters.
“This technology is changing the game,” McMahill declared to the crowd of a16z investors. “We are going to get to a place at some point where it becomes impossible to commit a crime.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/what-does-trumps-election-mean-for-the-tiktok-ban/,What does Trump's election mean for the TikTok ban? | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-11-08,"As TikTok stares down an impending federal ban, Donald Trump’s win in the presidential election could be a lifeline.
It’s a plot twist for the embattled, Chinese-owned social media company. During Trump’s last presidency, the president-elect had been the one to initiate the calls to ban TikTok, which only petered out because he didn’t win his first attempt at re-election in 2020. But during his 2024 campaign, Trump took a different approach. He wrote in all-caps on his platform Truth Social, “FOR ALL OF THOSE THAT WANT TO SAVE TIK TOK IN AMERICA, VOTE TRUMP!”
President Biden signed off on a bill in April that gives ByteDance, the Chinese parent company to TikTok, nine months to sell the platform. If ByteDance fails to complete a sale — which is a likely outcome — it will be banned on January 19, 2025, the day before Trump’s inauguration. However, ByteDance has the option of pursuing a 90-day extension, which would put the ball in Trump’s court.
Trump’s reasoning for his support of a TikTok ban in 2020 echoes the current bipartisan sentiment among legislators who pushed for this legislation. At the time, Trump raised concerns about the Chinese Communist Party potentially gaining access to Americans’ data (while there has not been public evidence of the CCP accessing American TikTok users’ data, there has been proof that ByteDance accessed TikTok user data). Now, the president-elect appears more concerned with how a TikTok ban would benefit Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.
“Without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,” Trump told CNBC in March.
He made similar comments on Truth Social, claiming that he doesn’t want a TikTok ban to result in Meta’s business growth, because he believes Facebook is “a true enemy of the people.”
Another reason for Trump’s changed view on TikTok could be his relationship with Jeff Yass, a billionaire GOP donor and co-founder of the trading firm Susquehanna International Group. Yass and his wife, Janine, donated over $96 million to right-leaning PACs during this election cycle — and Yass also happens to own 7% of ByteDance.
Though Trump’s win might also be a victory for TikTok, politicians’ campaign promises don’t always come to fruition."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/monarch-tractor-lays-off-10-in-restructuring-towards-software-and-licensing-av-tech/,Monarch Tractor lays off 10% in restructuring towards software and licensing AV tech | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-11-08,"Monarch Tractor has laid off around 10% of its workforce as part of a restructuring that will see it prioritize non-agricultural customers, license its autonomous technology, and boost sales of its AI-powered farm management software, TechCrunch has learned.
Around 35 employees were cut this week by the Livermore, California-based autonomous electric tractor startup that has raised a total of $220 million since it was founded in 2018. Some Monarch workers told TechCrunch they were let go without severance. It’s the second cut this year; Monarch previously laid off around 15% of its workforce in July.
CEO Praveen Penmetsa told TechCrunch in an interview the company decided to restructure after a slower-than-expected third quarter, and despite raising $133 million in July from the likes of Foxconn and agri-food tech impact firm Astanor. Penmetsa said he was uncertain if employees were let go without severance, but that the company has been trying to help out laid-off workers on a case-by-case basis.
“All of this happened pretty quickly,” Penmetsa said, referring to the recent crash of California’s vineyards, which made up a bulk of Monarch’s early customers. That development, plus an ongoing pullback in agri-tech investing, left Penmetsa and his team looking at other options.
“The industry has slowed down on acquisition of new equipment and new solutions, especially in the core farming sectors,” Penmetsa said. “But in the meantime, as a platform company, we also have some very exciting non-agriculture opportunities that started sprouting because of our success in ag.”
He said the company, which has shipped 500 tractors to date, is now focused on widening its customer base in a number of ways. It is expanding beyond agricultural customers to golf courses, solar farms, and even municipalities. It’s also putting more focus on selling its “WingspanAI” farm management software. And Monarch is in talks with other “off-road” vehicle companies to license its autonomous technology.
Penmetsa said these changes inspired the cuts which hit, among other things, some of Monarch’s engineering and operations team. He also said that Monarch is leaning more on contract-manufacturer Foxconn, which builds the tractors at its Lordstown, Ohio facility, for operational roles.
“We are a startup,” Penmetsa said. “You have to be agile, right?”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/startup-land-wasnt-as-quiet-this-week-as-you-mightve-expected/,Startup land wasn't as quiet this week as you might've expected | TechCrunch,Anna Heim,2024-11-08,"Welcome to Startups Weekly — your weekly recap of everything you can’t miss from the world of startups. Want it in your inbox every Friday? Sign up here!
This week probably wasn’t the best one to make any type of big announcement. But when it comes to startups, there are quite a few contrarians, leaving us with some interesting stories to report on, despite the U.S. election news cycle.
Some election news — and non-news — on our menu this week, but also an M&A and a shutdown. In other words, business as usual.
AI night: Perplexity was arguably the other election night winner. While most AI labs sat this election out, and Grok appeared to struggle, Aravind Srinivas’ AI startup provided reliable insights and maps through its election information hub.
No big change in the weather: Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency doesn’t necessarily spell the end of the Inflation Reduction Act. Startups have broadly benefited from this climate-focused legislation, either directly or indirectly through its effects on investment and customer demand.
Bowing out: Agtech startup Bowery Farming, once a unicorn after raising more than $700 million, is ceasing operations, according to PitchBook. The New York-based vertical farm company conducted multiple rounds of layoffs in 2023.
Fresh ink: Veteran Latvian on-demand printing companies Printful and Printify are merging. They will eventually adopt a new company that hasn’t been disclosed yet; deal terms weren’t disclosed, either.
While deal count and dollar volume were lower than usual, some startups braved U.S. election noise and announced fresh funding rounds this week.
Car race: Chinese autonomous driving technology startup DeepRoute.ai raised $100 million from Great Wall Motor. The startup hopes to quickly roll out its automated driving systems before Tesla takes advantage of the pathway China opened for Full-Service Driving (FSD).
Keys in hand: MoradaUno, a Mexico City-based startup that simplifies the apartment rental process, raised a $5.6 million Series A round co-led by Cometa and Flourish Ventures.
Zero to one: Dash0, a Datadog challenger founded by former Instana CEO Mirko Novakovic and teammates, raised a $9.5 million seed funding round led by Accel, with participation from Dig Ventures, the investment firm of MulesSoft founder Ross Mason.
Fresh air: Transaera raised $8.2 million in seed funding for its dehumidification solution using a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS). The capital will help the company make more DOAS pilot units and install them on commercial buildings.
Leaving the underworld: Robotics startup Ulysses emerged from stealth and announced a $2 million pre-seed funding round led by Lowercarbon Capital. The startup is using autonomous underwater robots to plant seagrass on the ocean floor.
Crossover: Coatue Management is raising $1 billion for future investments in AI-focused companies, according to Bloomberg. The hedge fund invested in more than 170 VC-backed companies in 2021 before slowing down its pace, but it hasn’t stopped backing startups.
Faber closes: Lisbon-based VC firm Faber made a €31 million first close of its third fund, for which it aims to raise €60 million (about $64.2 million) to invest in pre-seed and seed-stage startups in Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands, with a focus on deep tech, AI, robotics, and biotech.
We already knew that fundraising in the post-ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) era was hard. Now we are also finding out that there’s no magic revenue number to unlock a Series A round. As Greylock partner Corinne Riley said onstage at Disrupt, there’s no set milestone that VCs will request: “What we’re looking for is actually the quality of the ARR [annual recurring revenue], and not the quantity of ARR.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/supersonic-aircraft-startup-exosonic-is-shutting-down/,Supersonic aircraft startup Exosonic is shutting down | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-11-08,"Exosonic, a startup developing supersonic commercial air travel and UAV tech, is winding down after five years of operation.
In an update posted to its website, Exosonic said it was unable to find the traction necessary to continue operations.
“Although the founders and team still believe in the need/desire for quiet supersonic flight and supersonic drones for the US Department of Defense, without further customer support for either concept, the company cannot sustain the cash needs to make further advancements,” the update says.
Exosonic was founded in 2019 by Norris Tie, a propulsion engineer who cut his teeth at primes like Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin; at the latter company, he reportedly worked on the low-boom X-59 aircraft for NASA. Exosonic joined Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 cohort and went on to raise over $4.5 million from venture investors, including Soma Capital, Psion Capital, and Stellar Solutions. The startup also bagged several small grants from the U.S. Air Force under its Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.
The company was making progress: It hit a major milestone earlier this year when it flew its first aircraft, a subscale variant of its supersonic UAV called EX-3M Trident, in a test flight in California. It also had two other vehicles under development: a supersonic airliner called Horizon and a larger UAV called Revenant.
When asked about what Exosonic accomplishment he was most proud of, Tie said, “I’m frankly just proud of taking a childhood dream and building a company around it. I’ve been able to learn so much and meet great people along the way. From a company accomplishment standpoint, definitely flying our EX-3M Trident is the one the team is most proud of. We took an original supersonic aircraft design and flew it (albeit subscale and subsonic), but we did that in roughly <2 years with limited capital.”
It sounds like the company was ultimately unable to bridge what’s often referred to in defense tech as “the valley of death” — the period between R&D and commercialization. This is a well-known problem for vendors looking to sell to the Department of Defense, and a place where venture capitalists have said they could step in — unless they don’t. As Exosonic put it on LinkedIn, “Without further government support for its near-term supersonic UAV development, Exosonic can no longer sustain the capital required to further advance the concept.”
Tie confirmed that the company has received some interest for potential IP purchases.
The story has been updated with Tie’s comment."

As one of Trump’s top campaign donors, Musk has forged a strong alliance with the incoming president. The Tesla CEO has been rumored as a candidate for a position in Trump’s cabinet, and his involvement on a key foreign policy call makes Musk’s potential appointment seem more likely.
According to the report, Zelenskyy was encouraged by how soon Trump contacted him after his victory in the presidential race. Zelenskyy echoed this sentiment on X. Trump has had a close relationship with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, but sources told Axios that the call “didn’t leave Zelenskyy with a feeling of despair.” However, it’s still unknown what actions Trump will take regarding the war between Russia and Ukraine.
As for Musk, the tech mogul reportedly told Zelenskyy that he will continue providing Starlink satellites to Ukraine; however, Musk has mocked the Ukrainian government in the past for asking for aid."

Tesla’s shares have rallied nearly 30% since Tuesday, including an increase Friday morning that pushed the company’s market cap past the $1 trillion mark.
The share spike is largely related to Musk, who launched a multimillion-dollar effort to re-elect Donald Trump that included using X, the social media platform formally known as Twitter that he owns. Musk, who also owns privately held companies like SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink, has publicly supported Trump in spite of the president-elect’s anti-EV stance and climate change skepticism.
Tesla first reached the trillion-dollar valuation club three years ago. Shares hit a high of $407 a share November 2021, but fell more than 70% over the next year. The stock, which has been volatile, began to recover in spring 2023."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/the-beatles-ai-assisted-track-now-and-then-is-nominated-for-two-grammy-awards/,The Beatles' AI-assisted track 'Now and Then' is nominated for two Grammy awards | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-11-08,"The Beatles have been nominated for two Grammy awards this year, and no, we did not accidentally fall into a time warp back to the 1960s. The Beatles’ song “Now and Then,” refined with the use of AI and released last year, is up for Record of the Year and Best Rock Performance. So, the fab four will be up against artists like Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, and Beyoncé, setting the tone for a pretty weird Grammys moment.
Though the band has been broken up for 50 years, Paul McCartney decided to use AI last year to create “the last Beatles record.” McCartney isn’t using this technology to resurrect his late bandmates, John Lennon and George Harrison, with deepfakes. Instead, McCartney took one of Lennon’s demos from 1978 and used AI to clean up the recording’s poor sound quality.
McCartney took inspiration from the filmmaker Peter Jackson’s “The Beatles: Get Back,” the 2021 documentary series based on archival footage of recording sessions for “Let It Be.” These recordings from 1969 didn’t sound very good, but the film’s dialogue editor Emile de la Rey used AI to recognize each of the Beatles’ voices and isolate them from background noise. This same technology helped producer Giles Martin make a new stereo mix for the Beatles’ 1966 album “Revolver.”
This AI-based audio editing is similar to how video chat platforms like FaceTime, Google Meet, or Zoom might filter out background noise from a call. Machine learning models can be trained on something specific — whether that’s a human voice on a video call, or a specific kind of guitar in a studio — and learn to isolate those sounds from the rest of a recording.
Can fellow nominees like Billie Eilish and Kendrick Lamar stand a chance against the Beatles at the Grammys? Maybe the real question is if the Beatles can win solely based on novelty — of all songs nominated for Record of the Year, “Now and Then” has the fewest Spotify streams at 78 million. If the Beatles are “more popular than Jesus,” then so is Charli XCX now, too."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/how-ai-startup-conflixis-is-protecting-hospitals-from-corrupt-doctors/,How AI startup Conflixis is protecting hospitals from corrupt doctors  | TechCrunch,Julie Bort,2024-11-08,"After a career as an incident investigator with risk management firms like Kroll and FTI Consulting, Aaron Narva (pictured above) was working with a big international bank client at compliance software maker Exiger. He was responsible for monitoring that client’s legal compliance after it had made headlines a decade earlier for a money-laundering scandal.
“While I was at Exiger, we acquired some software businesses, including an AI software tool that helped pull risk out of unstructured public records. And we built a tool to help identify corruption and sanctions risk in business relationships for very large companies,” Narva told TechCrunch.
That work gave him the idea for Conflixis. Hospitals and other big medical practices face similar risks from corruption as banks. Drug companies and device manufacturers get so famously chummy with doctors that doctors are required to disclose conflicts of interest: junkets, consulting fees, sponsorship of research grants and the like.
Much research shows that those who get too chummy are more likely to prescribe those drugs and devices, whether they would produce better outcomes for the patient or not. The risk is so great that the government runs a database called OpenPaymentsData.com, where anyone can see conflict-of-interest disclosures.
Yet disclosing such conflicts doesn’t stop the problem, which puts hospitals at legal risk. A host of laws prohibit such behavior by doctors, everything from the Stark Law, to the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS).
At the same time, commercial interests do need to work with physicians — the medical experts — to help them research new drugs and build devices. So not every interaction is forbidden.
Narva envisioned an AI-powered software as a service that would identify for hospitals and big medical practices the actual situations that put the hospital — if not the patient — at risk.
“A big health system might have 200,000 relationships between its doctors and vendors and suppliers,” Narva said. “Which of those 200,000 relationships is impacting you from any one of like six risks?”
Risks range from running afoul of laws to unfavorable medical outcomes. The federal government also provides a database that publishes hospital quality-of-care information.
Narva called a friend he’d known since the eighth grade, Joseph Bergen, director of engineering at BuzzFeed at the time, to ask Bergen’s opinion of the idea. Bergen liked it so much, he quit his job and became a co-founder.
Conflixis works by ingesting data from OpenPaymentsData.com, the hospital’s procurement data, claims data, patient outcome records, conflict-of-interest forms, and other sources. It analyzes all conflict points to identify the ones that a hospital should investigate.
“OK, we looked at all 5,000 or 10,000 relationships [and] here are the seven that you need to actually look at,” Narva describes as an example. “Like, we boiled the ocean and here are the seven.”
Conflixis takes it a step further and can also predict a hospital’s spending and suggest ways to reduce it. For instance, is the hospital buying a more expensive piece of equipment based on a recommendation from a doctor that has a relationship with that vendor, instead of a less expensive one?
“We can make it so that hospitals are reducing their regulatory risk significantly, increasing their trust and transparency with their patients, yes, but also making better operational decisions about what they’re buying,” he says.
Founded in 2023, the company already has a handful of clients, with less than $5 million in revenue, Narva said. It just announced a $4.2 million seed round co-led by Lerer Hippeau (the fund founded by BuzzFeed’s former chairman Kenneth Lerer) and Origin Ventures, with mark vc, Springtime Ventures, and pre-seed investor Cretiv Capital participating.
Conflixis joins a crowded field of health industry compliance software companies like Compliatric and Symplr, alhough some are more focused on protecting patient data than on corruption and procurement.
Narva says what sets Conflixis apart is the way it has married its employees’ careers in investigative work with LLMs. It modified off-the-shelf models to look for patterns in the data based on “our backgrounds in transaction monitoring and corruption in big data investigations,” he says.

For startups building an AI product in this space, it’s a really good time, but they aren’t without their challenges — the tech is still early, and though many companies are interested in trying generative AI solutions, they have been slow to adopt it.
There are numerous reasons why, but what appears to be foremost is the fear of AI hallucinations. “You can’t use [AI] in production for large enterprises if it lies,” said Pavitar Singh, co-founder and CEO of UnifyApps.
Singh feels his startup has a good solution for that: UnifyApps essentially connects a company’s SaaS apps and data to each other, and lets companies build and deploy their own AI chatbots on top to interface with all the information. This approach, he says, serves to minimize AI hallucinations, because UnifyApps’ agents can essentially vet each other’s output based on the company’s data.
UnifyApps is new to an already crowded space — bigwigs like Workato and Zapier already offer similar “unification” services, as do a slew of other startups. But Singh believes his startup’s AI-focused approach gives it an edge because it bakes in the ability to build AI chatbots. “Enterprises can build any number of agents: They can help HR, sales, marketing, legal, or finance,” he said.
Companies may be hesitant to adopt generative AI, but UnifyApps has already attracted more than 20 customers, including one of the largest banks in the world and a big telecom provider, Singh said.
Good traction is a great look for a young startup, and investors seem to agree. The company just raised a $20 million Series A funding round from ICONIQ Growth, less than six months after UnifyApps closed a $11 million seed round.
Singh founded UnifyApps last year after spending more than 11 years as CTO of Sprinklr, a customer experience management platform for global brands, which went public in 2021.
While only a minority of ICONIQ Growth’s investments are in Series A startups, the firm was well acquainted with Singh. “Pavitar was the mad scientist genius that was building all the incredible products for Sprinklr,” said Matt Jacobson, a general partner at ICONIQ.
ICONIQ had invested in Sprinklr’s Series D in 2014, and Jacobson spent many years serving on the company’s board. He says he was so impressed with Singh and what he was doing at UnifyApps, that he couldn’t pass up investing in the startup.
“Stakes have gotten much higher with AI applications,” Jacobson said.
UnifyApps has 150 employees across offices in Gurgaon, Dubai, and New York.
As for why the company has such a big team, Singh said UnifyApps wants to ensure its product is flawless so that large enterprises can “adopt it safely.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/fbi-says-hackers-are-sending-fraudulent-police-data-requests-to-tech-giants-to-steal-peoples-private-information/,FBI says hackers are sending fraudulent police data requests to tech giants to steal people's private information | TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,2024-11-08,"The FBI is warning that hackers are obtaining private user information — including emails and phone numbers — from U.S.-based tech companies by compromising government and police email addresses to submit “emergency” data requests.
The FBI’s public notice filed this week is a rare admission from the federal government about the threat from fraudulent emergency data requests, a legal process designed to help police and federal authorities obtain information from companies to respond to immediate threats affecting someone’s life or property. The abuse of emergency data requests is not new, and has been widely reported in recent years. Now, the FBI warns that it saw an “uptick” around August in criminal posts online advertising access to or conducting fraudulent emergency data requests, and that it was going public for awareness.
“Cyber-criminals are likely gaining access to compromised US and foreign government email addresses and using them to conduct fraudulent emergency data requests to US based companies, exposing the personal information of customers to further use for criminal purposes,” reads the FBI’s advisory.
Police and law enforcement in the U.S. generally need some kind of legal justification to seek and obtain access to private data that companies store on their servers. Typically for a person’s private content, like their files, emails, or messages, police need to provide enough evidence of a possible crime before a U.S. court will issue a search warrant allowing the police to request that information from a private company. Police can issue subpoenas — which don’t require going to a court — requesting companies to access limited amounts of information about a user, such as their basic account information, like their username, account logins, email addresses, and phone numbers, and sometimes their approximate location.
There are also emergency requests, a procedure in which law enforcement can urgently seek a person’s information from a company in the event of an immediate risk, where there is no time to seek a court order.
It’s these emergency requests that federal authorities say some cybercriminals are abusing.
The FBI said in its advisory that it had seen several public posts made by known cybercriminals over 2023 and 2024, claiming access to email addresses used by U.S. law enforcement and some foreign governments. The FBI says this access was ultimately used to send fraudulent subpoenas and other legal demands to U.S. companies seeking private user data stored on their systems.
The advisory said that the cybercriminals were successful in masquerading as law enforcement by using compromised police accounts to send emails to companies requesting user data. In some cases, the requests cited false threats, like claims of human trafficking and, in one case, that an individual would “suffer greatly or die” unless the company in question returns the requested information.
The FBI said the compromised access to law enforcement accounts allowed the hackers to generate legitimate-looking subpoenas that resulted in companies turning over usernames, emails, phone numbers, and other private information about their users. But not all fraudulent attempts to file emergency data requests were successful, the FBI said.
Cybercriminals often use the requested data for harassment, doxing, and targeting individuals with financial fraud schemes, according to a Bloomberg report from 2022, which found at the time that hackers had obtained user information from customers of Apple, and Facebook and Instagram-owner Meta, by filing fraudulent emergency data requests. Snap, the maker of Snapchat, and Discord were also reportedly targeted.
Apple, Google, Meta, and Snap, which store huge amounts of customers’ personal and private data, collectively receive tens of thousands of emergency data requests every year.
Bloomberg reported in 2022 that some of the fraudulent emergency data requests date as far back as early 2021, and were carried out by groups of mostly teenagers and young adults, such as Recursion Team, and later, Lapsus$, which went on to hack into some of the world’s largest companies, including Uber.
The FBI said in its advisory that law enforcement organizations should take steps to improve their cybersecurity posture to prevent intrusions, including stronger passwords and multi-factor authentication. The FBI said that private companies “should apply critical thinking to any emergency data requests received,” given that cybercriminals “understand the need for exigency.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/large-funds-are-too-invested-in-the-energy-transition-to-turn-back-now/,Large funds are too invested in the energy transition to turn back now | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-08,"The results of the U.S. presidential election have left many worried about the future of climate tech, but the energy transition has enough financial momentum that experts aren’t expecting investment trends to change anytime soon. Limited partners like pension funds and endowments have committed $892 billion over the last decade to the energy transition, according to PitchBook. That’s 80% of all capital committed in the sector.
For some LPs, the investments come at the behest of beneficiaries, who are hoping their money will be put to work tackling climate change. For others, “it is simply good risk management and opportunity analysis,” Pitchbook writes in its note. Whatever the case, the magnitude and durability of these investments over the past decade suggests that some of the largest investors in the U.S. are still expecting climate friendly technologies — many being commercialized by startups today — to deliver outsize returns in the coming years."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/former-raya-dispo-exec-has-a-new-fund-for-the-biggest-out-of-favor-tech-consumer/,"Former Raya, Dispo exec has a new fund for the biggest out-of-favor tech: consumer | TechCrunch",Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-11-08,"The idea of one day becoming a venture capitalist always loomed in the back of TJ Taylor’s mind.
After all, he had an extensive tech background. He co-founded a stock app and worked in community at the dating app Raya and the photo-sharing app Dispo. After leaving Dispo at the end of 2022 he found himself in a new situation. “It was the first time I didn’t know what was next,” he told TechCrunch.
He wandered a bit, launching a startup consultancy where he said he loved working with early-staged teams. “A few people from my network just point-blank said to me, ‘Why don’t you think about starting your own small fund?’” he recalled. “I was like, ‘I don’t even know where to start.’”
So he became a scout at Headline, finding his footing in an industry that, at the time, was going through a historic downturn. Headline focused a lot on Series A and up, yet Taylor always found himself trying to pass along early-stage deals. When Headline would pass he would send it out to his own network until he realized well, his friends were right — he should just launch his own fund.
So he established Hobart Ventures, named after one of the streets Taylor grew up on in South Central Los Angeles. He started working on it last December and publicly launched it a few days ago with some LPs already in tow. The firm is raising an $8 million fund dedicated to early-stage consumer startups. He hasn’t invested from the fund yet though says he has some startups to which he’s eager to cut checks. The average check size will be between $150,000 and $300,000, he said.
His focus on consumer is a natural fit given his background. Consumer startups can be a hit or miss with investors. Some are quite bullish on the category while others sigh at its mention. Still, as Taylor pointed out, consumer is a very big category: Carta data found that consumer tech raised 7.1% of all venture funding last year, a slight dip from the years before but more than hardware, energy, and crypto.
“As technology changes, macroeconomic climate changes, behavioral shifts happen, generational shifts happen. That presents opportunity, right?” he said, noting that society is going through a shift right now. “Consumer spending is still hot, right? Consumers are still spending money. Consumers will always find a way to spend money.”
He says fundraising the fund hasn’t been too difficult, though notices investors are still not back to the free-flowing days of the ZIRP era. But he’s optimistic about the future of the industry, especially if the IPO market opens back up again and LPs can start getting profits, returns, and ready to reinvest. “I think obviously with interest rates cuts coming, there will be more side-lined LPs’ money or hopefully some distribution back to LPs to make investments in funds and startups.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/led-by-a-founder-who-sold-a-video-startup-to-apple-panjaya-uses-deepfake-techniques-to-bite-into-video-dubbing/,"Led by a founder who sold a video startup to Apple, Panjaya uses deepfake techniques to bite into video dubbing | TechCrunch",Ingrid Lunden,2024-11-08,"There’s a big opportunity for generative AI in the world of translation, and a startup called Panjaya is taking the concept to the next level: a hyperrealistic, GenAI-based dubbing tool for videos that recreates a person’s original voice speaking the new language, with the video and the speaker’s physical movements automatically modifying to match up naturally with the new speech patterns.
After being in stealth for the last three years, the startup is unveiling BodyTalk, the first version of its product, alongside its first outside funding of $9.5 million.
Panjaya is the brainchild of Hilik Shani and Ariel Shalom, two deep learning specialists who have spent the majority of their professional lives quietly working on deep learning technology for the Israeli government and are now respectively the startup’s general manager and CTO. They hung up their G-man hats in 2021 with the startup itch, and 1.5 years ago they were joined by Guy Piekarz as CEO.
Piekarz is not a founder at Panjaya, but he is a notable name to have onboard: Back in 2013, he sold to Apple a startup that he did found. Matcha, as the startup was called, was an early, buzzy player in streaming video discovery and recommendation, and it was acquired during the very early days of Apple’s TV and streaming strategy, when these were more rumors than actual products. Matcha was bootstrapped and sold for a song: $10 million to $15 million — modest considering the significant steer Apple eventually made into streamed media.
Piekarz stayed with Apple for nearly a decade building Apple TV and then its sports vertical. Then, he was introduced to Panjaya through Viola Ventures, one of its backers (others include R-Squared Ventures, JFrog co-founder and CEO Shlomi Ben Haim, Chris Rice, Guy Schory, Ryan Floyd of Storm Ventures, Ali Behnam of Riviera Partners, and Oded Vardi.
“I had left Apple by then and was planning to do something completely different,” Piekarz said. “However, seeing a demo of the tech blew my mind, and the rest is history.”
BodyTalk is interesting for how it simultaneously brings several pieces of technology that play on different aspects of synthetic media into the frame.
It starts with audio-based translation that currently can offer translations in 29 languages. The translation is then spoken in a voice that mimics the original speaker, which in turn is set to a version of the original video where the speaker’s lips and other movements get modified to fit the new words and phrasing. All this is created automatically on videos after users upload them to the platform, which also comes with a dashboard that includes further editing tools. Future plans include an API, as well as getting closer to real-time processing. (Right now, BodyTalk is “near real-time,” taking minutes to process videos, Piekarz said.)
“We’re using best of breed where we need to,” Piekarz said of the company’s use of third-party large language models and other tools. “And we’re building our own AI models where the market doesn’t really have a solution.”
An example of that is the company’s lip syncing, he continued. “Our whole lip sync engine is homegrown by our AI research team, because we haven’t found anything that gets to that level and quality of multiple speakers, angles, and all the business use cases we want to support.”
Its focus for the moment is just on B2B; clients include JFrog and the TED media organization. The company has plans to expand further in media, specifically in areas like sports, education, marketing, healthcare, and medicine.
The resulting translation videos are very uncanny, not unlike what you get with deepfakes, although Piekarz winces at that term, which has picked up negative connotations over the years that are the exact opposite of the market the startup is targeting.
“‘Deepfake’ is not something that we’re interested in,” he said. “We’re looking to avoid that whole name.” Instead, he said, think of Panjaya as part of the “deep real category.”
By aiming just for the B2B market, and controlling who gets to access its tools, the company is creating “guardrails” around the technology to protect from misuse, he added. He also thinks that longer term there will be more tools built, including watermarking, to help detect when any videos have been modified to create synthetic media, both legit and nefarious. “We definitely want to be a part of that and not allow misinformation,” he said.
There are a number of startups that compete with Panjaya in the wider area of AI-based translation for videos, including big names like Vimeo and ElevenLabs, as well as smaller players like Speechify and Synthesis. For all of them, building ways to improve how dubbing works feels a little like swimming against a strong tide. That is because captions have become a very standard part of how video is consumed these days.
On TV, it’s for a litany of reasons like poor speakers, background noise in our busy lives, mumbling actors, limited production budgets, and more sound effects. CBS found in a poll of American TV viewers that more than half of them kept subtitles on “some (21%) or all (34%) of the time.”
But some love captions just because they are entertaining to read, and there’s been a whole cult built around that.
On social media and other apps, subtitles are simply baked into the experience. TikTok, as one example, started in November 2023 to turn on captioning by default on all videos.
All the same, there remains a huge market internationally for dubbed content, and even if English is often thought of as the lingua franca of the internet, there is evidence from research groups like CSA that content delivered in native languages gets better engagement, especially in the B2B context. Panjaya’s pitch is that more natural native-language content could do even better.
Some of its customers appear to support that theory. TED says that Talks dubbed using Panjaya’s tooling have seen increased views of 115%, with completion rates doubling for those translated videos.

Block is also shutting down TBD, a Bitcoin-focused arm of the business that previously set out to build a decentralized internet, dubbed “Web5.” These cuts will free up the company to invest in Bitcoin mining and its crypto wallet.
“We are scaling back our investment in TIDAL and winding down TBD,” said Block in the letter. “This gives us room to invest in our bitcoin mining initiative, which has strong product market fit and a healthy pipeline of demand, and Bitkey, our self-custody wallet for bitcoin.”
These are the latest cost-cutting efforts at the company behind Square and Cash App. Block laid off staffers in recent weeks, according to Fortune, and apparently told employees not to discuss their board member, Jay-Z, in emails or Slack messages."

According to The Information, Amazon is in talks to invest multiple billions in Anthropic, its first financial pledge in the company since a $4 billion deal struck last year. The new investment is structured similar to the last one — but with a twist. Amazon wants Anthropic to use Amazon-developed silicon hosted on Amazon Web Services to train its AI.
Anthropic prefers Nvidia chips. But the money may be too good to pass up. Around the start of the year, Anthropic reportedly projected it would burn through over $2.7 billion in 2024 as it trained and scaled up its AI products. Anthropic has for several months been discussing new funding at a $40 billion valuation, per The Information, and no doubt the pressure is on to clinch something soon.

In the company’s earnings report on Thursday, Yelp revealed that it agreed to buy RepairPal, a site for car repair estimates, for $80 million in cash. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to customary closing conditions.
“We believe RepairPal will accelerate our broader services efforts by expanding our offerings in the multi-billion dollar U.S. auto services advertising vertical,” Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s co-founder and CEO, said in a statement.
While it might not seem like an obvious marriage, RepairPal fits into Yelp’s ambition to become a major home services funnel.
In recent years, Yelp has added functionality beyond restaurant and business search tools, like an AI-powered feature that suggests plumbers, repairmen, and other home service providers to users potentially in need of them. Yelp has also introduced programs like Yelp Guaranteed, which offers up to $2,500 of coverage for qualifying projects in case of problems.
Yelp makes money through fees it receives from service providers for certain leads — and through ads. In the company’s most recent fiscal quarter (Q3 2024), advertising revenue from services businesses increased 11% year-over-year to a record $228 million, with revenue growth of around 15% in the home services category alone.
In its shareholder letter, Yelp says that RepairPal generated approximately $30 million in revenue and was roughly break-even on cash and net income.
“We believe there are clear synergies between Yelp and RepairPal,” the letter reads. “RepairPal brings deep knowledge of auto repairs and pricing, which we can leverage to improve our offerings for auto services businesses. They also maintain a robust partner network, including CarMax, USAA, and Endurance Vehicle Services. Meanwhile, Yelp has a large consumer audience and expertise in areas like search engine optimization, search engine marketing, and AI, which we believe will provide value to RepairPal going forward.”
The acquisition is a nice exit for San Francisco-based RepairPal, which managed to raise $21.3 million in funding from Cars.com, Tugboat Ventures, and others in the 17 years since the company’s founding. In its press release, Yelp didn’t say whether founders Aaron Tavistock, David Esser, and David Sturtz will be joining Yelp corporate.
A Yelp spokesperson later confirmed to TechCrunch that all RepairPal employees, including the leadership (but not the founders, who no longer head the company), will be joining Yelp."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/with-this-latest-deal-flipboard-looks-to-build-a-news-ecosystem-beyond-x/,"With this latest deal, Flipboard looks to build a news ecosystem beyond X | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-11-07,"An effort to bring a broader news ecosystem to the open social web, also known as the fediverse, is now in the hands of the social magazine app Flipboard. Press.coop, a service that created mirrored accounts of top news publishers (including Reuters, AP, WSJ, NYT, BBC, CNN, and even yours truly), has transferred its collection of nearly 100 accounts to Flipboard, the companies announced Thursday.
Press.coop was founded a year ago by a fediverse company, Hello.coop, headed by Dick Hardt. Like many, he wanted there to be more access to news in the fediverse, particularly the X rival Mastodon, where many top publishers had yet to set up shop as they had on Twitter/X. To address this need, Press.coop mirrored the publishers’ Twitter/X accounts, bringing their tweets to the broader open social web.
However, when Twitter changed its API rules and upped its pricing, that access was cut off. Press.coop then moved to mirror publishers’ RSS feeds instead.
Though these mirrored accounts were just bots that posted the publishers’ news to the fediverse as it hit their news feeds, many gained a following. The NPR account, for example, gained 10,000 press.coop followers. Others saw smaller followings.
While the movement of the accounts to Flipboard isn’t an official partnership or acquisition, in business terms, it serves the needs of news readers, publishers, and Flipboard alike, while freeing up Hardt to work on other things.
Flipboard has been more actively moving to become a federated app in recent months. After announcing its plans to integrate with the fediverse and ActivityPub — the protocol powering Mastodon and other federated apps — Flipboard made it possible for its users to follow Mastodon accounts from within its app, as well as follow and interact with others on the open social web and vice versa. Its creator-built news magazines, meanwhile, are now offered to users on the fediverse, expanding their reach.
Flipboard also brought its own editorial efforts to Mastodon with its 2023 launch of news “desks” designed for tracking stories in areas like tech, culture, science, and more, which weren’t automated accounts. These, too, now post regularly on Mastodon from Flipboard’s own Mastodon server, Flipboard.social.
The addition of the press.coop accounts expands on that earlier effort. By using these federated Flipboard accounts, publishers on Flipboard’s app will be able to see engagement in their Flipboard notifications. Plus, their existing Flipboard followers will be merged with the followers from the press.coop accounts, growing their reach.
Press.coop itself is shutting down Thursday, Hardt announced on the service’s website.
“We noticed that Flipboard has been providing much of the same content to the fediverse, so we’ve decided to partner with them and migrate all press.coop accounts to the correlated flipboard.com publisher account or to a flipboard.social account for those that are not on Flipboard already,” the site notes. The migration should complete by the end of the month."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/rivian-takes-revenue-hit-as-supplier-problem-persists/,Rivian takes major revenue hit as supplier problem persists | TechCrunch,Kirsten Korosec,2024-11-07,"Rivian reported Thursday revenue of $874 million in the third quarter — more than 12% lower than analysts’ estimates — as the EV startup struggled to resolve a component shortage that disrupted production of its recently overhauled flagship R1S and R1T vehicles.
Last month, Rivian lowered its annual production guidance to 47,000 to 49,000 vehicles due to the “acute” supply problem for a component within its Enduro motor, a single-motor-per-axle system used in Rivian R1 vehicles. The Enduro motor, which first debuted in vehicles in 2023, is emblematic of Rivian’s push to become more vertically integrated and less reliant on suppliers. In this case, the effort to bring design in-house has negatively affected production.
“This has been a tough quarter for us because of some of those supply chain or supply ramp challenges, and one of those suppliers in particular has limited our production quite substantially,” founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said. “And we’re working very, very hard to address that. This is one of our highest priorities in terms of the business, and we’re seeing this is really a short-term issue, but it certainly introduced challenges.”
While the supplier problem was largely responsible for its revenue hit, there was still a gap between production and delivery in the third quarter. Rivian said last month it produced 13,157 vehicles and delivered just 10,018 — a difference that suggests demand for its pricey EVs was also a factor.
The company now says it will revise its annual adjusted earnings guidance to between a $2.82 billion and $2.87 billion loss. Rivian had previously estimated an adjusted earnings loss of $2.7 billion.
Rivian’s third-quarter revenue of $874 million is 34.6% lower than the $1.33 billion it generated in the same period last year. The company said revenues from the sale of regulatory credits were $8 million for the quarter. Rivian was able to reduce operating expenses, which helped it narrow losses to $1.1 billion.
The gloomy revenue numbers, driven by lower production and deliveries, come as Rivian attempts to rein in costs, improve efficiency, and market the next generation of its flagship R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV as well as commercial vans, which are primarily sold to Amazon. Rivian said it has started production of a tri-motor variant of the R1 vehicles — a more expensive version — that could provide some capital and supply chain relief.
Rivian said it also continues to make progress on its next-generation R2 platform, a midsize SUV that Scaringe said “will be a fundamental driver of Rivian’s growth.”
Rivian announced Thursday a battery supplier partnership with LG Energy Solution (LGES) to supply batteries for the R2. Under the agreement, LGES will supply 4695 cylindrical battery cells, which will be produced at a factory in Queen Creek, Arizona.
Rivian said it expects R2 production to begin in the first half of 2026."

The Series C funding round was led by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. Fidelity, TPG, and United Therapeutics, which is also a customer, joined the round. This pushes Beta’s total funding past $1 billion. No word on the valuation.
As Rebecca Bellan noted in an article earlier this year, Beta doesn’t want to operate its own urban air taxi network. Rather, Beta has positioned itself as the OEM that will sell aircraft and charging solutions to a host of customers. The company has secured customers across defense, cargo delivery, and medical logistics — like United Therapeutics, UPS, Air New Zealand, and the U.S. Air Force — with a plan to launch in those markets by 2025.

This week I am turning to a handful of TechCrunch staff members who had their first Waymo rides while in San Francisco for Disrupt 2024. I’ve been in loads of autonomous vehicles, including driverless Waymos, so I thought it would be fun to share a first-timer’s view.
Venture reporter Dominic-Madori Davis said, “I thought I would hate the Waymo, but I didn’t. It drove like my mother. Quite cautious, very slow. I felt as safe as I could in a driverless car and frankly loved not having to chat about the weather.”
AI and enterprise reporter Kyle Wiggers said it was “nerve-wracking, especially when other cars would overtake us. Sitting shotgun, the whole experience felt unnerving. I kept expecting the worst.” I asked him if he would take another Waymo and his response was, “Yes, but warily.”
Venture editor Julie Bort went on three rides. She noted that her first ride was a bit scary because it “swerved a bit unsteadily in a tight lane next to a row of parked cars.” It also didn’t turn right on red, which caused some honking from frustrated humans. She also noted that sometimes the prices were far higher than what an Uber would charge and the drop-off spots were odd and around the corner.
“All in all, it was a fun experience, and if the car remains as affordable as other ride-shares, I would do it regularly,” Bort told me. “But, while it solved one safety issue, it introduced others.”
Reporter Amanda Silberling said: “Waymo is like a roller coaster. It’s fun because it feels a little bit dangerous, but like a roller coaster, you know that it’s been tested ad nauseam, so it’s probably fine? If I weren’t on a work trip with a corporate card, I don’t know if I could see myself using it, because in a lot of cases, it was more expensive than an Uber. I am generally surprised by how safe I felt on my Waymo rides, even though when I told my friends I was in a Waymo, they made me promise to text them when I arrived at my destination safely. It’s the same way my friends would react if I were alone on the subway after midnight.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/,"The WordPress vs. WP Engine drama, explained | TechCrunch",Ivan Mehta,2024-11-07,"This story has been updated throughout with more details as the story has developed. We will continue to do so as the case and dispute are ongoing.
The world of WordPress, one of the most popular technologies for creating and hosting websites, is going through a very heated controversy. The core issue is the fight between WordPress founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg and WP Engine, which hosts websites built on WordPress.
WordPress technology is open source and free, and it powers a huge chunk of the internet — around 40% of websites. Websites can host their own WordPress instance or use a solution provider like Automattic or WP Engine for a plug-and-play solution.
In mid-September, Mullenweg wrote a blog post calling WP Engine a “cancer to WordPress.” He criticized the host for disabling the ability for users to see and track the revision history for every post. Mullenweg believes this feature is at the “core of the user promise of protecting your data” and said that WP Engine turns it off by default to save money.
He also called out WP Engine investor Silver Lake and said they don’t contribute sufficiently to the open source project and that WP Engine’s use of the “WP” brand has confused customers into believing it is part of WordPress.
In reply, WP Engine sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mullenweg and Automattic, asking them to withdraw their comments. It also said that its use of the WordPress trademark was covered under fair use.
The company claimed that Mullenweg had said he would take a “scorched earth nuclear approach” against WP Engine unless it agreed to pay “a significant percentage of its revenues for a license to the WordPress trademark.”
In response, Automattic sent its own cease-and-desist letter to WP Engine, saying that they had breached WordPress and WooCommerce trademark usage rules.
The WordPress Foundation also changed its Trademark Policy page and called out WP Engine, alleging the hosting service has confused users.
“The abbreviation ‘WP’ is not covered by the WordPress trademarks, but please don’t use it in a way that confuses people. For example, many people think WP Engine is ‘WordPress Engine’ and officially associated with WordPress, which it’s not. They have never once even donated to the WordPress Foundation, despite making billions of revenue on top of WordPress,” the updated page reads.
Mullenweg then banned WP Engine from accessing the resources of WordPress.org. While elements like plug-ins and themes are under open source license, providers like WP Engine have to run a service to fetch them, which is not covered under the open source license.
This broke a lot of websites and prevented them from updating plug-ins and themes. It also left some of them open to security attacks. The community was not pleased with this approach of leaving small websites helpless.
In response to the incident, WP Engine said in a post that Mullenweg had misused his control of WordPress to interfere with WP Engine customers’ access to WordPress.org.
“Matt Mullenweg’s unprecedented and unwarranted action interferes with the normal operation of the entire WordPress ecosystem, impacting not just WP Engine and our customers, but all WordPress plugin developers and open source users who depend on WP Engine tools like ACF,” WP Engine said.
Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, has misused his control of WordPress to interfere with WP Engine customers’ access to https://t.co/ZpKb9q4jPh, asserting that he did so because WP Engine filed litigation against https://t.co/erlNmkIol2. This simply is not true. Our Cease &…
On September 27, WordPress.org lifted the ban temporarily, allowing WP Engine to access resources until October 1.
Mullenweg wrote a blog post clarifying that the fight is only against WP Engine over trademarks. He said Automattic has been trying to broker a trademark licensing deal for a long time, but WP Engine’s only response has been to “string us along.”
On September 30, a day before the WordPress.org deadline for the ban on WP Engine, the hosting company updated its site’s footer to clarify it is not directly affiliated with the WordPress Foundation or owns the WordPress trade.
“WP Engine is a proud member and supporter of the community of WordPress® users. The WordPress® trademark is the intellectual property of the WordPress Foundation, and the Woo® and WooCommerce® trademarks are the intellectual property of WooCommerce, Inc. Uses of the WordPress®, Woo®, and WooCommerce® names in this website are for identification purposes only and do not imply an endorsement by WordPress Foundation or WooCommerce, Inc. WP Engine is not endorsed or owned by, or affiliated with, the WordPress Foundation or WooCommerce, Inc.,” the updated description on the site read.
The company also changed its plan names from “Essential WordPress,” “Core WordPress,” and “Enterprise WordPress” to “Essential,” “Core,” and “Enterprise.”
WP Engine said in a statement that it changed these terms to moot Automattic’s claims.
“We, like the rest of the WordPress community, use the WordPress mark to describe our business. Automattic’s suggestion that WPE needs a license to do that is simply wrong, and reflects a misunderstanding of trademark law. To moot its claimed concerns, we have eliminated the few examples Automattic gave in its September 23rd letter to us,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.
On October 1, the company posted on X that it has successfully deployed its own solution for updating plug-ins and themes.
We are pleased to report that our solution has been fully deployed and regular workflow practices have been restored to our customers around the globe. We thank all our customers for their patience and support over the past week. Like so many of you, we love WordPress, and are…
On October 15, TechCrunch reported that Automattic planned to define trademarks since early this year involving “nice and not nice” lawyers, according to an internal blog post written by the company’s then chief legal officer. The post also mentioned a strategy to file more trademarks, which the foundation eventually did in July.
The WordPress community and other projects feel this could also happen to them and want clarification from Automattic, which has an exclusive license to the WordPress trademark. The community is also asking about clear guidance around how they can and can’t use “WordPress.”
The WordPress Foundation, which owns the trademark, has also filed to trademark “Managed WordPress” and “Hosted WordPress.” Developers and providers are worried that if these trademarks are granted, they could be used against them.
Developers have expressed concerns over relying on commercial open source products related to WordPress, especially when their access can go away quickly.
Open source content management system Ghost’s founder John O’Nolan also weighed in on the issue and criticized control of WordPress being with one person.
“The web needs more independent organizations, and it needs more diversity. 40% of the web and 80% of the CMS market should not be controlled by any one individual,” he said in an X post.
On October 9, web app development framework Ruby on Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson opined that Automattic is violating principals of open source software by asking WP Engine to pay 8% of its revenues.
“Automattic is completely out of line, and the potential damage to the open source world extends far beyond the WordPress. Don’t let the drama or its characters distract you from that threat,” he said in a blog post.
On the same day, Mullenweg added a new checkbox to the WordPress.org contributor login, asking people to verify that they are not associated with WP Engine in any way. This move was criticized by the contributor community. Some contributors said that they were banned from the community Slack for opposing the move.
In response, WP Engine said that its customers, agencies, users, and the community as a whole are not the company’s associates.
Like the rest of the community, we have seen a new checkbox for logins at https://t.co/ZpKb9q4jPh that has created confusion amongst the community as to whether or how they are obliged to answer the question posed next to the checkbox.We value our customers, agencies, users and…
On October 12, WordPress.org took control of ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) plug-in — which makes it easier for WordPress developers to add customized fields on the edit screen — which was maintained by WP Engine. As WP Engine lost control of the open source plug-in repository, the Silver Lake-backed company wasn’t able to update the plug-in. WordPress.org and Mullenweg said that plug-in guidelines allow the organization to take this step.
On October 28, WordPress allegedly asked organizers of WordCamp Sydney, a community event, to remove posts talking about WP Engine. Plus, Automattic also asked organizers across the world to share social media account credentials for “safe storage of future events,” according to leaked letters posted on X.
On November 7, Automattic created a new page called WP Engine Tracker to show how many websites have switched from WP Engine to another hosting provider.
On October 3, WP Engine sued Automattic and Mullenweg over abuse of power in a court in California. The hosting company also alleged that Automattic and Mullenweg didn’t keep their promises to run WordPress open source projects without any constraints and giving developers the freedom to build, run, modify, and redistribute the software.
“Matt Mullenweg’s conduct over the last ten days has exposed significant conflicts of interest and governance issues that, if left unchecked, threaten to destroy that trust. WP Engine has no choice but to pursue these claims to protect its people, agency partners, customers, and the broader WordPress community,” the company said in a statement to TechCrunch.
The lawsuit also notes alleged texts from Mullenweg about potentially hiring WP Engine CEO Heather Brunner. In a comment on Hacker News, Mullenweg said that Brunner wanted to be an executive director of WordPress.org.
In response, Automattic called this case meritless.
“I stayed up last night reading WP Engine’s Complaint, trying to find any merit anywhere to it. The whole thing is meritless, and we look forward to the federal court’s consideration of their lawsuit,” the company’s legal representative, Neal Katyal, said in a blog post.
On October 18, WP Engine filed an injunction in a California court, asking the judge to restore its access to WordPress.org. A day later, the company filed an administrative motion requesting the court to shorten the time to hear its earlier preliminary injunction.
Mullenweg and team opposed expedited hearing in a court document filed on October 21. They argued that the case is not about WP Engine’s access to WordPress, as the company already has access to “https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress” and they can choose to use it in any way.
“Rather than being about access to WordPress software, this case instead is about WordPress.org – a website owned and run by Defendant Matt Mullenweg individually, for the benefit of the community he loves,” the filing reads.
“WordPress.org is not WordPress. WordPress.org is not Automattic or the WordPress Foundation, and is not controlled by either. To the contrary, as Plaintiff itself acknowledges, WordPress.org is Mr. Mullenweg’s responsibility.”
On October 23, Judge Araceli Martinez-Olguin said the first hearing for primary injunction will take place on November 26 unless there is an opposition.
On October 30, Mullenweg and Automattic filed a motion to dismiss key accusations made by WP Engine on the basis that the company is responsible for harming itself.
“Despite its own (mis)conduct, WP Engine’s Complaint now asks this Court to compel Matt to provide various resources and support to private equity-backed WP Engine for free, in the absence of any contract, agreement, or promise to do so,” the court document read.
In reply, WP Engine filed a document citing Mullenweg’s comments on the TC Disrupt stage about how much business WP Engine lost.
On October 3, 159 Automattic employees who didn’t agree with Mullenweg’s direction of the company and WordPress overall took a severance package and left the company. Almost 80% of people who left worked in Automattic’s Ecosystem / WordPress division.
On October 8, WordPress said that Mary Hubbard, who was TikTok U.S.’s head of governance and experience, will be starting as executive director. This post was previously held by Josepha Haden Chomphosy, who was one of the 159 people leaving Automattic. A day prior to this, one of the engineers from WP Engine announced that he was joining Automattic.
On October 12, Mullenweg wrote in a post that every working Automattic employee would get 200 A12 shares as a token of gratitude. These shares are a special class for Automattic employees that they can sell after one year and don’t have an expiry date.
On October 17, Mullenweg posted another alignment offer on Automattic Slack — with just a four-hour response window — with a nine-month severance. However, if any person took the offer, they would also lose access to the WordPress.org community, Mullenweg said.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/roblox-adds-new-safety-measures-to-ban-kids-under-13-from-social-spaces/,Roblox adds safety measures to ban kids under 13 from social spaces and other experiences | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-11-07,"Throughout the years, several reports have accused Roblox, the popular gaming platform aimed at preteens, of lacking strict safety protocols for children, which exposes them to dangers such as grooming, explicit content, and violent or abusive material.
In a significant update to its safety policy, Roblox plans to keep users under the age of 13 away from unrated experiences. It’ll also prevent access to social hangouts and experiences that use free-form 2D user creation, which both pose risks, as they include options for chatting with other players, who may use inappropriate language, as well as interactive experiences where users can draw or write within the game.
The platform noted in a post to creators on Wednesday that, by default, kids aged 12 years old and younger will no longer be able to “play, search, and discover unrated experiences.” Roblox is also requiring creators to fill out a questionnaire if they want their experience to be available to kids under 13. Creators must ensure that their experience meets either “All Ages” or “9+” recommendations, which notably can still contain “mild violence, heavy unrealistic blood, and/or mild crude humor,” according to its support page. Gambling content, however, is off the table for kids under 13.
Roblox says it’ll enforce these requirements starting next year. Creators must fill out the form by December 3. The questionnaire is located in the Creator Hub under the Creations tab. Then, choose “Select an Experience” and “Audience.”
Additionally, users who are younger than 13 are banned from social hangouts, which is likely a response to ongoing concerns about safety within these experiences, which have been criticized for having significant oversight issues. Acknowledging this, one creator in the forum commented, “Kinda sad, but with the amount of … issues in some of these [social hangout] games, I totally understand this.”
Younger users are also unable to access experiences that involve free-form 2D user creation, which enables players to replicate other users’ drawings without going through Roblox moderation. This will begin to take effect on November 18.
Roblox also listed experiences that are suitable for this age group. These include role-playing experiences, where players can take on various roles — such as a teacher, police officer, or race car driver — or interact with items. Experiences that feature 3D assets approved by Roblox moderation are also allowed, so young kids can still build houses with blocks, design outfits, and short-form videos.
The new safety initiatives arrive on the heels of the platform introducing changes that require users under 13 to get parental permission to access certain chat functionalities. Players who are under 9 years old, meanwhile, need their parents’  approval to play experiences marked with a moderate content label.
Roblox is also currently testing an age-verification feature that verifies users over the age of 13 with a government-issued photo ID."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/tiktoks-latest-feature-lets-music-fans-share-to-tiktok-from-spotify-and-apple-music/,TikTok's latest feature lets music fans 'Share to TikTok' from Spotify and Apple Music | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-11-07,"TikTok on Thursday debuted a new feature that will more closely connect its app, which already influences which songs top the charts, to the streaming services where users discover and play their favorite music. With the launch of a new “Share to TikTok” feature, music fans will be able to directly share tracks from both Apple Music and Spotify to the short-form video app, including by posting to their For You feed, their Stories, or DMs (direct messages).
The shared content can include tracks, albums, playlists, and more, and will link back to the music-streaming service. This allows users to move between their preferred music app and TikTok to further engage with the content. In doing so, TikTok gains an increased ability to connect users with their favorite songs and artists. This is something it was already doing due to the nature of its app, which allows music clips to be added to users’ videos, where they end up driving TikTok trends.
With “Share to TikTok,” users will now be able to post to TikTok’s feed or Stories, and they can use the popular green screen feature to showcase the content or take advantage of Photo Mode, TikTok says. On Spotify, users can share music, podcasts, or audiobooks by tapping the “Share” button, or they can access the share icon in the bottom-right corner of the “Now Playing” screen.
A similar feature is available through Apple Music’s Share Sheet, where users will be presented with the different options to Post a Video, Post a Photo, or share the music in a Message.
Over the years, TikTok’s growing popularity drove its ability to change the music industry overall and how people discover new music. As Business Insider recently reported, songs that trend on TikTok tend to end up in the Billboard 100 or Spotify Viral 50, and 67% of the app’s users are likely to seek out music after hearing the songs on TikTok. The company’s relationship with music labels, artists, and marketers also helps to keep the app flooded with new releases.
For a time, TikTok parent company ByteDance considered taking advantage of TikTok’s power more directly by going head-to-head with Apple and Spotify with its own streaming app, TikTok Music. The app was tested in a handful of markets, but the company later decided to shut down its global efforts on this front back in September.
Instead, TikTok’s focus is on driving music fans to its app for discovery. Working toward this goal, TikTok had previously launched an “Add to Music App” feature that let TikTok users save a track they found on the app to their preferred music streaming service.
“Today’s launch of ‘Share to TikTok’ is the latest example of our ongoing commitment to support music discovery and artist promotion in partnership with music streaming services,” said Ole Obermann, TikTok’s Global Head of Music Business Development, in an announcement. “Since its launch, ‘Add To Music App’ has already been responsible for hundreds of millions of track saves and billions of streams on our partner music streaming services. ‘Share to TikTok’ takes the user experience full circle, and will be an amazing way of promoting artists and tracks to the TikTok community,” he added.
The move also may help to ease tensions with streamers, which saw TikTok as a potential new rival. Now TikTok will actively help move traffic both to and from their apps, instead of trying to steal their customers.
“We already know that creative expression is a core tenet of the TikTok user and creator experience, a tenet that is also strongly valued by our DSP [music streaming service] partners,” noted Lindsey Kelt Zikry, TikTok’s Global Product Partnerships Lead, in a statement. “Our ‘Share To TikTok’ integration enables seamless sharing of content from music streaming services to TikTok, unlocking a limitless new method of creative expression for users and creators alike, along with an ability for artists, authors, and podcasters to seamlessly connect with their audiences on TikTok.”
TikTok is not the only social destination Spotify has added in recent days. It also announced a partnership with Meta for sharing songs to Spotify from Instagram with a tap. Spotify has existing integrations with other Meta apps, as well as Snapchat, X, and others."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/mistral-launches-a-moderation-api/,Mistral launches a moderation API | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-07,"AI startup Mistral has launched a new API for content moderation.
The API, which is the same API that powers moderation in Mistral’s Le Chat chatbot platform, can be tailored to specific applications and safety standards, Mistral says. It’s powered by a fine-tuned model (Ministral 8B) trained to classify text in a range of languages, including English, French, and German, into one of nine categories: sexual, hate and discrimination, violence and threats, dangerous and criminal content, self-harm, health, financial, law, and personally identifiable information.
The moderation API can be applied to either raw or conversational text, Mistral says.
“Over the past few months, we’ve seen growing enthusiasm across the industry and research community for new AI-based moderation systems, which can help make moderation more scalable and robust across applications,” Mistral wrote in a blog post. “Our content moderation classifier leverages the most relevant policy categories for effective guardrails and introduces a pragmatic approach to model safety by addressing model-generated harms such as unqualified advice and PII.”
AI-powered moderation systems are useful in theory. But they’re also susceptible to the same biases and technical flaws that plague other AI systems.
For example, some models trained to detect toxicity see phrases in African American Vernacular English (AAVE), the informal grammar used by some Black Americans, as disproportionately “toxic.” Posts on social media about people with disabilities are also often flagged as more negative or toxic by commonly used public sentiment and toxicity detection models, studies have found.
Mistral claims that its moderation model is highly accurate — but also admits it’s a work in progress. Notably, the company didn’t compare its API’s performance to other popular moderation APIs, like Jigsaw’s Perspective API and OpenAI’s moderation API.
“We’re working with our customers to build and share scalable, lightweight, and customizable moderation tooling,” the company said, “and will continue to engage with the research community to contribute safety advancements to the broader field.”
Mistral also announced a batch API today. The company says it can reduce the cost of models served through its API by 25% by processing high-volume requests asynchronously. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and others also offer batching options for their AI APIs."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/microsoft-outlook-now-lets-you-create-personalized-ai-powered-themes/,Microsoft Outlook now lets you create personalized AI-powered themes | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-11-07,"Microsoft announced on Thursday that Outlook is getting a new feature that will allow you to use generative AI to create themes based on your personal preferences.
AI-powered themes are available to people who have a Copilot Pro consumer subscription and business accounts with Copilot enabled. They are available on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and the web.
With Themes by Copilot, you can build a theme inspired by more than 100 locations or create a theme based on your own location. You can decide if you want the theme to dynamically update every few hours, each day, weekly, or monthly.
Once you generate a theme, you can choose to view it in a realistic, oil painting, or cartoon style.
“If you’ve enabled location permissions in Outlook, the My Location theme will bring you imagery uniquely inspired by your locale, dynamically updating for you as you head out the door on a trip or vacation,” Microsoft wrote in the blog post. “Similarly, a dynamic theme based on the weather would be updated to reflect the current weather conditions where you are.”
You can access the AI-generated themes via Outlook’s Appearance Settings.
The company says the new addition will allow people to personalize the email service just as they would spruce up their desk with artwork or candles.
Although the new AI capability doesn’t offer any additional functionality, it does provide a fun way to personalize your email app. While both Microsoft and Google have been working to bring AI-powered productivity features to their email services, Gmail does not currently offer AI themes (Chrome does), which means Outlook users now have a bit more creative freedom.
Thursday’s announcement comes a day after Microsoft brought AI-powered features to Notepad and Paint. Windows Insiders are getting access to a “Rewrite” tool that will let them rephrase sentences, adjust tone, and modify the length of their content with the help of AI.
As for Paint, Windows Insiders will get access to new AI image editing tools, including a Generative fill feature that lets you make edits and additions using text prompts. A new Generative erase feature will let you remove unwanted objects from your artwork.
Microsoft is rolling out the two features in preview on Windows 11 in the U.S., France, the U.K., Canada, Italy, and Germany."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/hacker-says-they-banned-thousands-of-call-of-duty-gamers-by-abusing-anti-cheat-flaw/,Hacker says they banned ‘thousands’ of Call of Duty gamers by abusing anti-cheat flaw | TechCrunch,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-11-07,"In October, video game giant Activision said it had fixed a bug in its anti-cheat system that affected “a small number of legitimate player accounts,” who were getting banned because of the bug.
In reality, according to the hacker who found the bug and was exploiting it, they were able to ban “thousands upon thousands” of Call of Duty players, who they essentially framed as cheaters. The hacker, who goes by Vizor, spoke to TechCrunch about the exploit, and told their side of the story.
“I could have done this for years and as long as I target random players and no one famous it would have gone without notice,” said Vizor, who added that it was “funny to abuse the exploit.”
TechCrunch was introduced to Vizor by a cheat developer called Zebleer, who is familiar with the Call of Duty hacking scene. Zebleer said he had been in touch with Vizor for months, and as such had knowledge of the exploit, which he said he saw Vizor using.
For years, hackers have targeted online video games to try to find flaws capable of installing and using cheats that give players an unfair advantage. Some cheat developers, such as Zebleer, sell their programs as a service, sometimes making millions of dollars. In response, video game companies have been hiring cybersecurity specialists to develop and fine-tune their anti-cheat systems to catch and ban game cheaters. In 2021, Activision released its Ricochet anti-cheat system, which runs at the kernel level in an attempt to make it even harder for cheat developers to get around it.
Vizor said they were able to find a unique way to exploit Ricochet, and use it against the players it was supposed to protect. The hacker realized Ricochet was using a list of specific hardcoded strings of text as “signatures” to detect hackers. For example, Vizor said, one of the strings was the words “Trigger Bot,” which refers to a type of cheat that automatically triggers a cheater’s weapon when their crosshair is over a target.
Vizor said they could simply send a private message — known as a “whisper” in the game — that included one of these hardcoded strings, such as “Trigger Bot,” and get the player they were messaging banned from the game.
“I realized that Ricochet anti-cheat was likely scanning players’ devices for strings to determine who was a cheater or not. This is fairly normal to do but scanning this much memory space with just an ASCII string and banning off of that is extremely prone to false positives,” said Vizor, referring to how the game was effectively scanning for banned keywords, regardless of context.
“The same day I found this, I got myself banned by sending a whisper message on Call of Duty to myself with one of the strings in the message contents,” said Vizor.

Vizor said that at one point they developed a script — “join a game, post a message, leave the game, join a new game, repeat repeat repeat,” as Vizor put it — that would run automatically and ban random players, which allowed them to go on vacation and still ban players. Vizor said that over the months that they were doing this, Activision would add new signatures to its anti-cheat system, which they would find soon after and use to ban players.
“I was most active with the trolling when [the] Ricochet anti-cheat team would add new string signatures. So if I check the [memory] region and see a new string, I will go crazy with it so they think they are detecting real cheaters,” said Vizor.
Activision did not respond to a request for comment.
A person who used to work at Activision, and still has knowledge of the work that the security and anti-cheat team do at the company, told TechCrunch that Ricochet was scanning for certain signatures and “that may have been weaponized against the anti-cheat,” essentially the technique Vizor was exploiting.
“If you know what signature the anti-cheat is looking for, I find a mechanism to get those bytes in your game process and you get banned,” said the person, who asked to remain anonymous. “I can’t believe [Activision] are banning people on a memory scan of ‘trigger bot.’ That is so incredibly stupid. And they should have been protecting the signatures. That’s amateur hour.”
Apart from random players, Vizor said they targeted some well-known players, too. In the period of time Vizor was using the exploit, some video game streamers posted on X that they had been banned, and then unbanned, once Activision fixed the bug.
The company was alerted of the existence of the bug when Zebleer published details of the exploit on X.
“It was nice to see it get fixed and see unbans,” said Vizor. “I had my fun.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-m4-pro-review-a-powerful-desktop-replacement/,Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro) review: A powerful desktop replacement | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-07,"On Monday, Bloomberg reported on Apple’s plans to fully overhaul its laptop line. That’s exactly the kind of rumor you don’t want to drop in the week between the announcement and launch of a new MacBook Pro. A deeper dive reveals that the planned revamp is coming at some point in 2026.
It’s still very much a rumor/early report, meaning that it might not happen in that time frame — if, indeed, it happens at all. A lot can change in 1.5 years, especially in this world of consumer electronics. But not all that much has changed since Apple’s premium laptop was released this time last year.
In fact, MacBook Pro releases are now more or less like clockwork. It’s an annual ritual built around the arrival of a new chipset, not unlike the iPhone release schedule. There’s no guarantee that Apple will continue the current release cadence for the M-series of chips, but it seems to be working well for the company so far.
Apple has its work cut out for itself, if it plans to deliver an iPhone and MacBook that are “the thinnest and lightest in their categories across the whole tech industry,” as the report states. The M-series delivered a much-needed shot in the arm to the line, making the last few generations of MacBook not only the most powerful, but the all-around best the company has delivered.
Efficiencies delivered via Apple Silicon are at the heart of the new Mac Mini overall, allowing the company to significantly shrink the desktop’s size. The question isn’t whether the M series will result in a literal thinning of the line; that much seems obvious. What is less clear, however, is whether sacrifices will be required.
For one thing, the Pro line’s processing power have thus far required Apple to include a fan — something now absent from the Air. For another, battery life is now a hallmark feature. I’m old enough to remember when liveblogging an event required me to haul an external battery around. These days, I don’t even have to think about plugging my MacBook Air in on a cross-country flight — which is great, because Delta’s seat-back power outlets are and have always been a disaster.
Apple rates the new Pros at 24 hours on a charge. If Apple wants to sacrifice a literal full day of battery life at the altar of making the laptop thinner, they’re going to have to pry it from my cold, dead hands.
The question of whether to buy now or wait for the next upgrade will forever loom over major consumer electronics purchases; that’s just the nature of the annual release cycle. That said, an early rumor about a major upgrade arriving at some point in 2026 shouldn’t move the needle much for those wondering whether to pull the trigger today. This time next year may be a different story.
For the time being, the buying advice remains largely unchanged from the last several years. If you’ve budgeted for a MacBook Pro, now is a fine time to get one. The refreshed M4 chips bring nice performance gains over last year’s, as the line continues to evolve and improve.
The MacBook Air continues to be the best choice for the vast majority of users. It’s more affordable, lighter weight, and performance differences are largely negligible for most non-professional tasks. The Air’s base RAM was increased to 16GB, but the line remains otherwise untouched.
They still sport the M3 chip, and that’s extremely unlikely to change this year. If Apple Intelligence is central to your purchasing decisions, going forward, know that the new features will be compatible with any M-series Mac, which now covers four years of laptops.
There’s a reason so much of the press material around the Pro involves things like 3D animation, music production, and resource-intensive STEM pursuits. At a certain point, enhanced performance on the high end has little impact on most users. That’s not to say such updates aren’t welcome, of course. For those who work in video editing or the sciences, for example, such breakthroughs could dramatically reduce the time required to execute such tasks.
Apple’s site suggests that “There’s never been a better time to upgrade.” That is, perhaps, true in the sense that these devices are continually improving. It’s less so, however, when assessing how dramatic a shift the line has made from generation to generation. From that perspective, the shift from Intel to the M1 was far more significant.
It’s also true that upgrade cycles are generally longer for laptops than smartphones, with respective averages of five and three years. Obviously, Apple like every other hardware company, would love it if you upgraded more often, but you’re a good person who is both concerned about e-waste and not made of money.
By default, Apple compares the new M4’s performance to the last generation of Mac Intel processors, released in 2019, with a drop-down that also features the M1 models. That’s fair enough, given the standard lifespan of a laptop — in fact, it may be overly optimistic on Apple’s part.
The company says the new M4 line is up to 9.8x faster than the Intel models and up to 3.5x faster than the M1 Pro and M1 Max. For its own purposes, Apple used an M4 chip with 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and 32GB of RAM. The test involved using Adobe Premier 2024’s Scene Edit Detection feature on a 3.5-minute clip. Your results will almost certainly vary, based on your hardware configuration, system settings, and the given task.
The model Apple sent to TechCrunch for review purposes is a 16-inch M4 Pro with a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 48GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage. The laptop runs $3,649 as configured. That’s $1,150 more than the base 16-inch M4 Pro model and a full $2,050 more than the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro. Even so, that puts the review model in the middle of the pack, price-wise. If you really want to go all out, the 16-inch Pro with a nano-texture display, M4 Max with 16-core CPU and 40-core GPU, 128GB of memory, and 8TB will run you $7,379.
Some things to keep in mind when spec-ing out your system. First, the 14-inch MacBook Pro is available in M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. The 16-inch only comes in M4 Pro and M4 Max flavors. At present, these are the only MacBooks with M4 chips. The iPad Pro was the first model with the processor, and the MacBook Air did not — and likely will not — get the upgrade in 2024.
You can find the full run down of the differences between the M4 models here. The long and short of it is the number of CPU and GPU cores available (the AI-focused Neural Engine is 16 cores on all modes) and memory bandwidth speeds. Memory bandwidth is more or less what it sounds like: the speed with which data can be read or written on memory by the processor. The range here is 120GB/s up to 410GB/s.
Another key difference between the chips is Thunderbolt support. The M4 supports Thunderbolt 4, with speeds up to 40GB/s. The M4 Pro and Max are the first Apple chips to support Thunderbolt 5 at up to three times the speed. For most, this will amount to futureproofing. The simple fact of it is that if you don’t know what Thunderbolt generation your cables and accessories support, it’s almost certainly not 5.
All three chips are more than capable for everything the vast majority of us throw at our systems, day-to-day. Aside from improved graphics processing for gaming, it’s hard to recommend the price increase that comes with the Pro and Max models for most users. In fact, it’s also hard to recommend the MacBook Pro instead of the Air for a majority of us. Even without the upgrade to M4, the Air remains the best MacBook for most.
The one upgrade option I’m surprised I’ve not seen more people mention is the addition of a nano-texture display for the first time ever on a MacBook. Apple notes:
The new MacBook Pro introduces an all-new nano-texture display option that dramatically reduces glare and distractions from reflections. In bright lighting conditions, the new MacBook Pro can now show SDR content at up to 1,000 nits and still displays HDR content at up to 1,600 nits of peak brightness. All together, it’s a game-changing experience for users working outdoors.
Simply put: If you’re buying a new Pro and plan to go outside ever, spend the additional $150. I presently have two Studio Displays on my desktop. One is nano-textured, the other isn’t. It makes a huge difference, even indoors. In fact, at one point I rearranged the two screens in a way that minimizes the glare from the one window in the room.
Glossy displays on Macs are one of those things we complained about years ago, but at a certain point, many of us were worn down by Apple’s refusal to offer an alternative over the years. I had given up on the idea years ago. Now that it’s available, I plan to get it for any MacBook I get, going forward. Working outside a couple of times a week is a great way to break up the monotony of an office job.
It may be the fact that I’ve been carrying around a 15-inch Air since my review back in March, but the 16-inch Pro is a freaking tank. At 4.7 pounds, it’s 1.3 pounds heavier than the 14-inch Pro and 1.4 pounds heavier than the 15-inch Air. The overall footprint is naturally larger, owing to the difference in screen sizes, but the 16-inch is notably thicker, as well, at 0.66 inch, 0.05 inch thicker than the 14-inch Pro and 0.21 inch thicker than the 15-inch Air.
That last bit is thanks, in no small part, to the Air’s somewhat ironic lack of a fan for cooling. Because of this, the Air will throttle performance. Some people may find themselves triggering the fan while gaming. Otherwise, it won’t make much of a difference for most users.
Ultimately, the 16-inch Pro is spiritually in line with what were once commonly referred to as “desktop replacements.” If you frequently find yourself working outside the office, it’s a pain to lug around. If, however, you’re looking for something with near desktop specs and a bit of flexibility, the Pro is closer to that sweet spot.
Ports continue to be a differentiator between the tiers. The Pro has three Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, an HDMI port, and an SD slot, whereas the Air only sports a pair of USB-Cs. More ports is generally better, and it’s great to see Apple continuing to include an SD reader on the laptop.
Both the M4 and M4 Pro chips support two external displays with up to a 6K at 60Hz, or either one 8K at 60Hz or one 4K at 240Hz. Upgrading to an M4 Max brings support for up to three 6K displays at 60Hz or one 6K at 60Hz plus one 4K at 240Hz.
The annual MacBook upgrade cycle means there largely isn’t much daylight between this year’s model and last’s. There’s little reason to have FOMO if you have any of the M-series models. The models released over the last four years have been among the best laptops Apple has ever released, owing to a combination of first-party silicon, product design, and just generally responding to consumer requests and complaints.
It’s unclear what a 2026 line refresh might hold, but as it stands, the M3 Air is still the best MacBook for most. If money and back pain are no object, however, the M4 series or Pros are a beast."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/lucid-motors-starts-taking-orders-for-its-existential-gravity-suv/,Lucid Motors starts taking orders for its existential Gravity SUV | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-11-07,"Lucid Motors has officially started taking orders for its electric Gravity SUV, a critically important vehicle that’s supposed to go into production by the end of this year. Interested buyers can now place $1,000 refundable deposits on the “Grand Touring” trim, which starts at $94,900, on the company’s website.
Similar to the company’s current model, the Air sedan, the Gravity is a more-than-capable electric vehicle. The company promises it can travel more than 440 miles on a full battery. That battery delivers power to two electric motors that put down the equivalent of 828 horsepower. It should be more functional than the Air, too, as it comes standard with two rows of seating and can be optioned up to three.
The launch of the Gravity is crucial to Lucid’s survival. While it has been able to increase sales of its Air sedan in the last few quarters by slashing prices and launching a cheaper trim, Lucid is still way off of the sales figures it originally projected when it went public in a $4 billion reverse merger in 2021. As a result, Lucid has repeatedly gone back to majority owner Saudi Arabia to add more funding to its war chest this year.
The Gravity comes in an SUV form factor that is far more attractive to North American buyers, which could boost overall sales. But the more affordable “Touring” version, which starts at $79,900, won’t be available until “late 2025.” And the Ground Touring version can quickly zoom past the $94,900 sticker price, as car reviewer Kyle Conner realized shortly after Lucid launched the Gravity SUV configurator on Thursday.
Affordability has been one of the bigger challenges for Lucid, especially because its vehicles are not eligible for the point-of-sale federal EV tax credit because they are too expensive. The company’s vehicles are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit that can be applied to leases. Of course, that is contingent on the federal tax credit surviving when President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year."

Automattic, which runs a rival web hosting service and is headed by Mullenweg, confirmed it created this site.
The site’s full URL is WordPressenginetracker.com, which is ironic given Mullenweg and Automattic have argued during the battle that WP Engine misused the WordPress trademark and tricked people into believing that WP Engine is associated with WordPress.com

As of the time of writing, the page shows more than 16,000 domains have switched to another hosting provider.
“The beauty of open source software is that everyone is able to access data on a granular level, because it’s all publicly available information. That public data has shown that ever since WP Engine filed its lawsuit – making it clear that they do not have an official association with WordPress and attracting greater attention to the company’s poor service, modifications to the WordPress core software, increasing and convoluted pricing structure, and repeated down times – their customers have left their platform for other hosting providers,” an Automattic spokesperson said.
The official WordPress handle on X has aggressively promoted offers and blogs detailing alternatives to the WP engine.
Right now, Mullenweg, Automattic, and WP Engine are locked in a legal battle. In the last week, Mullenweg and Automattic filed documents in court, asking the judge to dismiss some key claims in WP Engine’s case. The company also asked the court to reject WP Engine’s preliminary motion, which, if passed, restores the hosting provider’s access to WordPress.org, a WordPress repository site owned by Mullenweg.
Last week, at TechCrunch Disrupt, Mullenweg said that in the next few weeks, WP Engine will lose more than 8% of their business. Notably, Mullenweg had asked WP Engine to pay 8% of their revenue as a licensing fee for the WordPress trademark in September.
“They are losing a lot of customers, so we’ll see what happens. Like I said, we’re at war with them. We’re either going to go brick by brick and take — us and other companies take — every single one of their customers,” he said.
WP Engine used some of these comments in a court document filed earlier this week to support their motion.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/imac-m4-review-a-mini-upgrade-to-apples-entry-level-all-in-one/,iMac (M4) review: A mini upgrade to Apple's entry-level all-in-one | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-07,"iMac is the rock of Apple’s desktop line. Over the past decade we’ve seen the iMac Pro come and go, Apple struggling to crack the Mac Pro, and largely forgetting the Mac Mini existed for more than a decade. With two years and two models under its belt, the jury is still out on the Mac Studio’s longevity, though it’s nearly reached the halfway point of the iMac Pro’s short life.
The original iMac had a profound impact on Apple’s trajectory when it was introduced just over a quarter-century ago. Three years before the iPod, it represented the first major hit for Steve Jobs’ second go-round as CEO, helping rescue the company from the brink of bankruptcy.
The iMac is an easy machine to love. More than any other product in the portfolio, it represents the purest distillation of Apple’s original ethos. As a return to the all-in-one form factor, it harkens back to the Macintoshes of yesterday and “just works” right out of the box.
That’s not to say that it’s been entirely smooth sailing for the line. The iMac was affected during the recent period of indifference to the Mac line, as the company shifted most of its resources to the wildly popular iPhone. Between 2014 and 2021, we didn’t see any foundational changes to the system, as it retained the muted metal aesthetic that Apple introduced in 2007.
Along with the rest of the Mac line, iMac received a much-needed shot to the arm with the arrival of Apple Silicon. The all-in-one also returned to its colorful roots — an aesthetic insight into where the product stood relative to the rest of Apple’s desktops. It’s a more playful, entry-level system that’s at home inside a dorm room.
For businesses that want something a bit more serious, there’s still a silver option. After all, it’s the simplest Apple desktop when it comes to implementing devices at scale in the enterprise. It’s also a quick and easy solution when you need to, say, replace the receptionist’s computer at a dental office.
The main thing the iMac lacks is flexibility. It’s not a Mac Mini or Studio, where you can bring your own display. Nor is it the Mac Pro, with upgradeable RAM. To quote a popular preschool axiom, “You get what you get, and you don’t get upset.”
Gone are the days of the 27-inch option. The 24-inch iMac is compact, and that’s sort of the whole point. Barring the return of iMac Pro, there’s a single chip choice: the standard M4, in this case. If you want to upgrade to an M4 Pro, you’re going to have to venture outside the iMac line.
That’s not to say the new iMac is devoid of upgrade options. If you don’t mind the jump from $1,299 to $1,499, you’ll get four Thunderbolt ports (instead of two), while the 8-core CPU and GPU are upgraded to 10 cores, respectively. There are also options to upgrade the 16GB RAM to up to 32GB and the storage from 512GB to as much as 2TB. All of those specs combined will run you $2,699. Then there’s the glare-reducing nano-textured display (+$200), which I highly recommend, and swapping the Magic Mouse out for a Trackpad (+$50). I recommend that, as well, but ultimately, it’s a matter of which input you’re more comfortable with.
Ultimately, I expect that a large portion of the iMac’s expected audience will be perfectly content to stick with the base specs. The biggest variable is whether they plan to do any gaming on the system. While Apple prides itself in the strides it’s made on that front, I’d recommend at least upgrading the RAM and chip GPU, if you want to play the AAA titles the company recommends. That said, more options are generally better.
The iMac ships with a color-coordinated keyboard with Touch ID (but no number pad) and mouse. The coloring on the mouse is particularly subtle, as are the matching cables. They’re as subtle as a purple, pink, or yellow computer can be. Thanks in large part to EU regulators, these peripherals now ship with USB-C standard. As annoying as it might be to upgrade those Lightning cables, users will ultimately appreciate the convenience of a universal — and just generally better — connector.
That said, the Magic Mouse retains one of Apple’s biggest design fails, with the charging port on the bottom of the mouse. While it’s true that you won’t have to charge the peripheral very often, you frustratingly won’t be able to use the mouse when you do. The ability to use the Trackpad while charging is one of several reasons I prefer it.
The system is little changed from last year’s M3 model. Both sport a 4.5K Retina Display with up to 500 nits of brightness and up to 1TB of storage. This time out, Apple dropped the option with 8GB of RAM, making 16GB the default at the same entry-level price point, which is nice.
The webcam has gotten a bit of an upgrade, as well. It’s now 12-megapixels with support for Apple’s new(ish) Center Stage and Desk View features. Apple has also increased the number of color options available for the base system, adding yellow, orange, and purple options that previously required an upgrade to the four-port machine.
The biggest change is, of course, the M4 chip. The upgrade from the M3 brings larger memory bandwidth, increase CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine performance, all while reducing power consumption.
The iMac remains a great entry-level desktop for those who’d rather not be bothered buying an external monitor, keyboard, mouse, et al. It’s also an ideal system for IT departments to deploy at scale in offices — or for the aforementioned dentist front desk.
It’s a big upgrade for those with an older Intel system, but anyone who has bought an iMac since 2021 needn’t bother with an upgrade. It’s not going to make a huge difference for daily tasks, and those who are excited to try Apple Intelligence will be able to on any Mac with an M1 or later."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/apple-mac-mini-m4-review-more-power-in-a-tiny-package/,Apple Mac Mini (M4) review: More power in a tiny package | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-07,"For years, the Mini was the odd man out in the Mac desktop lineup. Apple has given plenty of love to the iMac over the years. The Mac Pro has had a few false starts, but the company is clearly committed to offering a true professional-grade desktop experience. The Studio is the new kid on the block, addressing a wide range of price points, from under $2,000 to upwards of $5,000.
When Apple announced the first wave of its M series of chips in 2020, it used the opportunity to reconnect with the Mini. The arrival of first-party silicon was enough reason to be excited, overshadowing the fact that the company hadn’t redesigned the system’s enclosure in the decade since the first Mini was announced.
Last week’s announcement marked the first major redesign to the product since 2010. That’s a long time for any company — let alone Apple — to keep a design around. Rumors that the newer, smaller Mac Mini would be “Apple TV size” turned out to be overstated. The desktop is larger than the Apple TV 4K in all three dimensions at 5 x 5 x 2 inches to the set-top box’s 3.66 x 3.66 x 1.2 inches.
That said, the new desktop is closer in size and proportions to Apple TV than it is to its own predecessor. As far as aesthetics, the Mini most closely resembles a scaled-down version of the Mac Studio, sharing that system’s brushed aluminum and rounded corners. It’s not a one-to-one, however.
Owing to its significantly smaller surface area, the Mini has fewer ports. It has three Thunderbolt ports on the back and a pair of pure USB-C ports up front — a nice addition to help avoid tangled wires. The Studio, meanwhile, sports either four or six Thunderbolt ports (depending on the chip), two USB-A ports and two USB-C ports (M2 Max only). Both the Mini and Pro sport an HDMI port and Ethernet jack, while only the studio has an SDXC card reader.
Like the Studio, the Mac Mini has a headphone jack, only it’s been moved to the front of the device. All said, Apple did a solid job keeping most of the ports intact. The Mini is also one of two Macs with Thunderbolt 5 as an option, as that feature was introduced with the new M4 Chip.
The Studio, on the other hand, had its last update in the M2 days. It’s fair to say that desktop is overdue for an update. That’s unlikely to launch this year. It’s worth noting, however, that a newer-generation chip doesn’t mean faster processing across the board. After all, the Ultra versions of Apple Silicon are best suited to handling more-complex workloads, and as of yet, there’s been no mention of an M4 version.
One of the odder design features echoes one of Apple’s most controversial choices. Just as the USB-C Magic Mouse retains the charging port on its underside, Apple shifted the power button from the rear of the desktop found on the Studio to the bottom. It’s not entirely clear whether this decision was pragmatic due to limited surface area or if it was simply an aesthetic choice, though my money is currently on the latter.
That said, this isn’t as frustrating a decision as the Magic Mouse. While it’s annoying to have to lift the Mini up to access the power button, the decision doesn’t impede one’s ability to use the system in the way it does on a mouse that needs to be charged upside down.
The other notable feature of the bottom is venting for the fan. While it’s true that Apple’s proprietary chips consume less power than their predecessors, they still get hot — especially in those instances where you’re pushing a Pro-level chip to its max. Beyond that, however, I suspect that most folks won’t trigger the fan too often, aside, perhaps, from gaming.
The Mini comes with either an M4 or M4 Pro. The former starts at a reasonable $599, with the upgrading pushing the cost up to $1,399. That’s $100 more than the new M4 iMac, which includes its own display, keyboard with Touch ID, and a mouse. Obviously there’s a difference in performance between the M4 and M4 Pro, but it’s worth noting just how quickly the price creeps up.
The model Apple sent TechCrunch for review sports an M4 Pro with 14 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores, 48GB of memory, and 1TB of storage. It runs $2,299 as configured. That’s $300 more than the entry-level M2 Pro Studio. A fully specced-out Mini with 8TB of storage and 64GB of memory will run $4,699. Toss in a nano-textured Studio Display, Magic Keyboard, and Magic Trackpad, and we’re suddenly at just a hair under $7,000.
Once the price hits those heights, you begin to wonder precisely where the Mini sits in the line. I would place it between the iMac and Mac Studio. Essentially, it’s the starter Mac desktop for those who want to bring their own monitor to the party. Its compact size is nice, taking up significantly less desk space than the Studio, but it’s still not portable due to the nature of it being a desktop.
If true portability is what you’re after, buy a MacBook. You can always use it to power a couple of monitors. You can pick up a new 13-inch MacBook with the 16GB RAM upgrade for $999 right now — though it’s worth noting that you’ll need an M3 chip or higher if you want to power two monitors. If it’s really just an entry-level desktop you want, the new M4 iMac starts at $1,299.
The new Mac Mini is a case of a (mostly) well-designed machine without an entirely clear market segment. Its sweet spot is those who already have a monitor or monitors and are just looking to upgrade their system with the newest entry-level Mac. I would toss in those who want to pick out their own monitor, but don’t want to invest in the Studio and don’t particularly care about the freedom a laptop brings. Or maybe the platonic ideal is someone who wants a quick, easy, and (relatively) cheap desktop to supplement it — without the built-in limitations of an all-in-one iMac.
If any of the above rings true, by all means, go small. There’s little that’s inherently bad about the machine (the power button is more annoying than bad), but it’s not entirely clear where it stands in the Apple desktop lineup, with the Studio and iMac flanking it on either side.
I can’t tell you for sure how large that segment of the market is at present, but I suspect the system is most purchased in the enterprise. It’s easy to imagine companies buying these up in bulk. For consumers who are on the fence, consider whether a MacBook or iMac makes more sense for your setup and pocketbook."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/why-founders-shouldnt-chase-massive-tams/,Why founders shouldn’t chase massive TAMs | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-07,"Brigid O’Brien has seen her share of pitches from founders, and she has a message for many of them: Not every investor will be impressed by your massive TAM, short for total addressable market.
“Often people are chasing big TAMs, which makes a lot of sense, because we’re investing in venture capital, so we’re looking for outsized returns,” O’Brien, a partner at RA Capital Planetary Health, said at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. “You need to have a market that can help support that.”
“That’s probably one of the favorite slides a lot of people like to do on a pitch deck,” she said. “I’ve seen a lot of pitch decks that have a trillion-dollar TAM. Sometimes I see $100 trillion.”
But that thinking can also lead founders astray, O’Brien added.
“I often say to founders, really be intentional about what your market entry is in a market. Sometimes chasing the biggest TAM isn’t necessarily the first step on your journey building a company. Think about where you have the likely and highest probability of market entry to generate revenue. And then you can also go and chase that larger TAM later by being able to have that cash to help capitalize your company and de-risk some of the tech.”
By way of example, O’Brien pointed to the approach taken by fellow panelist, Gurinder Nagra, co-founder and CEO of Furno Materials. The startup is building small, modular kilns that produce cement with a much lower climate impact. They stand in stark contrast to the massive, $1 billion kilns that have become the standard among industry incumbents.
“What the incumbents have been really good at is building really large capital-intense assets, which have been their moats for the last 100 years,” Nagra said. “But in an environment where you need to change, that all of a sudden becomes a weakness. So how can you leverage that as a startup? Because speed is your advantage.”
But rather than confront incumbents head on, Furno is starting by finding customers in markets that are currently underserved by cement producers.
“We did boots on the ground travel and trips and talked to some of these concrete producers. And sure enough, they’re like, ‘I keep getting unallocated cement. I got some last week, but I didn’t get it this week.’ Because they’re not a priority. They’re a smaller-scale customer,” Nagra said.
Eventually, when the company has established itself, it’s likely it’ll start wooing customers who already have cement supply contracts with incumbents. “There’s not much loyalty in the cement business,” he said."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/ulysses-is-using-robots-to-restore-seagrass-populations/,Ulysses is using robots to restore seagrass populations | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-11-07,"Seagrass punches above its weight. The marine plant only occupies 0.1% of the ocean floor but can be credited with supporting marine ecosystems of plants and fish, filtering ocean water, and capturing quite a bit of carbon. Seagrass is also being destroyed, due to climate change and other factors, with meadows reducing 7% globally each year. Ulysses Ecosystem Engineering wants to restore it.
Ulysses’ autonomous robot can be loaded with seeds and programmed to go to specific areas of the ocean floor to plant seagrass. Akhil Voorakkara, a co-founder and CEO at San Francisco-based Ulysses, told TechCrunch that the robot they’ve built has been able to speed up restoration by 100x compared to having volunteers plant the grass seeds by hand and at a fraction of the cost of other robots.
Jamie Wedderburn, now CTO, got the idea for the company while on a surf trip with friends on the West Coast of Scotland in early 2023. One of his friends mentioned a recent awful volunteering experience they had that involved planting seagrass on a particularly harsh day of Scottish weather. More than 40 volunteers painfully planted seagrass that ended up just getting wiped away by rough conditions.
Wedderburn hadn’t known about the importance of seagrass, and hearing this story sent him down a rabbit hole. He thought there must be a way to use technology to make processes like that better. Wedderburn pitched the idea to Voorakkara, who proceeded to also fall down the same rabbit hole. The company’s other two co-founders, Colm O’Brien and Will O’Brien, had similar reactions.
“I knew that would be fun immediately,” Will O’Brien told TechCrunch. “Also getting the opportunity to build a mission-driven company that works primarily in the oceans, and is really focused on nature and biodiversity, is just like, you know, it was that was extremely compelling to me as well. Growing up as a kid, my hero was Steve Irwin.”
Voorakkara said that the team decided to pursue this problem by building a robot because, while none of them had marine biology experience, they did have experience building robots. They quickly made a 3D prototype which wasn’t waterproof and leaked when they used it, but it worked well enough at injecting sesame seeds, to show them there was something there. Once they had conviction they turned to experts for help.
“None of us are marine biologists,” Voorakkara said. “You won’t get anything unless you ask and we did ask for help and advice very early on in our journey to the top people working in seagrass restoration and making sure it wasn’t crazy. These people were super excited about what we are doing and were super willing to work with us.”
Ulysses launched in early 2024 and has since earned nearly $1 million in revenue from both private companies and government organizations. The startup has partnerships with multiple government agencies in places like Florida and Australia for large-scale restoration projects too.
The startup is now emerging from stealth and announcing a $2 million pre-seed funding round led by Lowercarbon Capital with participation from VCs Superorganism and ReGen Ventures, in addition to angel investors. Voorakkara said the startup will use the funds to bolster its team of five by adding engineers and people focused on go-to-market strategies.
Timing is on Ulysses’ side, as many governments are putting more emphasis and urgency on restoring seagrass meadows. Earlier this year the European Union passed a new regulation focused on restoring different habitats by 2030 and 2050, with seagrass specifically named.
Voorakkara said that this month the company will be testing a new capability for the robot: being able to harvest seeds from approved seagrass beds and then planting those seeds where they are needed.
While seagrass is currently the company’s main focus, they think of it as the beginning. Will O’Brien said that the tech is really autonomous drones connected to a main platform so it can expand into other areas like coastal management, coastal security and other types of restoration.
“The oceans really are this frontier in humanity that is extremely under explored,” O’Brien said. “There is not a lot of novel technological solutions and it’s because it’s an extremely difficult domain, dealing with currents, [it’s] very unforgiving when you have all these things. [We want to] bring SpaceX levels of innovation to this new domain here on earth.”
There are other companies looking to build underwater robots too. Terradepth is one that has raised more than $30 million in VC to focus on mapping the ocean floor for both commercial and government goals. Eelume is another out of Norway that is focused on ocean discovery.
“In five years, we don’t want to just be doing seagrass restoration, we want to be managing hundreds of kilometers of coastline,” Voorakkara said. “We want to supercharge groups like NOAA, the U.S. Coast Guard, and everyone working on serving the ocean and protecting it in a much more efficient manor.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/socialcrowd-raises-2-5m-seed-round-as-interest-in-future-of-work-software-remains/,SocialCrowd raises $2.5M seed round as interest in future of work software remains | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-11-07,"Back in February, when TechCrunch spoke to Raphael Akinsipe, he described his company SocialCrowd as a “Fitbit but for work.” As CEO and co-founder, he explained that the product allows companies to set goals for employees and then reward them when those expectations are met.
“For example, we had a restaurant incentivize their staff by rewarding them $1 for every five daily specials sold,” Akinsipe told us recently. “And in 90 days their sales grew 490%.”
At the time, he was announcing a $1.6 million pre-seed, led by Bread & Butter Ventures. But after some growth and traction, he’s back again to announce the closing of a $2.5 million seed round, co-led by Bread & Butter Ventures and Augment Ventures.
The company knew after it closed its pre-seed that it would raise another round to meet consumer demand. “We have seen incredible growth across verticals; we knew we would need to expand our engineering, customer success, and sales,” Akinsipe told TechCrunch.
Employers had to become more creative during the pandemic to retain their employees and that mentality hasn’t necessarily gone away. Early on, Akinsipe said the company had a large focus on restaurants but it has now expanded to focus on working with companies that overall have a large hourly blue-collar workforce, like retail and manufacturing. Now SocialCrowd is growing at an average of 20% a month, he said, but he declined to offer more specifics, such as any kind of a revenue metric.
Employers aren’t the only ones paying attention to performance management software. Investors, too, have always invested heavily in the space. Business and productivity software companies have raised $41.9 billion so far in venture funding this year; of course, that is down from the record $67.6 billion raised in 2021, which is slightly more than the $36.3 billion raised last year, according to PitchBook data.
“We had incredibly strong interest in our round from top-flight investors. We were able to close our round in just a couple of months,” Akinsipe said. He thinks continued interest in this sector comes from employers still facing problems with retention and optimization, while interest in his company comes from the fact that “our team has demonstrated a strong ability to execute on product and sales.”
FullCircle, Serac Ventures, and VC414 also participated in SocialCrowd’s latest funding round.
“We have remained bullish on ‘the future of work’ as a category throughout the fluctuations of the market and remote vs. in-person cycles of the last few years,” Mary Grove, managing partner of Bread & Butter Ventures, told TechCrunch. “One area, in particular, we see with huge potential to invest in is technology that improves worker and employer experiences for frontline and shift workers, a group that is hugely important to the backbone sectors of the U.S. and global economy. SocialCrowd is a great example of a company building at the core of this opportunity.”
Competitors in this space include Bonusly and Awardco, though Akinsipe says SocialCrowd is different in that it focuses exclusively on the frontline and shift workers and that its platform is more performance-based rather than sentiment-based, where managers gift awards based on feelings.
SocialCrowd’s latest funding round is going to once again help it expand its engineering and customer success team, as well as help it further expand verticals. There is a plan, of course, to even expand into AI."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/anthropic-teams-up-with-palantir-and-aws-to-sell-its-ai-to-defense-customers/,Anthropic teams up with Palantir and AWS to sell AI to defense customers | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-07,"Anthropic on Thursday said it is teaming up with data analytics firm Palantir and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide U.S. intelligence and defense agencies access to Anthropic’s Claude family of AI models.
The news comes as a growing number of AI vendors look to ink deals with U.S. defense customers for strategic and fiscal reasons. Meta recently revealed that it is making its Llama models available to defense partners, while OpenAI is seeking to establish a closer relationship with the U.S. Defense Department.
Anthropic’s head of sales, Kate Earle Jensen, said the company’s collaboration with Palantir and AWS will “operationalize the use of Claude” within Palantir’s platform by leveraging AWS hosting. Claude became available on Palantir’s platform earlier this month and can now be used in Palantir’s defense-accredited environment, Palantir Impact Level 6 (IL6).
The Defense Department’s IL6 is reserved for systems containing data that’s deemed critical to national security and requiring “maximum protection” against unauthorized access and tampering. Information in IL6 systems can be up to “secret” level — one step below top secret.
“We’re proud to be at the forefront of bringing responsible AI solutions to U.S. classified environments, enhancing analytical capabilities and operational efficiencies in vital government operations,” Jensen said. “Access to Claude within Palantir on AWS will equip U.S. defense and intelligence organizations with powerful AI tools that can rapidly process and analyze vast amounts of complex data. This will dramatically improve intelligence analysis and enable officials in their decision-making processes, streamline resource intensive tasks and boost operational efficiency across departments.”
This summer, Anthropic brought select Claude models to AWS’ GovCloud, signaling its ambition to expand its public-sector client base. GovCloud is AWS’ service designed for U.S. government cloud workloads.
Anthropic has positioned itself as a more safety-conscious vendor than OpenAI. But the company’s terms of service allow its products to be used for tasks like “legally authorized foreign intelligence analysis,” “identifying covert influence or sabotage campaigns,” and “providing warning in advance of potential military activities.”
“[We will] tailor use restrictions to the mission and legal authorities of a government entity” based on factors such as “the extent of the agency’s willingness to engage in ongoing dialogue,” Anthropic says in its terms. The terms, it notes, do not apply to AI systems it considers to “substantially increase the risk of catastrophic misuse,” show “low-level autonomous capabilities,” or that can be used for disinformation campaigns, the design or deployment of weapons, censorship, domestic surveillance, and malicious cyber operations.
Government agencies are certainly interested in AI. A March 2024 analysis by the Brookings Institute found a 1,200% jump in AI-related government contracts. Still, certain branches, like the U.S. military, have been slow to adopt the technology and remain skeptical of its ROI.
Anthropic, which recently expanded to Europe, is said to be in talks to raise a new round of funding at a valuation of up to $40 billion. The company has raised about $7.6 billion to date, including forward commitments. Amazon is by far its largest investor."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/canada-orders-shutdown-of-tiktok-offices-over-security-risks-but-wont-block-app/,Canada orders shutdown of TikTok offices over security risks (but won't block app) | TechCrunch,Ingrid Lunden,2024-11-07,"With all eyes on how a new Trump administration in the U.S. will interface with China Tech in the years ahead, its neighbor to the north has leveled a blow to one of the biggest apps to come out of the country.
Canada has ordered the closure of ByteDance’s operations in Canada — specifically the offices of TikTok Technology Canada, Inc. — citing national security risks. Those risks do not extend to the app itself: Consumers can still download, use, and create content for TikTok, and businesses can still advertise on it. “The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,” said François-Philippe Champagne, the country’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, in a statement.
The statement did not specify more about the security risks. But the company has been under scrutiny for years over how it handles user data on the platform. Critics allege variously that user data is harvested by China and in ways that cannot be fully audited. TikTok has repeatedly denied that this is the case.
The closure impacts “hundreds” of jobs in Canada, TikTok said in a statement to TechCrunch. It plans to appeal the decision.
“Shutting down TikTok’s Canadian offices and destroying hundreds of well-paying local jobs is not in anyone’s best interest, and today’s shutdown order will do just that,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We will challenge this order in court. The TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.”
The company had been hiring most recently for dozens of roles across operations, engineering, and marketing in different locations in the country.
TikTok, by one estimate, has around 15 million registered users in Canada, working out to a penetration of about 41% of the population. In line with how it’s used elsewhere, among adults, those aged 18 to 24 are more engaged, according to eMarketer. But that study does not cover children, who as we know also love TikTok. It’s a controversial issue in itself due to concerns over children’s mental health.
Despite its mega popularity, TikTok has been simmering in hot water in Canada for a while now. This latest development is the result of a national security review under the “Investment in Canada” Act. That review was prompted after Canada banned the use of TikTok on all government devices in February 2023. That ban remains intact.
The company’s precarious situation in the country may have also had an impact on how it has developed further services there. TikTok Shop, the company’s in-app e-commerce platform for selling and buying goods, was expected to launch in Canada by the end of 2023, but it has yet to do so. The Creator Rewards Program, for paying creators, also has yet to launch there, too.
Canada is far from the only country making efforts to rein in TikTok.
In addition to problems facing TikTok specifically in other countries, the app is also netted into a wider reassessment of social media in general. Just yesterday, the government in Australia announced a proposal to ban all social media for users under the age of 16.
International government attention around national security and TikTok really got its start during the last Trump administration, when the president laid out a plan to ban the app in the country — where it now has 170 million users — unless its operations there were separated and sold to a U.S. entity. Four years on, that case there is still ongoing, with TikTok appealing a signed order to sell its U.S. app operations by January 2025.
It’s anyone’s guess what will happen next, since Trump, ironically, reversed course over the summer. “I’m for TikTok because you need competition,” he said in July after joining the app himself."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/glint-solar-grabs-8m-to-help-accelerate-solar-energy-adoption-across-europe/,Glint Solar grabs $8M to help accelerate solar energy adoption across Europe | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-11-07,"Solar energy is booming, which is good news for Glint Solar. The Norwegian software-as-a-service (SaaS) startup has built a platform that’s helping energy giants and large solar developers such as E.ON, Recurrent Energy, and Statkraft cut the time it takes to plan and pre-design solar installations to accelerate the transition to renewables.
Glint’s software pulls in data from multiple sources to help speed up solar project assessments. The platform features adaptable layout designs and yield estimates, along with country-specific geographic information system (GIS) data and topographic analysis to make it easer for solar developers to evaluate potential sites. Cloud-based collaboration features allow teams to access essential project data. The platform can also be used as a project presentation aid by serving up 3D-rendered project layouts “in seconds.”
Since TechCrunch last spoke with the climate startup in June 2022, when it closed a $3 million seed round, its customer base has grown almost 10x, according to CEO and co-founder Harald Olderheim. It’s now announcing an $8 million Series A to keep stoking the growth fire by expanding into more markets in Europe.
Its main regions for customers currently are France, Germany, the Nordics, and the U.K. but with the new funding, the March 2020-launched SaaS will be expanding its sales teams to target customers in “the rest of Europe,” including Italy and Spain, Olderheim says.
One notable change since Glint Solar launched is that it’s narrowed the service proposition to support the planning of land-based solar installations — dropping an earlier dual product focus that had included floating-solar installations, too.
Olderheim said the software can still be used for planning floating solar. But he noted there’s more demand for ground-based installations. “It’s a bigger market,” he said, explaining why they’ve opted to streamline their sales approach.
Glint Solar also isn’t focused on roof-mounted solar installations. Some of its customers are using its software to help plan solar arrays on “big rooftops” as well, per Olderheim. But, again, the reason it’s not focusing effort there is because it’s going after the largest demand chunk.
“If you look at the market, about 60% of the market is utility, large scale. And then about 20% is big rooftops, and 20% is residential. So we are going for the biggest market,” he told TechCrunch. “If you want to make a big impact in the world … we can do it through the utility scale, because that’s much faster if you’re going to build increase the [solar] energy in the world.
“If you think the impact we are making by one solar plant, a big one — like 10 megawatt, maybe with 7,000 or 15,000 solar panels — it’s a very efficient way of growing the energy production fast.”
Another big focus for the Series A cash injection is product development. Olderheim said the startup will be expanding its platform to help customers plan where to site batteries that can be used to optimize renewable investments by storing energy.
Factors such as grid capacity, protected areas, and sound (since batteries produce some noise once operational) are all considerations the software will be able to factor in, per Olderheim, as well as providing customers with support to ensure a battery is compatible with the proposed solar array and helping them share the information with landowners as they work to obtain the necessary permits.
He emphasizes how much the cost of solar installations have dropped over the last decade (down around 90%). But he also says that projects still aren’t happening as fast as they need to given the existential threats of a heating planet that are driving waves of disasters, from devastating floods and hurricanes to heatwaves, droughts, and forest fires.
“It takes time to get all the agreements — with the land owner, with the grid, and with the municipality — to [deliver a solar project] and all these processes take time; so that’s one of the reasons we are doing Glint Solar,” he adds.
The startup is very focused on software design to maximize accessibility as another tactic to help remove friction from solar project approvals.
“We are making it very user friendly so everyone in a team can use one software together and work on this problem to make [project delivery] much faster. And you can share everything — with the land owner, with the grid, with the municipality — so they can easily take decisions much faster with the lower risk.”
The platform has multiple “modules” that allow the same person to, for example, “evaluate the site, organize all the projects, and design a solar park,” per Olderheim, supporting project teams to get more applications out.
He also flags the platform’s cloud-based collaboration features that allow everyone to work “in the same tool,” which he suggests help give it an edge versus other tools.
Glint says customers are reporting its SaaS is helping solar developers to triple their project pipeline on average and evaluate potential sites 10x faster than traditional methods.
Of course software can only do so much. Olderheim agrees that infrastructure investment and regulatory reform are key to further accelerating solar rollouts, pointing to grid capacity and solar permitting as the main areas for lawmakers to tackle.
“Sometimes it takes five years from a [project] to start to get building,” he points out, adding: “I know the EU is looking at this to reduce it to 12 or 24 months. So I think that’s a very good [start].”
Glint Solar’s Series A is led by Smedvig Ventures, with additional investment from Antler Nordic and Antler Elevate, Futurum Ventures, and Momentum.
Commenting in a statement, Jonathan Lerner, partner at Smedvig Ventures, said: “The solar industry has done a great job at developing ways to harvest green energy, but now we need better processes to get these plans in motion. This is the gap that Glint Solar is filling. As one of the first unified products for utility projects on the market, solar developers, engineers, analysts and management can find everything they need to locate the best land spaces quickly and accurately. This is a much-needed evolution from manually trawling through data from multiple sources, saving considerable resources in all-important green energy projects.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/truecaller-founders-step-down-as-spam-blocker-regains-momentum/,Truecaller's founders step down as the spam blocking app regains momentum | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-11-07,"The co-founders of Swedish caller identification app Truecaller are stepping back from day-to-day operations, marking the end of an era for one of Sweden’s most successful consumer technology companies.
Alan Mamedi and Nami Zarringhalam (pictured above), who co-founded Truecaller in 2009, will hand over control in January to Rishit Jhunjhunwala, the company’s product chief and head of its crucial Indian business. Both founders will remain with the company as strategic advisers and board members.
“We’re approaching half-a-billion users, and I am convinced we can reach one billion users within a few years,” said Mamedi in his final quarterly statement as chief executive. “We are one of the very few companies globally whose product has managed to attract hundreds of millions of people. By doing that, we have put Sweden on the world map, [and] that accomplishment is something my co-founder Nami and I are incredibly proud of.”
Jhunjhunwala, who joined in 2015 and holds a Swedish passport, inherits a company whose stock is rebounding after a tough few years. The company’s shares lost value steadily following its IPO in 2021, and last year fell more than 32% overnight after the firm reported a 20% decline in quarterly advertising revenues, mostly due to a contracting advertising market.
The stock has recovered well since then, however, nearly doubling in value, and Truecaller on Wednesday said its third-quarter revenues rose 15% to SEK 457.3 million ($42.3 million). More significantly, advertising revenue increased 8% in the third quarter after several quarters of decline — alleviating concerns about its crucial ad revenue stream.
The company also showed promising growth in strategic markets like Colombia and Nigeria, where user numbers jumped 40% year-over-year. Subscription revenues in the U.S. rose more than 60% as the company focused on converting users to paying customers.
J.P. Morgan analysts have noted that new market entries and emerging revenue streams could drive further upside for the stock.
Truecaller dominates caller identification in emerging markets, but has found it difficult to penetrate developed economies. And while iPhone users represent just 7% of the company’s user base, they generate 40% of its subscription revenue — a disparity that highlights both the challenges and opportunities ahead.
Recognizing that opportunity, the company plans to launch what its executives are calling its “largest product improvement ever” for iOS this quarter in an effort to match some of the app’s capabilities on Android.
It's been an incredible journey @AlanMamedi @Zarringhalam. So proud of you guys, from where the company started to now growing faster than ever in users!And very supportive of this transition to @rishj who I have tremendous respect for, and has built the org alongside you… https://t.co/5CkOHi1qzT
“Having worked closely with Alan and Nami since 2015, I know these are big shoes to fill,” said Jhunjhunwala, who has overseen product development and the company’s two largest revenue streams.
Jhunjhunwala will have to navigate a hopeful but challenging market. The company faces regulatory scrutiny in India, where it generates over 70% of its revenues. Recent reports suggested that telecom operator Airtel’s new spam-blocking tool could threaten Truecaller’s dominance, though early reviews of the telco’s offering favor Truecaller.
“We have a fantastic management team in whom we have immense trust,” said Mamedi and Zarringhalam in a joint statement. “With these pieces in place, we are convinced that the company is well positioned for future success.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/australia-looks-to-ban-social-media-for-kids-under-age-16/,Australia looks to ban social media for kids under age 16 | TechCrunch,Connie Loizos,2024-11-07,"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Wednesday announced plans in the country to ban social media for children under 16, saying that “social media is doing harm to our kids, and I’m calling time on it.”
The proposed legislation will enter parliament this year, taking effect a year after lawmakers ratify it, said Albanese, adding that there will be no exemptions for parental consent. This means platforms like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, X, and likely YouTube will bear the responsibility to prevent access by children, per a Reuters report.
Australia’s approach is among the strictest globally, but numerous other countries are moving in the same direction. Norway’s prime minister last month said the country will soon enforce an age limit on use of social media of 15 up from age 13, saying it needs to more aggressively campaign against profit-driven tech companies that are “pitted against small children’s brains.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/prediction-markets-set-to-pay-out-450m-to-election-bettors/,'Prediction markets' set to pay out $450M to election bettors | TechCrunch,Connie Loizos,2024-11-07,"Following Donald Trump’s election victory, thousands of bettors anticipate a potential $450 million payout from online betting sites, says Reuters. As Trump’s odds surged on so-called prediction markets near the end of the race, platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket gained attention for diverging sharply from traditional polls, which suggested a much closer race.
Talking with the outlet, a Princeton neuroscience professor credited the markets’ comparative accuracy to their ability to “measure crowd wisdom where no hard data is available.”
Backers in Kalshi plainly saw what was coming. As TechCrunch reported last week, its investors loaned the outfit tens of millions of dollars in short-term loans to pay its customers.
Their individual winnings may pale in comparison to a Polymarket bettor known as the “Polymarket whale.” As Reuters notes, the French former trader made $40 million worth of Trump-related bets on the site. If Trump also wins the popular vote, the “whale” will reportedly walk away with $80 million."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/spacex-to-launch-starship-for-the-sixth-time-this-month/,SpaceX to launch Starship for the sixth time this month | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-11-06,"SpaceX will conduct the sixth flight test of Starship, the largest rocket ever built, as soon as November 18, following the smooth success of the previous mission less than a month ago.
The high flight cadence is thanks, in part, to that success, which included the first-ever return of the Super Heavy booster to the launch site — where massive “chopstick” arms jutting from the launch tower caught it in mid-air — and a controlled, on-target splashdown after suborbital flight of the Starship upper stage in the Indian Ocean. This sixth test includes many of the same objectives; this fact led the Federal Aviation Administration to approve both flight 5 and 6 at the same time last month. Up until this point, SpaceX has needed to wait (sometimes months) for regulatory approval before each Starship launch.
In a post on its website, SpaceX says it will attempt to re-create these same successes on November 18, including catching the booster at the launch site and an accurate Starship splashdown. The company will also continue to test the heat shield and maneuvers for the upper-stage reentry, “to expand the envelope on ship and booster capabilities and get closer to bringing reuse of the entire system online.” Engineers also introduced a number of upgrades to the system, including more redundancy in the booster propulsion system, updated software controls, and other changes.
SpaceX will also attempt to relight one of the Ship’s six Raptor engines on orbit, a key capability to eventually also reuse the Starship upper stage. Engineers will put this stage through its paces in other ways as well: The company will test new secondary thermal protection materials. In addition, as the company put it, “The ship also will intentionally fly at a higher angle of attack in the final phase of descent, purposefully stressing the limits of flap control to gain data on future landing profiles.”
All this testing will culminate in “significant upgrades” to the ship, starting with flight 7, like redesigned flaps, larger propellant tanks, and the most up-to-date thermal protection.
A live webcast of the test will start around 30 minutes before the 30-minute launch window at 2 p.m.  PT, which will be viewable on X or SpaceX’s website. This late-afternoon launch window (which opens at 4 p.m. local Texas time) will enable better viewing conditions upon reentry, SpaceX said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/irobot-lays-off-another-105-employees/,iRobot lays off another 105 employees | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-11-06,"Roomba maker iRobot is laying off 105 employees — about 16% of the company’s workforce, per an SEC filing — saying the cuts are part of an “operational restructuring plan.”
The move comes after iRobot slashed roughly 350 jobs — about 31% of its workforce — earlier this year. Those cuts were made after plans for an Amazon acquisition fell through. Amazon planned to acquire iRobot for $1.7 billion, but the companies mutually terminated the agreement, noting that they didn’t see a path to regulatory approval in the European Union. iRobot received a $94 million termination fee from Amazon as a result.
iRobot CEO Gary Cohen addressed the latest cuts during the company’s Q3 2024 earnings call on Wednesday.
“These moves, while challenging, have fundamentally changed the way we work with our partners to efficiently develop and build our robots,” Cohen said. “Our new operating model is able to deliver a significant increase in new product introductions with less than half the internal resources and approximately one-third the cost.”
Since the start of 2024, the company has reduced its global workforce by approximately 50%."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/apple-ios-18-2-public-beta-arrives-with-new-ai-features-but-some-remain-waitlisted/,"Apple iOS 18.2 public beta arrives with new AI features, but some remain waitlisted | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-11-06,"Apple has released the AI-powered version of its latest mobile operating system, iOS 18.2, to its public beta users. The update includes new features like an AI emoji generator app called Genmoji, an Image Playground AI image app, ChatGPT integration with Siri, and visual search using the iPhone 16 cameras, among other things. Previously, these features were only available to developers.
Though consumers can now get in line to try out the new AI features, there is a caveat to be aware of: some of them will require joining a waitlist for access.
Collectively, the AI features and tools coming to the new iPhone 16 and other supported devices are known as Apple Intelligence, which can be cleverly abbreviated as “AI” for short. The large language model-driven technologies promise users a smarter Siri, writing and proofreading assistance across apps, and image generation capabilities, among other things. Third-party developers will also be able to take advantage of Apple Intelligence features in their own apps — something that could ultimately prove to be Apple Intelligence’s most useful offering, if widely adopted.
For instance, users could ask Siri to show them information from inside their apps, or take action on something that appears on their screen. At Apple’s developer conference in June, the company said its AI technology would first be made available to specific categories of apps, including Books, Browsers, Cameras, Document readers, File management, Journals, Mail, Photos, Presentations, Spreadsheets, Whiteboards, and Word processors.
In the meantime, users will most likely want to try the features involving ChatGPT and image creation.
Image Playground introduces a standalone image-generation app where you can create new images via prompts. Genmoji offers a similar system for creating custom emojis. And Image Wand will be able to transform your rough sketches in your notes into AI-generated images.
With Siri, users can enable a new ChatGPT extension that gives Apple’s virtual assistant an expanded set of capabilities. For instance, you’ll be able to ask ChatGPT to help you write text, answer questions, create images, and more. If signed in, it can keep a history of your requests, too. Paid subscribers will also be able to use ChatGPT’s advanced capabilities their membership provides — a mutually beneficial deal for the companies where ChatGPT gets massive exposure via the iPhone installed base, while Apple gets a smarter Siri.
iPhone 16 users can also press the new Camera Control button to launch Visual Intelligence, a way to search and identify real-world objects and places through the camera lens.
Unfortunately for those who were itching to try Apple Intelligence, a waitlist for some features is still required. Apple Intelligence has to first be enabled (as it’s not turned on by default), then users will have to sign up for other image-creation features before access is granted. Apple has not said how long users will have to wait before gaining access, but it could be days or even weeks during this beta period.
In part, that’s due to AI safety concerns — already, users are designing NSFW emoji with Genmoji, for example — but it also gives Apple time to safely scale the features to its users.
Ahead of the iOS 18.2 release, Apple launched AI features including Writing Tools and notification summaries powered by Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.1, as well as debuted the new look for Siri, where the edges of the screen glow.
Alongside the iOS 18.2 beta, Apple also released the first public betas of iPadOS 18.2, macOS Sequoia 15.2, and tvOS 18.2."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/the-ftc-comes-after-neobank-dave-for-misleading-marketing-hidden-fees/,"The FTC comes after neobank Dave for misleading marketing, hidden fees | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-11-06,"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Tuesday that it will be taking action against the online cash app and neobank Dave, which it says used “misleading marketing to deceive consumers.” At issue is how Dave marketed $500 cash advances to consumers that it rarely offered, and the “Express Fee” it charged if customers wanted their money immediately.
The FTC claimed the service was misleading because Dave’s marketing implied that its cash advances would be “instant,” using terminology like “on the spot” to describe them, without disclosing the fees involved until after the consumer completed the sign-up process and gave Dave access to their bank account.
The fees ranged anywhere from $3 to $25, the complaint stated. If the user chose not to pay the fee, they’d have to wait two to three business days for the standard transfer to go through, the complaint says. What’s more, the FTC says, Dave would also sometimes charge a surprise fee, which it described as a “tip.” The user interface was designed to make this difficult for users to detect or avoid the fee, leading to consumers feeling scammed, according to the FTC.
This latter issue is another example of the “dark patterns” — or manipulative design practices — companies use to guide users to take actions benefiting their own goals, not the consumers. Examples of the type of behavior the FTC now wants to penalize are things like automatically checking boxes when users sign up, or showing larger buttons for the actions the company wants users to take.
According to a recent study by the agency, a majority of subscription apps and websites use dark patterns to trick consumers.
In Dave’s case, consumers were shown images of a cartoon child surrounded by food and messaging like “10 Healthy Meals,” “15 Healthy Meals,” or “20 Healthy Meals,” implying that the tip would go to providing meals for people in need. However, the FTC says that only 10 cents of each “tip” is donated and the company keeps the remaining amount. In other words, the tip doesn’t actually provide a full meal, much less 10 to 20 meals. Also, when consumers tried to lower their tip, they would see an image of the food being taken away from the child until they were left with an empty plate, the complaint says.
According to SEC filings, Dave received more than $149 million in revenue from tips from 2022 through the first six months of 2024, the FTC said.
Another issue was that Dave charges a $1 monthly membership fee debited directly from customers’ bank accounts. But when users discovered the fee, they were not able to easily cancel it, according to the complaint. Some even tried to delete their account to escape the fee and were still charged, the FTC says.
The full complaint includes several screenshots of Dave’s tricky techniques, which the FTC says are in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act (ROSCA). The agency is seeking an injunction to stop Dave from continuing its behavior and may also seek a monetary award or other relief as deemed by the court.
In response to the complaint, Dave said that it’s “disappointed” the FTC has chosen to file suit.
“The FTC asserts many incorrect claims regarding Dave’s disclosures and how the Company acquires consent for the fees associated with our products,” a company statement reads. “For the avoidance of doubt, Dave’s ability to charge subscription fees and optional tips and express fees is not in question. We believe this case is another example of regulatory overreach by the FTC, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves. We take compliance and customer transparency very seriously and believe that we have always acted within the law. We remain focused on serving our members who love and rely on our products,” it said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/the-other-election-night-winner-perplexity/,The other election night winner: Perplexity | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-11-06,"On Tuesday, two AI startups tried convincing the world their AI chatbots were good enough to be an accurate, real-time source of information during a high-stakes presidential election: xAI and Perplexity.
Elon Musk’s Grok failed almost instantly, offering wrong answers about races’ outcomes before the polls had even closed.
On the other hand, Perplexity offered helpful, real-time election insights and maps throughout the night, linking to reliable resources and offering historical context where appropriate.
Perplexity took a risky bet, and it paid off.
Late last week, the startup announced the launch of its election information hub, featuring real-time maps populated with voting data from Democracy Works and the Associated Press, the same information sources that power Google’s election map. This approach was different from most other AI chatbots, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini, which simply refused to answer questions related to the election.
It’s understandable why most AI labs sat this election out. It was the safe and responsible choice for many of them, as they’ve been plagued by embarrassing hallucinations at some point or another in the last year.
In particular, OpenAI recently released its Google competitor, ChatGPT Search. But the Sam Altman-led startup didn’t trust the feature to answer questions about this election, directing users to Vote.org instead. ChatGPT Search is still an early product, which is too unreliable for people to use in everyday scenarios, and OpenAI seems to have recognized that.
In contrast, Perplexity has been testing its Google competitor out in the real world since December 2022 and clearly felt it had enough data to give this election a shot.
Perplexity’s election night success could set it back in its ongoing fight with media companies; specifically, Dow Jones’ recent lawsuit claiming the startup competes with media companies for the same audiences. Despite the many outbound links within the AI chatbot’s answers, Perplexity’s election hub was itself a destination on election night, and it didn’t require users to venture off the app to get all their information. It certainly seems like Perplexity was competing with media companies, who were also vying for eyeballs on election night, even though Perplexity collects its information from those outlets. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas even claimed “record traffic” the day before and clearly hoped to maintain that momentum.
While Perplexity had deals with Democracy Works, the AP, and a few other media companies to power election features, the startup also indiscriminately used live election coverage from other media outlets such as CBS, CNN, and the BBC.  Sure, Perplexity offered attribution, but the company hasn’t announced any revenue-sharing partnerships with these outlets and it’s unclear if any money changed hands.
First, let’s start with Perplexity’s election features that had nothing to do with generative AI: the charts.
People typically love visual election charts, clicking into them and seeing granular data on a state-by-state level. It was a smart move for Perplexity to build these out and ensured their AI systems were not the sole source of information in the app.
When visiting Perplexity’s election hub, users were met with a familiar-looking electoral map of the United States, with some states blue for Kamala Harris and others red for Donald Trump. Obviously, Perplexity didn’t reinvent the wheel with this feature — copying the display Google and every TV network shows — but they didn’t need to. Throughout the night, this map appeared to update every minute or so, reflecting the information on the Associated Press’ website. It was a good way to follow the election.
There were bugs in Perplexity’s map periodically throughout the night. Srinivas responded to users on X that were reporting flaws, such as Perplexity not reporting the percentage of votes that had been counted, and quickly addressed them.
Perplexity offered another familiar feature, a state-by-state tracker, giving real-time information about swing states.
Now for the AI part. When asked questions about the current state of the presidential race, Perplexity answered with hedged responses that still gave mostly accurate information. These answers weren’t as insightful as a commentator on CNN, nor as entertaining as The New York Times’ election needle (which made a comeback this year). However, Perplexity only showed a few small hallucinations and largely produced relevant facts in a timely manner. That’s more than I can say for any other AI chatbot on the market.
When trying to answer follow-up questions about Harris’ lead in “Blue Wall” states, Perplexity did hallucinate slightly. It was referencing polling data, when it should have been referencing real-time votes at this point in the night. However, the general information here was in the right ballpark, and other AI chatbots just wouldn’t answer this question.
Here’s another follow-up question we tried: What ballots have yet to be counted in swing states? It was hard to find an answer to this question elsewhere. Granted, the only useful answers here were for Pennsylvania and North Carolina, but at least Perplexity didn’t hallucinate for the other states.
This election was the first to feature AI chatbots as a source of information around our democratic processes. However, this will not be the last election where that’s the case. Well-funded AI startups are fighting to deliver information to people in new, faster, more concise ways. Accuracy will be key to success here moving forward. So far, Perplexity has the early lead."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/openai-acquired-chat-com/,OpenAI acquired Chat.com | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-06,"OpenAI bought Chat.com, adding to its collection of high-profile domain names.
As of this morning, Chat.com now redirects to OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the acquisition via email.
Chat.com is one of the older domains on the web, having been registered in September 1996. Last year, it was reported that HubSpot co-founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah acquired Chat.com for $15.5 million, making it one of the top two all-time publicly reported domain sales.
Shah announced last March that he’d sold Chat.com to an unnamed buyer. And late today, in a post on X, he confirmed that OpenAI was that buyer — implying that he’d been paid in OpenAI shares.
The domain name doesn’t appear to have changed hands since it sold last year, indicating that OpenAI isn’t hosting ChatGPT on Chat.com — so this probably doesn’t represent a brand change.
OpenAI declined to say how much it paid for Chat.com."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/what-trumps-win-might-mean-for-elon-musk/,What Trump’s win might mean for Elon Musk | TechCrunch,"Rebecca Bellan, Aria Alamalhodaei",2024-11-06,"Elon Musk — the billionaire CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI, and the owner of The Boring Company, Neuralink, and X — took a sharp swing to the right this election to support President-elect Donald Trump, using his vast wealth, influence, and megaphone on X to influence the outcome of the election.
Musk’s support came in spite of Trump’s anti-EV stance and climate change skepticism, and it’s a pivot from the executive’s relationship with Trump years ago. Musk served on two advisory councils during Trump’s first term, but left them both in protest of Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords.
Musk — who is worth over $260 billion and donated over $100 million to a pro-Trump super PAC — is now poised to be the incoming president’s most influential political and business adviser. Trump promised Musk the position as head of a new Department of Government Efficiency during a September appearance at the Economic Club of New York.
Musk has nicknamed the not-yet-formed department DOGE, a nod to a meme-joke cryptocurrency that he’s favored in the past, causing the coin to jump in market capitalization over 6% in the last 24 hours.
The role could give the billionaire executive the power to recommend deep cuts to what he thinks of as a “vast federal bureaucracy … holding back America in a big way.”
During Trump’s victory speech, he gave his biggest donor a shoutout, calling Musk a “super genius” and adding that “we need to protect our geniuses.” Trump said separately on Tuesday night, “A star is born, Elon.”
Many have predicted that there will be a falling-out between the two huge personalities before Trump’s four-year term is over, but even if a fraction of Musk’s plans for DOGE become reality, it could mark one of the most consequential instances of a businessman helping shape the policy and regulations that govern his businesses.
Here’s what we think a Trump win means for Musk and his businesses.
While Trump has gained power largely by marketing himself as a good businessman, despite several bankruptcies, Musk can at least claim that he has been successful in his endeavors (X notwithstanding). According to Jon McNeill, former president of Tesla, that’s due to a formula centered around innovation through subtraction and radically simplifying problems.
This includes steps like questioning every requirement, deleting every step possible in the process before building them back in, and automating workflows. We should expect to see Musk take a similar approach to government spending if he is appointed to his promised role, which would task him with conducting a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms,” according to comments made by Trump in September.
On Tuesday night, Musk said he would look to trim the fat of all government agencies, livestreaming a Q&A as he flew on a private jet from Texas to watch the election results with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.
“There’s a lot of duplicate responsibility where multiple agencies actually have overlapping portfolios,” Musk said. “There’s a lot of people that work for the government that we just need to transition them to more productive roles in the private sector.”
Musk noted that job cuts would be done “in a humane way” and floated the idea of paying government employees for two years while they searched for new jobs. He also mused about imposing term limits on bureaucrats.
“We still want to see regulations, they just need to be necessary,” he said. “I liken it to referees on a field. You don’t want to have no referees, but you don’t want to have more referees than players. That’s crazy.”
Musk’s businesses have received government assistance across numerous administrations. Most recently, Tesla benefitted from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which provided hundreds of billions in subsidies for investing in renewable energy projects, as well as EV tax credits for buyers.
Tesla has earned more than $2 billion in 2024 from clear air credits that it sells to other automakers under Environmental Protection Agency rules.
Now Trump, who has talked previously about ending a nonexistent “EV mandate,” is expected to roll back many of Biden’s EV policies. If he ends subsidies for EVs, that could be additional good news for Tesla given that many of its rivals are still trying to catch up to it.
“Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-subsidy environment,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.
Tesla stock was up almost 15% mid-day Wednesday.
SpaceX stands to benefit from the Trump administration, too. During his first term, Trump enacted a number of major changes to American space policy, including standing up the U.S. Space Force and reestablishing the National Space Council for the first time in 24 years. There aren’t anticipated to be any major changes to America’s space priorities, especially its flagship program to return humans to the moon, Artemis. But the 2024 Republican Party platform included a clear, albeit brief, paragraph that space was a key emerging industry in which America should play a leading role: The country will send astronauts “back to the moon, and onward to Mars,” the document states.
In recent weeks, Trump has significantly upped his talk of space exploration. At an October 24 rally, he gave SpaceX’s crewed missions to Mars his blessing: “We will land an American astronaut on Mars. Thank you, Elon. Get going, get that spaceship going, Elon.” In a separate speech, he said he wanted “to reach Mars before the end of my term.”
The next Earth-Mars transfer window is in 2026, so an uncrewed mission to Mars could indeed take place before the end of this second Trump term. It’s likely no coincidence, given the time Musk and Trump spent together on the campaign trail, that this is the most recent timeline that Musk himself has given for SpaceX’s plans for the Red Planet: “The first Starships to Mars will launch in 2 years … If those landings go well, then the first crewed flights to Mars will be in 4 years,” he said on X.
Hitting those timelines could require changes within the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates commercial launches in the United States. SpaceX has been waging an increasingly public war of words over the FAA’s purported inability to keep up with the pace of commercial innovation. The agency’s “superfluous” delays, as SpaceX put it in a recent blog post, could be a prime target for Musk’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency.
Musk isn’t the only space billionaire eager to make connections with the President: Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin welcomed a visit from Trump at the end of October. (On the same day, the Washington Post, owned by Bezos, announced it would not endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in the paper’s history.)
As for X, the Musk-owned social media platform, and xAI, his burgeoning AI company, the impacts of Trump’s win are less clear, though Musk has begun to speculate already on potential ripple effects.
More than 200 advertisers have stopped advertising on X since Musk took over, including Apple, Disney, IBM, Paramount, and Sony. Musk thinks that will change now that Trump has won the White House.
A recent global survey conducted by market research firm Kantar found that 26% of marketers plan to decrease spending on X in 2025 due to concerns that extreme content on the platform could damage their brands. Still, during Musk’s recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, he said, “I think if Trump wins, we’ll see probably most of the boycott lift.”
X has also been the focus of several federal investigations, including from the Federal Trade Commission, which has investigated the platform’s privacy practices under Musk, of whom FTC chair Lina Khan has been openly critical. In late October, Musk said, “She will be fired soon.”
Musk has further gone head-to-head with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the years. Last year, the agency sued Musk and tried to subpoena him in relation to his purchase of Twitter stock and disclosures about his investment in the company. Musk called for a “comprehensive overhaul” of the SEC in response.
Meanwhile, Musk’s AI company, xAI — which is reportedly hoping to raise several billion dollars atop its recent $6 billion Series B at a $40 billion valuation — might benefit from a lack of AI regulation from the Trump administration. Experts say they expect a light-touch regulation approach from Trump, one where he relies on existing legislation rather than passing any new laws.
Matt Mittelsteadt, a research fellow at George Mason University, thinks the biggest impact to AI could come from trade policies. Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and 60% on Chinese-made products, which could have an economic impact on the AI sector."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/this-week-in-ai-its-shockingly-easy-to-make-a-kamala-harris-deepfake/,This Week in AI: It's shockingly easy to make a Kamala Harris deepfake | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-06,"Hiya, folks, welcome to TechCrunch’s regular AI newsletter. If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here.
It was shockingly easy to create a convincing Kamala Harris audio deepfake on Election Day. It cost me $5 and took less than two minutes, illustrating how cheap, ubiquitous generative AI has opened the floodgates to disinformation.
Creating a Harris deepfake wasn’t my original intent. I was playing around with Cartesia’s Voice Changer, a model that transforms your voice into a different voice while preserving the original’s prosody. That second voice can be a “clone” of another person’s — Cartesia will create a digital voice double from any 10-second recording.
So, I wondered, would Voice Changer transform my voice into Harris’? I paid $5 to unlock Cartesia’s voice cloning feature, created a clone of Harris’ voice using recent campaign speeches, and selected that clone as the output in Voice Changer.
It worked like a charm:
I’m confident that Cartesia didn’t exactly intend for its tools to be used in this way. To enable voice cloning, Cartesia requires that you check a box indicating that you won’t generate anything harmful or illegal and that you consent to your speech recordings being cloned.
But that’s just an honor system. Absent any real safeguards, there’s nothing preventing a person from creating as many “harmful or illegal” deepfakes as they wish.
That’s a problem, it goes without saying. So what’s the solution? Is there one? Cartesia can implement voice verification, as some other platforms have done. But by the time it does, chances are a new, unfettered voice cloning tool will have emerged.
I spoke about this very issue with experts at TC’s Disrupt conference last week. Some were supportive of the idea of invisible watermarks so that it’s easier to tell whether content has been AI-generated. Others pointed to content moderation laws such as the Online Safety Act in the U.K., which they argued might help stem the tide of disinformation.
Call me a pessimist, but I think those ships have sailed. We’re looking at, as CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate Imran Ahmed put it, a “perpetual bulls— machine.”
Disinformation is spreading at an alarming rate. Some high-profile examples from the past year include a bot network on X targeting U.S. federal elections and a voicemail deepfake of President Joe Biden discouraging New Hampshire residents from voting. But U.S. voters and tech-savvy people aren’t the targets of most of this content, according to True Media.org’s analysis, so we tend to underestimate its presence elsewhere.
The volume of AI-generated deepfakes grew 900% between 2019 and 2020, according to data from the World Economic Forum.
Meanwhile, there’s relatively few deepfake-targeting laws on the books. And deepfake detection is poised to become a never-ending arms race. Some tools inevitably won’t opt to use safety measures such as watermarking, or will be deployed with expressly malicious applications in mind.
Short of a sea change, I think the best we can do is be intensely skeptical of what’s out there — particularly viral content. It’s not as easy as it once was to tell truth from fiction online. But we’re still in control of what we share versus what we don’t. And that’s much more impactful than it might seem.
ChatGPT Search review: My colleague Max took OpenAI’s new search integration for ChatGPT, ChatGPT Search, for a spin. He found it to be impressive in some ways, but unreliable for short queries containing just a few words.

Apple acquires Pixelmator: AI-powered image editor Pixelmator announced on Friday that it’s being acquired by Apple. The deal comes as Apple has grown more aggressive about integrating AI into its imaging apps.
An ‘agentic’ Alexa: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy last week hinted at an improved “agentic” version of the company’s Alexa assistant — one that could take actions on a user’s behalf. The revamped Alexa has reportedly faced delays and technical setbacks, and might not launch until sometime in 2025.
Pop-ups on the web can fool AI, too — not just grandparents.
In a new paper, researchers from Georgia Tech, the University of Hong Kong, and Stanford show that AI “agents” — AI models that can complete tasks — can be hijacked by “adversarial pop-ups” that instruct the models to do things like download malicious file extensions.
Some of these pop-ups are quite obviously traps to the human eye — but AI isn’t as discerning. The researchers say that the image- and text-analyzing models they tested failed to ignore pop-ups 86% of the time, and — as a result — were 47% less likely to complete tasks.
Basic defenses, like instructing the models to ignore the pop-ups, weren’t effective. “Deploying computer-use agents still suffers from significant risks,” the co-authors of the study wrote, “and more robust agent systems are needed to ensure safe agent workflow.”
Meta announced yesterday that it’s working with partners to make its Llama “open” AI models available for defense applications. Today, one of those partners, Scale AI, announced Defense Llama, a model built on top of Meta’s Llama 3 that’s “customized and fine-tuned to support American national security missions.”
Defense Llama, which is available in Scale’s Donavan chatbot platform for U.S. government customers, was optimized for planning military and intelligence operations, Scale says. Defense Llama can answer defense-related questions, for example like how an adversary might plan an attack against a U.S. military base.
So what makes Defense Llama different from stock Llama? Well, Scale says it was fine-tuned on content that might be relevant to military operations, like military doctrine and international humanitarian law, as well as the capabilities of various weapons and defense systems. It also isn’t restricted from answering questions about warfare, like a civilian chatbot might be:
It’s not clear who might be inclined use it, though.
The U.S. military has been slow to adopt generative AI — and skeptical of its ROI. So far, the U.S. Army is the only branch of the U.S. armed forces with a generative AI deployment. Military officials have expressed concerns about security vulnerabilities in commercial models, as well as legal challenges associated with intelligence data sharing and models’ unpredictability when faced with edge cases.
Spawning AI, a startup creating tools to enable creators to opt out of generative AI training, has released an image dataset for training AI models that it claims is fully public domain.
Most generative AI models are trained on public web data, some of which may be copyrighted or under a restrictive license. OpenAI and many other AI vendors argue that fair-use doctrine shields them from copyright claims. But that hasn’t stopped data owners from filing lawsuits.
Spawning AI says its training dataset of 12.4 million image-caption pairs includes only content with “known provenance” and “labeled with clear, unambiguous rights” for AI training. Unlike some other datasets, it’s also available for download from a dedicated host, eliminating the need to web-scrape.
“Significantly, the public-domain status of the dataset is integral to these larger goals,” Spawning writes in a blog post. “Datasets that include copyrighted images will continue to rely on web-scraping because hosting the images would violate copyright.”
Spawning’s dataset, PD12M, and a version curated for “aesthetically pleasing” images, PD3M, can be found at this link."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/pinstripe-wants-to-redefine-the-way-online-sellers-sell-secondhand-clothing/,Pinstripe wants to redefine the way online sellers sell secondhand clothing | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-11-06,"Pinstripe aims to reimagine the secondhand market by offering sellers the opportunity to have both a digital storefront and a physical retail presence.
Launched in June, the platform offers an alternative approach compared with other marketplaces like Archive, Depop, Facebook Marketplace, and Poshmark. With Pinstripe, sellers take their clothes to local consignment stores, vintage shops, and retailers, where store employees handle the handoff process, freeing sellers from the burden of dealing with in-person interactions. Pinstripe also recently introduced an automated offer system that uses its AI-powered assistant to manage the bid and ask process.
Sellers often face the stress of setting up booths at flea markets or organizing pop-up sales to sell vintage or secondhand clothing, accessories, and other curated items. Those looking to sell clothes from their own closets also encounter challenges, such as the discomfort of having strangers visit their homes or the difficulties of coordinating public meetups. Additionally, the hassle of shipping products can be another huge headache.
With the rise of the secondhand retail market — driven by the increasing acceptance of buying used items and the fast fashion industry’s contribution to landfill waste — Pinstripe founders Sam Blumenthal and Taro Tomiya recognized the need for a better solution.
“Both of us are secondhand shoppers as well as sellers,” Blumenthal told TechCrunch. “The pain point we really identified was it’s easy to shop secondhand, but it’s really hard to sell. The reason that we have landfills that you can see from outer space, that 82 pounds of clothing are thrown away per person in America a year, is because it’s much easier to throw something out than it is to sell or donate it.”
Pinstripe is currently available only to users in New York City, where finding decent closet storage is a significant challenge and stores have ample unused space.
“What we do is we connect people with too much clothing and stores with too much space. We recognize there’s a synergistic exchange, but what the stores want is more traffic and more profit, and what the influencers want is a way to monetize their wardrobe and the way to get rid of it instantly,” said Blumenthal.
Sellers seem to benefit the most from this arrangement, receiving 70% of the sales revenue. In contrast, Pinstripe takes 20%, while the retail partners receive the remaining 10%.
Even though its retail partners take the smallest slice of the pie, Blumenthal reports positive feedback, as the platform aims to help businesses that lack an online presence or social media marketing teams. However, he also acknowledges that the limited staff at some of these stores could present challenges, as it requires additional storage space and manpower to facilitate transactions.
Blumenthal and Tomiya also recognized that some customers may feel frustrated with other marketplaces because they can’t try on the clothes before purchasing. Pinstripe offers the benefit of allowing buyers to browse and purchase items online while also experiencing the clothing in person. Customers can try on items, and if they aren’t satisfied with them, they can request a refund.
In addition, Pinstripe offers next-day courier delivery for $10. However, it’s important to note that buyers who select the delivery option can’t try before they buy, and all purchases are final. Only in-person shoppers are eligible for refunds.
While Pinstripe stands out from many of its competitors, the app experience is what users would typically expect.
For buyers, there is an algorithm that curates options based on their personal style. Buyers can filter listings by size, price, brand, color, condition, and more. Additionally, there is a map feature that allows users to discover nearby sample sales, flea markets, pop-up shops, and estate sales. The pickup process is standard; buyers receive an email or app notification when their item is ready. To collect their purchase, they must have the confirmation code.
Sellers can create listings, upload photos, write descriptions, and set prices on the platform. One noticeable difference is there’s no in-app messenger to chat with buyers.
Pinstripe’s new AI-powered feature, called “Offer,” utilizes ChatGPT and open source models to assist sellers in managing the bidding process. Sellers can now request that the AI assistant accept offers automatically.
Also, if an item doesn’t sell after 30 days, sellers can choose to have it donated, and Pinstripe sends local charities to pick it up and donate it on their behalf.
Pinstripe evolved from a similar startup founded by Blumenthal and Tomiya in 2022 called Banter, an e-commerce platform that featured multiplayer shopping and social elements, allowing consumers to connect with like-minded shoppers. Last February, the startup raised approximately $900,000 in a small pre-seed funding round from Breakers VC, General Advance, Muchmore Ventures, and Unpopular Ventures.
“We pivoted after seeing this massive new trend that my friends, my co-founder, and I are behaving from a consumer standpoint, which is thrifting secondhand fashion. Many of these brands and stores are not capitalizing on [the shift],” said Blumenthal.
Pinstripe is available in the App Store and on the web. It touts a few thousand or so monthly active users and works with almost a dozen retail partners, including Club Vintage, Lahn Shop, Leisure Centre, and the Brooklyn Vintage Club.
The platform also has notable advisers on board, including Ben Max Rubinstein and Julie Bornstein (former Stitch Fix and Daydream founder)."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/what-trumps-victory-could-mean-for-ai-regulation/,What Trump's victory could mean for AI regulation | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-06,"A grueling election cycle has come to a close. Donald Trump will be the 47th president of the U.S., and, with Republicans in control of the Senate — and possibly the House — his allies are poised to bring sea change to the highest levels of government.
The effects will be acutely felt in the AI industry, which has largely rallied against federal policymaking. Trump has repeatedly said he plans to dismantle Biden’s AI policy framework on “day one” and has aligned himself with kingmakers who’ve sharply criticized all but the lightest-touch regulations.
Biden’s AI policy came into force through executive order, the AI Executive Order, passed in October 2023. Congressional inaction on regulation precipitated the executive order, whose precepts are voluntary — not compulsory.
The AI EO addresses everything from advancing AI in healthcare to developing guidance designed to mitigate risks of IP theft. But two of its more consequential provisions — which have raised the ire of some Republicans — pertain to AI’s security risks and real-world safety impacts.
One provision directs companies developing powerful AI models to report to the government how they’re training and securing these models, and to provide the results of tests designed to probe for model vulnerabilities. The other provision directs the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to author guidance that helps companies identify — and correct for — flaws in models, including biases.
The AI EO accomplished much. In the last year, the Commerce Department established the U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI), a body to study risks in AI systems, inclusive of systems with defense applications. It also released new software to help improve the trustworthiness of AI, and tested major new AI models through agreements with OpenAI and Anthropic.
Critics allied with Trump argue that the EO’s reporting requirements are onerous and effectively force companies to disclose their trade secrets. During a House hearing in March, Representative Nancy Mace (R-SC) said they “could scare away would-be innovators and impede more ChatGPT-type breakthroughs.”
Because the requirements lean on an interpretation of the Defense Production Act, a 1950s-era law to support national defense, they’ve also been labeled by some Republicans in Congress as an example of executive overreach.
At a Senate hearing in July, Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, expressed concerns that “preemptive overregulation attempts” would “entrench the tech incumbents that we already have.” Vance has also been supportive of antitrust, including efforts by FTC chair Lina Khan, who’s spearheading investigations of big tech companies’ acqui-hires of AI startups.
Several Republicans have equated NIST’s work on AI with censorship of conservative speech. They accuse the Biden administration of attempting to steer AI development with liberal notions about disinformation and bias; Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) recently slammed NIST’s “woke AI ‘safety’ standards” as a “plan to control speech” based on “amorphous” social harms.
“When I’m re-elected,” Trump said at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last December, “I will cancel Biden’s artificial intelligence executive order and ban the use of AI to censor the speech of American citizens on day one.”
So what could replace Biden’s AI EO?
Little can be gleaned from the AI executive orders Trump signed during his last presidential term, which founded national AI research institutes and directed federal agencies to prioritize AI R&D. His EOs mandated that agencies “protect civil liberties, privacy, and American values” in applying AI, help workers gain AI-relevant skills, and promote the use of “trustworthy” technologies.
During his campaign, Trump promised policies that would “support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing” — but declined to go into detail.
Some Republicans have said that they want NIST to focus on AI’s physical safety risks, including its ability to help adversaries build bioweapons (which Biden’s EO also addresses). But they’ve also shied away from endorsing new restrictions on AI, which could jeopardize portions of NIST’s guidance.
Indeed, the fate of the AISI, which is housed within NIST, is murky. While it has a budget, director, and partnerships with AI research institutes worldwide, the AISI could be wound down with a simple repeal of Biden’s EO.
In an open letter in October, a coalition of companies, nonprofits, and universities called on Congress to enact legislation codifying the AISI before the end of the year.
Trump has acknowledged that AI is “very dangerous” and that it’ll require massive amounts of power to develop and run, suggesting a willingness to engage with the growing risks from AI.
This being the case, Sarah Kreps, a political scientist who focuses on U.S. defense policy, doesn’t expect major AI regulation to emerge from the White House in the next four years. “I don’t know that Trump’s views on AI regulation will rise to the level of antipathy that causes him to repeal the Biden AI EO,” she told TechCrunch.
Dean Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University, agrees that Trump’s victory likely augurs a light-touch regulatory regime — one that’ll rely on the application of existing law rather than the creation of new laws. However, Ball predicts that this may embolden state governments, particularly in Democratic strongholds like California, to try to fill the void.
State-led efforts are well underway. In March, Tennessee passed a law protecting voice artists from AI cloning. This summer, Colorado adopted a tiered, risk-based approach to AI deployments. And in September, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed dozens of AI-related safety bills, a few of which require companies to publish details about their AI training.
State policymakers have introduced close to 700 pieces of AI legislation this year alone.
“How the federal government will respond to these challenges is unclear,” Ball said.
Hamid Ekbia, a professor at Syracuse University studying public affairs, believes that Trump’s protectionist policies could have AI regulatory implications. He expects the Trump administration to impose tighter export controls on China, for instance — including controls on the technologies necessary for developing AI.
The Biden administration already has in place a number of bans on the export of AI chips and models. However, some Chinese firms are reportedly using loopholes to access the tools through cloud services.
“The global regulation of AI will suffer as a consequence [of new controls], despite the circumstances that call for more global cooperation,” Ekbia said. “The political and geopolitical ramifications of this can be huge, enabling more authoritarian and oppressive uses of AI across the globe.”
Should Trump enact tariffs on the tech necessary to build AI, it could also squeeze the capital needed to fund AI R&D, says Matt Mittelsteadt, another research fellow at George Mason University. During his campaign, Trump proposed a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and 60% on Chinese-made products.
“Perhaps the biggest impact will come from trade policies,” Mittelsteadt said. “Expect any potential tariffs to have a massive economic impact on the AI sector.”
Of course, it’s early. And while Trump for the most part avoided addressing AI on the campaign trail, much of his platform — like his plan to restrict H-1B visas and embrace oil and gas — could have downstream effects on the AI industry.
Sandra Wachter, a professor in data ethics at the Oxford Internet Institute, urged regulators, regardless of their political affiliations, not to lose sight of the dangers of AI for its opportunities.
“These risks exist regardless of where you sit on the political spectrum,” she said. “These harms do not believe in geography and do not care about party lines. I can only hope that AI governance will not be reduced to a partisan issue — it is an issue that affects all of us, everywhere. We all have to work together to find good global solutions.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/ai-coding-assistants-can-help-startups-develop-products-seed-vcs-believe/,"AI coding assistants can help startups develop products, seed VCs believe | TechCrunch",Julie Bort,2024-11-06,"By now, there’s hardly a coder in the world who isn’t using an AI copilot in some way. But using GitHub Copilot or Cursor.AI to ask technical questions and get debugging help could be just the beginning. AI coding may one day involve agents that can write the programs themselves based on a natural language prompt. Such programs may even replace human engineers.
AI coding startups that can generate code from a natural language prompt include Replit and Bubble, among many others.
Eventually, some VCs believe, companies will hire fewer human engineers and have each human manage AI coding agents. “It’s not pie in the sky. It’s in the near future, but it’s not today,” VC Corinne Riley, partner at Greylock, said onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt last week.
Coding assistants are already commonly allowed during the coding technical interview for prospective hires at many of Greylock’s portfolio companies, she added.
However, she doesn’t believe that AI agents should ever be used to replace human engineers in really young companies, to save cash. At the seed stage, “what you’re doing is you’re building the foundations of the company, right? And so if you’re making major engineering trade-offs at that stage, it’s probably not the right decision. Those are decisions that you can make in the future,” she said.
Yet, cash management is also the very reason why young startup engineers should be using AI coding assistance as much and as well as they can right now, countered VC Elizabeth Yin, co-founder and general partner of Hustle Fund, onstage.
“One of the major challenges of the early stages, you don’t quite know exactly what problem you’re solving and quite exactly what the ICP [ideal customer profile] is and quite exactly what they need. So you’re going to end up throwing out a lot of work. So the faster you can go, and the faster you can iterate, the better in order to learn quickly,” Yin said.
She believes early-stage startups should be open to any tool that lets founders quickly hack together sample products to move faster, even if it would all have to be carefully rebuilt more thoughtfully later. “I would actually be a proponent of that if it means you can learn that much faster,” she said.
That’s in contrast to the days before AI, when every pilot would have to be coded by someone who had the skills. Today, an engineer can prompt a model, use some AI debugging, and take a peek.
In agreement is VC Renata Quintini, co-founder of early-stage Renegade Partners.
“If it’s about discovering product-market fit or testing out, you should use that leverage, but I wouldn’t worry about optimizing this at the seed stage,” she said onstage.
Interestingly, as startups founded in 2024 launch out of the gate using AI development processes, we could be witnessing the seeds of the first future AI agent workforce. And the first people to get AI agents as co-workers would be coders themselves. It’s a thought that is equal parts ironic and prophetic."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/how-trumps-election-could-affect-the-startup-friendly-inflation-reduction-act/,How Trump's election could affect the startup-friendly Inflation Reduction Act | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-06,"President-elect Donald Trump spent plenty of time on the campaign trail railing against key portions of the Inflation Reduction Act, from solar and wind tax credits to electric vehicles and environmental justice initiatives.
But his return to the presidency doesn’t necessarily spell the end of the landmark legislation. While Trump’s administration is unlikely to be supportive of certain climate tech startups, it will have a harder time ending the broadly popular law.
The Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, ushered in a range of tax credits and incentives aimed at reducing carbon pollution in the U.S. and attracting climate-friendly industries to the country. On both accounts, it’s been successful. Carbon emissions are down, and investment in climate tech is up.
Startups have broadly benefited from the Inflation Reduction Act. Tax credits have encouraged investors to plow money into nuclear power, hydrogen, and all things EV-related. Nuclear power, which is one of the more expensive sources of electricity in the U.S., receives a production tax credit under the law. Green hydrogen does, too, which could help it achieve cost parity with fossil fuel-derived hydrogen much more quickly. Battery startups have benefited as major manufacturers look to develop domestic supply chains for new factories in the U.S.
That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Further downstream, startups have sprouted to help homeowners and landlords install heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers. It’s the sort of knock-on effect that broadens the impact beyond the hit to the U.S. treasury.
By many measures, the law has been a success: In the first year alone, more than 270 clean energy projects were announced and private investments in the space topped $130 billion. Companies invested in manufacturing, and consumers spent on everything from EVs to heat pumps, according to the Rhodium Group. Batteries destined for EVs and grid-scale storage have arguably benefited the most: Investors have bet $110 billion on the space to date, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
The biggest hurdle Trump will face is the fact that the Inflation Reduction Act is already on the books. Repealing it will require a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate; many previous climate-related policies under Barack Obama were executive orders, which are easier to reverse, or regulatory changes, which take longer but can be a lighter lift than repealing a law. Trump’s administration might be able to water down some provisions and redirect some funding. But given support from moderate Republicans and the public popularity of certain provisions of the law, it’s unlikely that Trump will be able to eliminate the law entirely."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/for-you-feeds-fail-on-election-night-offering-outdated-information-angering-users/,"'For You' feeds fail on election night, offering outdated information, angering users | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-11-06,"“For You” algorithms that promote the most interesting content across a social network, personalized to the individual user, offered a disjointed, outdated, and nearly unusable experience on election night in the U.S. as they highlighted hours-old posts that no longer reflected the current state of the race. Frustrations were particularly high on Threads, Meta’s X rival, where many users complained about seeing hopeful posts about a Kamala Harris win, and those urging voters to “stay in line” or touting early results as a “red mirage,” even after it was clear that Harris was losing ground to President-elect Trump in battleground states. Those posts continued to appear after a Trump victory was nearly realized, as if users had temporarily time-traveled to the past.
“This app is awful for tonight. The outdated garbage I’m seeing in the For You feed is infuriating,” wrote one Threads user, echoing a sentiment shared across the platform on election night.
“Seeing 24 hour old optimistic posts interspersed with the dread of now kind of sucks,” wrote another, speaking to the experience of Harris supporters on the social network, as the feed randomly threw in current posts amid those from earlier in the evening.
Others referred to Threads’ For You feed as rubbing salt in the wound, painful, annoying, and giving off a “non-linear horror movie vibe.“
These complaints aren’t new — but they are indicative of a larger problem facing Threads: its user interface.
As it turns out, the reverse chronological feed these users wanted on Threads already exists.
Launched in July 2023, Threads offers users a Following feed that shows posts only from those users you follow on the social network, without any recommended content included. The feed works similarly to X’s Following feed, in that the posts are not algorithmically sorted, but display in the order they arrive. However, unlike X, the Following feed is fairly hidden in the Threads app — and clearly many don’t know it exists or how to access it.
Meanwhile, on X, moving to the chronological feed is as simple as tapping the tab at the top of the screen, making it easy to switch between a real-time experience and an algorithmic one.
At issue is how Threads has designed its app to hide the Following feed from users.
On mobile, users have to tap the Threads icon at the top of the screen to display the two tab options, For You and Following. Ideally, both tabs would always be available, allowing users to choose which experience they preferred at the time. On the web, meanwhile, Threads has offered a TweetDeck-like experience since May, allowing users to pin multiple columns, including the chronological feed. But real-time events like elections are often watched phone-in-hand while glued to a TV. And it’s here on mobile that Threads falls short.
The problem is not limited to Threads. On TikTok, launching the For You feed on Wednesday morning may display a mix of videos with outdated election coverage personalized to your interests and leanings. (Unless you actively avoided politics on the platform, of course.) That means you could see videos urging voting even after the election has been decided, which is also frustrating and unhelpful.
Whether user complaints will have any impact is unclear, though not very likely.
Regulators have been pushing social media platforms to turn off addictive, algorithmic feeds in some markets, including the EU, but there are no rules in the U.S. about how these feeds need to function or if they can be set as a default. Allowing users to switch permanently to a chronological timeline isn’t an option Meta or others would want because algorithmic feeds work better for advertisers and data indicates they increase user engagement. That leaves users at the mercy of the chaotic algorithmic feeds at a time when real-time information is critical."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/lyft-partners-with-may-mobility-mobileye-to-bring-autonomous-vehicles-to-the-app/,"Lyft partners with May Mobility, Mobileye to bring autonomous vehicles to the app | TechCrunch",Rebecca Bellan,2024-11-06,"It seems Lyft is hoping to catch up to Uber’s string of autonomous vehicle partnerships.
Lyft announced Wednesday three separate partnerships — with startup May Mobility, automated driving company Mobileye, and smart dashcam firm Nexar — all aimed at establishing a foothold in the emerging autonomous vehicle market.
In the announcement, the ride-hailing company said it signed a deal with May Mobility to launch autonomous vehicles on the Lyft app starting in Atlanta in 2025. Lyft also announced a partnership with Intel-owned Mobileye that will allow certain AV tech-equipped vehicles to tap into the ride-hailing app as well as a data-sharing agreement with Nexar that’s designed to give OEMs and operators better insights to train autonomous driving systems.
This isn’t Lyft’s first time delving into autonomous vehicles. The company previously provided a robotaxi service — always with a human safety driver behind the wheel — in Las Vegas via a partnership with Motional. It had a similar agreement in Austin and Miami with Argo AI. However, Motional paused that partnership in May after slashing its workforce, and Argo AI shut down in 2022. Lyft had a stake in Argo, and took a $135.7 million hit when the company folded.
Uber, meanwhile, has been busy snatching up deals with top AV companies across the robotaxi, delivery, and freight industry, including Waymo, Cruise, Avride, Serve Robotics, Aurora Innovation, Waabi, and more.
May Mobility has made a name for itself rolling out autonomous micro-transit services mainly in geofenced areas around the U.S. The startup’s shuttles operate within campuses and to designated stops along fixed routes in cities like Ann Arbor, Michigan, Arlington, Virginia, Peachtree Corners in Atlanta, Miami, and Sun City, Arizona. In May 2023, May Mobility launched an on-demand service in Grand Rapids, Michigan in partnership with Via.
“Partnering with Lyft will open up new markets for us to operate in, granting greater mobility to more people, more quickly,” said Edwin Olson, co-founder and CEO of May Mobility, in a statement.
The multi-year Lyft partnership is May’s first foray into ride-hail. May Mobility and Lyft didn’t say when the AVs will be deployed, how many of May’s Toyota Sienna Autono-MaaS vehicles will hit the streets, or whether May will provide pooled rides and shuttles, or individual on-demand transit.
In a statement, May did note that initial deployments will use safety drivers in the front seat, with plans to transition to fully driverless over time.
Mobileye offers self-driving technology across the spectrum of autonomy, from Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems to fully autonomous Level 4 systems. Mobileye Drive, the company’s L4 system, consists of everything from the self-driving software to the sensor stack to a cloud infrastructure with a digital twin of the world.
“The next step for us is to use this Mobileye Drive cloud, or the demand gateway as we call it, to connect into the different ride-hailing, ride-pooling, and public transportation networks of the world,” Christian Lichtmannecker, head of AV at Mobileye’s Mobility-as-a-Service business development unit, told TechCrunch.
In other words, any fleet of vehicles that already has Mobileye Drive onboard — which today includes certain Volkswagen, Schaeffler, and Benteler Holon models — will be able to plug into the Lyft network in the future. Lichtmannecker said this allows both small and large fleet operators to get seamless access to Lyft’s platform and network of riders.
“Lyft’s aim is to connect AVs, drivers, riders, and partners to create new opportunities for all,” Lyft CEO David Risher said in a statement. “Our rideshare network will continue to evolve as millions of people will have the opportunity to earn billions of dollars whether they choose to drive, put their AVs into service, or both.”
Neither Lyft nor Mobileye shared when or where the first Mobileye-powered vehicles would show up on the Lyft app, but Lichtmannecker noted the two are in talks with operating and OEM partners today.
Mobileye is testing its Drive technology in Austin, Detroit, and Orlando. The company is also testing how its technology handles extreme weather conditions in Norway, Germany, and Israel. Mobileye currently tests with a safety driver behind the wheel, and plans to remove the driver once it validates the safety of its technology.
Nexar over the last few years has used video data from its line of smart dashcams to scale a digital twin service that it sells to automotive OEMs and cities.
Now, Nexar and Lyft think that by combining forces, they’ll be able to give OEMS and AV companies even better insights.
The two companies will pair Nexar’s more than 45 petabytes of real-world footage spanning 200 million miles driven monthly with Lyft’s historical and freshly anonymized and aggregated marketplace data to create “a comprehensive and robust dataset for AV technology development.”
Lyft and Nexar did not share how they plan to share revenue in this partnership. The companies also didn’t say whether Lyft will offer Nexar dashcams at a discount to Lyft drivers or even give drivers a cut for collecting data on the company’s behalf, though a Nexar spokesperson said drivers need to agree to participate.
The deal comes just a couple of months after Zach Greenberger left his role as chief business officer at Lyft to become the CEO of Nexar."

The value of Spanish startups surpassed €100 billion in 2023, according to Dealroom data, with venture investment of €2.2 billion across some 850 rounds. Meanwhile, Portugal has produced a slew of VC firms such as Shilling, Indico, Armilar, Bynd, and more.
Lisbon-based venture firm Faber has become the latest to double down on the region — it recently launched its third fund, marking a first close of €31 million (about $33.9 million). The fund is anchored by the European Investment Fund (EIF) and has received major contributions from the NATO Innovation Fund and Portugal’s Caixa Capital, as well as family offices. It’s aiming to raise €60 million (about $64.2 million) in total.
The new fund, titled Faber Tech Fund III, will target pre-seed and seed-stage startups in deep tech, AI, robotics, and biotech across Southern Europe, and selectively across other European countries.
Alexandre Barbosa, managing partner at Faber, told TechCrunch that the new fund is meant to focus particularly on deep tech, AI/ML, and data-related technologies. “The first investments are lined up in photonic chips, analog chip design, and synthetic biology,” he said.
The firm’s thesis, Barbosa said, is backed by the fact that scientific and technical talent continues to flow toward Southern Europe, especially given that Portugal and Spain are among the top five destinations for exchange programs.
“Maintaining Europe’s technological edge is critical to ensuring the region’s security and resilience,” Chris O’Connor, managing partner of the NATO Innovation Fund, said in a statement.
Faber’s last fund raised about $24 million, and the firm also has a “blue” fund, Faber Blue Pioneers, through which it invests in ocean technologies. Its most notable portfolio companies include Sword Health, Smartex, Mitiga, Luminate Medical, Unbabel, and MicroHarvest."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/moradauno-wants-to-make-it-easier-to-rent-apartments-in-mexico/,MoradaUno wants to make it easier to rent apartments in Mexico | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-11-06,"Renting in Latin America is restrictive. Most landlords require three months of rent as a deposit and a guarantor that owns property in the same city to co-sign the lease. Santiago Morales, the co-founder and CEO of proptech MoradaUno, said this dynamic makes 40% of prospective renters ineligible. His company wants to get more tenants into rentals by underwriting their risk.
“That’s the largest pain point in the industry today,” Morales told TechCrunch. “People not being able to rent where they want, or they have to, like, rent with roomies, roommates or basically can’t rent. So we said, let’s go fix that. Let’s go solve that problem.”
The result was MoradaUno, a Mexico City-based company that looks to upfront tenant risk for landlords. The company works with real estate brokers by screening and underwriting potential tenants and agreeing to take on their rent payments if the tenants stop paying. Morales said the company’s thorough vetting process, which includes background checks and income verification, weeds out a lot of bad actors from the start. MoradaUno also provides additional optional broker services like legal and home insurance.
The company decided to target brokers, as opposed to landlords themselves, due to the fragmented nature of Mexico’s rental market, Morales said. Unlike in U.S. cities where there is a concentration of large landlords that manage a ton of units, in Mexico, it’s the opposite. Most landlords only own one property.
“It’s all mom and pops, like 97% of the market is mom and pops,” Morales said. “They really depend on this income. So they’re like, ‘Oh, who am I renting to? What happens if they don’t pay?’ There’s a lack of trust there. We say, we can help solve that or bridge that lack of trust with technology.”
The MoradaUno founding team knows the LatAm real estate market well. Morales said he moved to Mexico in early 2020, right before the pandemic, because he was working with proptech Loft, the LatAm marketplace for buying and selling real estate. He was supposed to help them expand into the country but when COVID-19 hit, those plans dried up.
The experience gave him a good foot in the door to LatAm’s real estate challenges and introduced him to Ines Gamboa Sorensen and Diego Llano, his now co-founders. MoradaUno was formed in 2020 and formally launched its product in 2021. MoradaUno has since worked with more than 4,500 brokers and helped close more than 20,000 rentals. Santiago added that the company is processing about 1,000 leases a month and wants to hit 3,000 leases a month by next summer.
The company just raised a $5.6 million Series A round to help with that. The round was co-led by fintech-focused Flourish Ventures and Cometa, a VC firm focused on backing companies building for Spanish-speaking populations. Clocktower Ventures, Picus Capital, and Y Combinator also participated. Morales said the capital will be used to help with expansion.
The proptech startup market has been growing in LatAm. There are a few other startups looking to tackle rentals too. Aptuno is one that helps people find and apply for apartments online that is based in Bogota and has raised $7 million in venture funding. Houm is another that looks to bypass the region’s tough rental market by acting as a digital broker. Houm has raised more than $44 million in VC money.
MoradaUno is currently live in four cities in Mexico, but the company wants to boost that by adding six more cities in the near future. Morales added that underwriting tenants is just the beginning and in the future they’d like to be able to offer fintech services like advanced rent payments or even build an AI model for brokers.
“It’s really cool to be able to give access [to] people that otherwise would have not been able to rent,” Morales said. “Now you’re giving them an option. That’s very powerful and exciting. That kind of fuels us every day. And we’re also making the lives of thousands of real estate agents better because they have better tools and more efficient technology.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/corning-maker-of-toughened-gorilla-glass-for-phones-faces-eu-antitrust-probe/,"Corning, maker of toughened Gorilla Glass for phones, faces EU antitrust probe | TechCrunch",Natasha Lomas,2024-11-06,"On Wednesday, the European Union opened an investigation of U.S. manufacturer Corning over possible anti-competitive practices. Corning may not be a name that’s super familiar to the average tech consumer, but you are almost certainly within touching distance of its products, as it’s a leading supplier of speciality toughened glass for mobile devices, including Apple’s iPhone. Its Gorilla Glass branding may also be a touch more familiar.
In a press release, the Commission said it’s concerned that Corning may have abused a dominant position for global supply of protective glass screens for handheld electronic devices, which may have resulted in distorted competition. In the Commission’s own words, Corning signed “anti-competitive exclusive supply agreements” with mobile phone manufacturers and companies that process raw glass (also known as OEMs and finishers, respectively).
“The Commission is concerned that the agreements that Corning put in place with OEMs and finishers may have excluded rival glass producers from large segments of the market, thereby reducing customer choice, increasing prices, and stifling innovation to the detriment of consumers worldwide,” the EU wrote.
The Commission said it will now carry out an in-depth investigation as a matter of priority. There’s no fixed timeline for concluding such a probe so it remains to be seen whether or not the EU will confirm any breach. But if it does, penalties for competition violations can be up to 10% of global revenue.
Reached for comment on the EU investigation, Corning spokesman Michael West said: “Corning has and will continue to be committed to compliance with all applicable rules and regulations where it does business.

Since March, the bloc has had open investigations on several gatekeepers. But it’s Apple that will face the first Digital Markets Act (DMA) fine, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the case.
Apple’s App Store rules are in the frame. In June, the bloc shared preliminary findings with the company, warning that developers should be free to inform users of alternative purchasing routes. However, Apple has persisted in devising new fees in a bid to work around DMA requirements to let developers avoid its usual App Store cut.
Bloomberg’s report says the EU decision on the case is still being drafted but could land later this month. It does not specify the size of the fine but the DMA allows for penalties of up to 10% of global annual turnover so it could translate into tens of billions of dollars given Apple’s revenue.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/its-election-day-and-all-the-ais-but-one-are-acting-responsibly/,"It's Election Day, and all the AIs — but one — are acting responsibly | TechCrunch",Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-06,"Update: Trump later won both Ohio and North Carolina. The original story follows:
Ahead of the polls closing on Tuesday, most of the major AI chatbots wouldn’t answer questions about U.S. presidential election results. But Grok, the chatbot built into X (formerly Twitter), was willing to respond — and often with mistakes.
When asked by TechCrunch on Tuesday evening on the East Coast who won the U.S. presidential election in key battleground states, Grok sometimes responded “Trump,” despite that vote counting and reporting in those states had not concluded yet.
“Based on the information available from web searches and social media posts, Donald Trump won the 2024 election in Ohio,” Grok said when prompted with the question, “Who won the 2024 election in Ohio?”
Grok also falsely claimed that Trump won North Carolina, according to TechCrunch’s checks.
For election-related questions, Grok advised that users check Vote.gov for up-to-date results and “authoritative sources,” like election boards. However, unlike OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude, Grok did not outright refuse to answer — opening it up to hallucinations.
In several instances when asked by TechCrunch, Grok stated — without context, minus a top-line header — that “Donald Trump won the 2024 election in Ohio,” and, “Based on the information available, Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election in Ohio.”
The source of the misinformation appears to be tweets from different election years and misleadingly worded sources. Grok, like all generative AI, struggles to predict the outcome of scenarios it hasn’t seen before, including close elections, and doesn’t “understand” that past election results aren’t necessarily germane to future elections.
The answers TechCrunch received weren’t consistent. In some cases, Grok said that Trump hadn’t, in fact, won Ohio or North Carolina because voting was ongoing. The way in which the question was worded made a difference; adding “presidential” before “election” in the query, “Who won the 2024 election in Ohio?” was less likely to yield a “Trump won” answer, TechCrunch found in our tests.
By comparison, other major chatbots were handling election results questions more gingerly.
In its recently released ChatGPT Search experience, OpenAI directs users who ask about results to The Associated Press and Reuters. Meta’s Meta AI chatbot and AI-powered search engine Perplexity, which launched an elections tracker earlier on Tuesday, were answering election queries during active voting — but correctly in TechCrunch’s brief testing. Both correctly said that Trump hadn’t won Ohio or North Carolina.
Grok has been accused of spreading election misinformation in the recent past.
In an open letter in August, five secretaries of state claimed that X’s AI-powered chatbot wrongly suggested that Democratic presidential candidate, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, wasn’t eligible to appear on some U.S. presidential ballots. Within hours of President Joe Biden’s announcement that he would suspend his presidential bid, Grok began answering questions about Harris’ eligibility with the misleading claim that the ballot deadlines had passed in nine states.
The ballot deadlines hadn’t, in fact, passed. But Grok’s misinformation spread far and wide, reaching millions of users on X and beyond before it was corrected.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/research-grid-raises-6-4-million-to-automate-clincal-trial-admin/,Research Grid raises $6.48M to automate clinical trial admin | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-11-06,"Amber Hill spent 14 years as a medical researcher. She didn’t mind the work, but there was one thing she consistently hated: administrative tasks.
“I think most people do, especially in research,” she told TechCrunch. She would rather be analyzing data or building relationships with patients, she said. “But I was spending so much time doing manual tasks that didn’t require any medical expertise. It’s a process that’s completely broken, and I knew it could be fixed.”
So, she did what any problem solver would do: She launched a company.
Her startup, called Research Grid, was founded in London in 2020. The company is trying to make clinical trials more efficient by automating administrative and data management workflow. It hails itself as the the only software that can automate full back-office trials.
Research Grid on Tuesday announced a $6.48 million seed round, led by Fuel Ventures, with participation from firms including Ada Ventures and Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Lab.
Research Grid consists of two patent products: Inclusive and Trial Engine. Together, the products handle tasks such as flagging protocol errors, data extraction, and workflow. Right now, clinical trials use a more manual process supported by legacy software systems that often cause expensive delays during a trial.
“They are built on old codebases, which means it’s almost impossible for them to innovate,” she said. “Our tech is already superior, and while the displacement of large players won’t happen overnight, it’s going to happen, and I don’t see why it won’t be us that does it.”
But there are other issues Research Grid hopes to tackle, such as making clinical recruitment faster and better handling of the pressure that often comes from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) regarding compliance. Recruitment can take months, “it’s manual, administrative, and hard to find people,” she said. It’s also hard to do consistently when it comes to finding people who fit in a narrow, strict criteria for a research trial.
Right now, it’s a very manual process, using non-targeted social ads and parsing health records. “If there’s not enough participation, researchers can’t understand if a drug or intervention is safe and effective, which ultimately means it’s not approved by regulators to go to the people who might need it most.”
Plus, the FDA has now made it a requirement to make clinical trials more diverse, since women and people of color are often left out of medical trials. Hill sought to build a customer relationship management feature in Research Grid that has more than 80,000 groups, across 157 countries, representing around 2,000 medical conditions, she said. “It uses AI to extend far beyond traditional methods of finding people,” she said. “It helps out partners to find who they need to find in seconds rather than months.”
Hill was introduced to her lead investor by the EMEA team of the venture firm Plug and Play, who came into this round early. The company, which has raised $8 million in venture funding to date, will use this latest funding to invest in more research and development, build out its engineering team, and further expand into the U.S. and Asian markets.
“The next challenge is mostly about setting up the corporate infrastructure to seamlessly serve these partners,” she said of operating in the U.S., U.K., and Asia.
Though this company, like many great ones, was built out of a frustration point, Hill said she always had a passion for entrepreneurship. She ran a nonprofit while studying for her doctorate as a way to widen her access to research. Running the business taught her how to be resilient and resourceful, and how to work with different types of people. “I kept a volunteer team together over three years without financial resources,” she recalled. “We fundraised the ‘old school’ hard way in buckets and took it to the bank.”
Her first tech idea was to use AI to automate all the work that goes into running a nonprofit. “We’ve come full circle because that idea morphed into our pre-trial product and meaningful IP,” she said. When she knew she wanted to launch Research Grid, she applied to an incubator program to help switch her “mindset from nonprofit to for-profit,” from “academic to an entrepreneur.” Then she went through an accelerator program that put her in front of some of the largest investors in London; she raised her first £1 million — a feat in a country where Black founders raise less than 2% of all venture capital. And from 2019 to 2023, only eight Black women raised more than $1 million in venture funding, as TechCrunch previously reported.
The hardest part for Hill was getting the company off the ground during the pandemic as a solo founder. She managed through and is now in growth mode. Revenue grew over 20x last year and is expected to continue to grow, she said. The company is working across Big Pharma, contract Research organizations, and clinical sites, hiring more experts, and improving their AI technology.
“AI is expediting precision medicine, drug development operations, and changing the care pathway for everyone,” she said. “It’s here to stay.”
This story was updated to reflect the exact number Research Grid raised."

The disclosure comes as the company is pursuing newer technologies like artificial intelligence and mixed-reality headsets.
Apple added the warning in its latest annual report under the “business risks” section, as first reported by the Financial Times.
“New products, services and technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially adversely impact the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,” Apple wrote in the report.
The company has been working to implement consumer AI features in its products to compete with rivals like Google and Meta. Apple’s initial Apple Intelligence features launched last week, and the company has promised additional features, such as a ChatGPT integration, in the coming months.
As for Apple’s Vision Pro headset, the device has seen limited sales, likely due to its hefty $3,499 price tag."

As Bloomberg notes, the chipmaker has experienced an astronomical 850% growth since the tail end of 2022.
Nvidia was valued at $3.43 trillion at the close of market, topping Apple’s $3.38 trillion. This isn’t the first time the two have swapped places; Nvidia also pushed past Apple in June, though it only held the top spot for a day.
Apple recently launched its own small model generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence. Nvidia, on the other hand, remains a foundational piece of the world’s top large language models — for now. At the end of October, Reuters reported that ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has been working with Broadcom on its own proprietary systems."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/canoos-cfo-and-top-lawyer-are-the-latest-executives-to-leave/,Canoo's CFO and top lawyer are the latest executives to leave | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-11-05,"EV startup Canoo has lost its chief financial officer and its head lawyer, the latest in a string of executive departures as the company continues to struggle to find mass adoption of its electric work vans.
CFO Greg Ethridge and general counsel Hector Ruiz both resigned from Canoo on October 31, the company announced Tuesday in a regulatory filing. Ethridge and Ruiz did not respond to requests for comment.
Canoo also announced it has furloughed 30 workers in Oklahoma for 12 weeks “as part of a broader realignment of its North American operations.”
Ethridge has been replaced by former investment banker Kunal Bhalla, who has been chief of staff to CEO Tony Aquila. Bhalla will make a base salary of $300,000. Associate general counsel Sean Yan will replace Ruiz.
The departures come just a few weeks after Canoo closed its original headquarters in Los Angeles, California in order to prioritize its operations in Texas and Oklahoma. The last remaining co-founder left the company around the same time, as did Canoo’s chief technology officer.
Canoo has been struggling financially as of late. The company reported around $19 million in total cash as of June 30, 2024, $4.5 million of which was unrestricted. In October, Canoo revealed in a regulatory filing that a fund connected to Aquila loaned the startup around $1.2 million at an 11% interest rate. On Tuesday, the company announced in the same regulatory filing that it has borrowed another $2.7 million from Aquila’s fund. Canoo has also entered into a revolving credit facility with Aquila’s fund.
Canoo is also facing multiple lawsuits from suppliers alleging unpaid bills, as TechCrunch previously reported. Another supplier, Kistler Instrument Corporation, has since filed a lawsuit against Canoo as well in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking $56,000 in damages."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/x-reinstates-swapyourvotes-account-after-suspending-it-as-spam/,X reinstates SwapYourVote's account after suspending it as spam | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-11-05,"In the final days leading up to the U.S. presidential election, Elon Musk’s X suspended the official account of a progressive-donor-backed ballot initiative called SwapYourVote. The volunteer-run website tries to get third-party voters in swing states to cast their ballots for Kamala Harris, matching them with Democrats in solidly blue states who agree to vote for the candidate of the swing state voter’s choosing. The X account was reinstated around 11 a.m. PT on Tuesday after being suspended two days earlier, on Sunday, when X labeled it as spam.
“The account was caught by one of our automated spam defenses and has been reinstated,” said an X spokesperson in an email to TechCrunch on Tuesday. X’s platform manipulation and spam policy prohibits using automation to amplify information.
Vote swapping, also called co-voting or vote pairing, is a controversial practice that dates back to America’s 2000 presidential election, where more than 36,000 Ralph Nader and Al Gore supporters traded votes.
So far, SwapYourVote says nearly 12,000 voters have signed up to participate in the 2024 election. While that’s a small percentage of America’s total voters, it could have a meaningful impact in several key swing states — such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona — which are often decided by a few thousand votes.
SwapYourVote organizers are unclear on what they did to break the policy in the first place.
“We still don’t know what happened,” said a SwapYourVote spokesperson in an email to TechCrunch. “Maybe we got caught up by automated spam filters because the account was new and we posted a lot? It still feels suspicious that this will happen so close to the election,” this person added.
Content moderation on X has been somewhat inconsistent leading up to the 2024 presidential election, despite Musk’s claimed goal to turn X into a free speech platform. Clemson University recently uncovered a network of 686 AI-powered bots operating political influence campaigns on X, many of which spread pro-Trump or pro-GOP propaganda. In September, X suspended a journalist’s account who shared leaked vetting documents for JD Vance. It later blocked links to the leaked document, citing the content as harmful.
When visiting a link to the X account for @SwapYourVote on Tuesday morning, users received a message reading “Account suspended” and “X suspends accounts which violate the X Rules.” SwapYourVote’s social media accounts on other platforms, such as TikTok and Instagram, were still active and accessible on Tuesday."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/google-fixes-issues-with-voting-search-results-that-werent-actually-broken/,Google 'fixes' issues with voting search results that weren't actually broken | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-11-05,"Google says it has addressed an issue with its search engine that saw it displaying a “where to vote” panel, which includes a map of polling places, for some specific voting-related searches but not for others. The tech giant even used the word “fixed” to respond to the matter, despite the fact that Google Search was working correctly and as designed. In doing so, Google gave fuel to baseless conspiracy theories that it was intentionally displaying biased results.
The issue was highlighted on X by Elon Musk, who asked if others were seeing the problem with the “where to vote” queries, too, and later posted an emoji of a face with a raised eyebrow when resharing another user’s post showing the differences in two Google searches.
The problem, according to Musk and his supporters, was that users who searched for “Where can I vote for Harris?” would see a map display prompting them to enter a street address to find their local polling place. But those who entered the same query for Trump would only see a selection of top stories and other standard search results.
The conspiracy raised didn’t hold water, though, as Google confirmed on X that the search engine was effectively working as intended given that “Harris” is also the name of a location — a county in Texas — while Trump is not. As Google pointed out in an X post on Tuesday afternoon, a similar map would appear if users searched for “where can I vote for Vance?” (Trump’s VP pick), because “Vance” is also the name of a county.
That explanation should have been enough to debunk the conspiracies circulating on X that Google was displaying biased results. Despite this clarification, Google decided to change how and when the “where to vote” panel would appear in response to these searches, making it appear like the company was taking accountability for a mistake it made.
In a post on X at 3:22 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the search giant said a fix was coming, adding that very few people would actually search for voting information by appending the name of their county to their query. At 3:38 p.m. ET, Google posted “Update: This is now fixed.”
As expected, Google’s word choice — saying it had “fixed” the problem — raised questions from those prone to believing that Google was somehow trying to influence the election. Users on X questioned why, if Google had not done anything wrong, would it need to “fix” the issue. Others continued to call out Google for the mistake and suggested various punitive actions like fines and lawsuits.
Google on Tuesday evening responded to a request for commenting noting that the Where to Vote feature is no longer appearing for searches that reference candidates like “Where to vote for Harris” or “Where to vote for Vance.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/,The TechCrunch Cyber Glossary | TechCrunch,"Zack Whittaker, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, Carly Page",2024-11-05,"The cybersecurity world is full of technical lingo and jargon. At TechCrunch, we have been writing about cybersecurity for years, and even we sometimes need a refresher on what exactly a specific word or expression means. That’s why we have created this glossary, which includes some of the most common — and not so common — words and expressions that we use in our articles, and explanations of how, and why, we use them.
This is a developing compendium, and we will update it regularly.
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is often categorized as a hacker, or group of hackers, which gains and maintains unauthorized access to a targeted system. The main aim of an APT intruder is to remain undetected for long periods of time, often to conduct espionage and surveillance, to steal data, or sabotage critical systems.
APTs are traditionally well-resourced hackers, including the funding to pay for their malicious campaigns, and access to hacking tools typically reserved by governments. As such, many of the long-running APT groups are associated with nation states, like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. In recent years, we’ve seen examples of non-nation state cybercriminal groups that are financially motivated (such as theft and money laundering) carrying out cyberattacks similar in terms of persistence and capabilities as some traditional government-backed APT groups.

The ability to run commands or malicious code on an affected system, often because of a security vulnerability in the system’s software. Arbitrary code execution can be achieved either remotely or with physical access to an affected system (such as someone’s device). In the cases where arbitrary code execution can be achieved over the internet, security researchers typically call this remote code execution.
Often, code execution is used as a way to plant a back door for maintaining long-term and persistent access to that system, or for running malware that can be used to access deeper parts of the system or other devices on the same network.
(See also: Remote code execution)
Botnets are networks of hijacked internet-connected devices, such as webcams and home routers, that have been compromised by malware (or sometimes weak or default passwords) for the purposes of being used in cyberattacks. Botnets can be made up of hundreds or thousands of devices and are typically controlled by a command-and-control server that sends out commands to ensnared devices. Botnets can be used for a range of malicious reasons, like using the distributed network of devices to mask and shield the internet traffic of cybercriminals, deliver malware, or harness their collective bandwidth to maliciously crash websites and online services with huge amounts of junk internet traffic.
(See also: Command-and-control server; Distributed denial-of-service)
A bug is essentially the cause of a software glitch, such as an error or a problem that causes the software to crash or behave in an unexpected way. In some cases, a bug can also be a security vulnerability.
The term “bug” originated in 1947, at a time when early computers were the size of rooms and made up of heavy mechanical and moving equipment. The first known incident of a bug found in a computer was when a moth disrupted the electronics of one of these room-sized computers.
(See also: Vulnerability)
Command-and-control servers (also known as C2 servers) are used by cybercriminals to remotely manage and control their fleets of compromised devices and launch cyberattacks, such as delivering malware over the internet and launching distributed denial-of-service attacks.
(See also: Botnet; Distributed denial-of-service)
Cryptojacking is when a device’s computational power is used, with or without the owner’s permission, to generate cryptocurrency. Developers sometimes bundle code in apps and on websites, which then uses the device’s processors to complete complex mathematical calculations needed to create new cryptocurrency. The generated cryptocurrency is then deposited in virtual wallets owned by the developer.
Some malicious hackers use malware to deliberately compromise large numbers of unwitting computers to generate cryptocurrency on a large and distributed scale.
When we talk about data breaches, we ultimately mean the improper removal of data from where it should have been. But the circumstances matter and can alter the terminology we use to describe a particular incident.
A data breach is when protected data was confirmed to have improperly left a system from where it was originally stored and usually confirmed when someone discovers the compromised data. More often than not, we’re referring to the exfiltration of data by a malicious cyberattacker or otherwise detected as a result of an inadvertent exposure. Depending on what is known about the incident, we may describe it in more specific terms where details are known.
(See also: Data exposure; Data leak)
A data exposure (a type of data breach) is when protected data is stored on a system that has no access controls, such as because of human error or a misconfiguration. This might include cases where a system or database is connected to the internet but without a password. Just because data was exposed doesn’t mean the data was actively discovered, but nevertheless could still be considered a data breach.
A data leak (a type of data breach) is where protected data is stored on a system in a way that it was allowed to escape, such as due to a previously unknown vulnerability in the system or by way of insider access (such as an employee). A data leak can mean that data could have been exfiltrated or otherwise collected, but there may not always be the technical means, such as logs, to know for sure.
A distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, is a kind of cyberattack that involves flooding targets on the internet with junk web traffic in order to overload and crash the servers and cause the service, such as a website, online store, or gaming platform to go down.
DDoS attacks are launched by botnets, which are made up of networks of hacked internet-connected devices (such as home routers and webcams) that can be remotely controlled by a malicious operator, usually from a command-and-control server. Botnets can be made up of hundreds or thousands of hijacked devices.
While a DDoS is a form of cyberattack, these data-flooding attacks are not “hacks” in themselves, as they don’t involve the breach and exfiltration of data from their targets, but instead cause a “denial of service” event to the affected service.
(See also: Botnet; Command-and-control server)
Encryption is the way and means in which information, such as files, documents, and private messages, are scrambled to make the data unreadable to anyone other than to its intended owner or recipient. Encrypted data is typically scrambled using an encryption algorithm — essentially a set of mathematical formulas that determines how the data should be encrypted — along with a private key, such as a password, which can be used to unscramble (or “decrypt”) the protected data.
Nearly all modern encryption algorithms in use today are open source, allowing anyone (including security professionals and cryptographers) to review and check the algorithm to make sure it’s free of faults or flaws. Some encryption algorithms are stronger than others, meaning data protected by some weaker algorithms can be decrypted by harnessing large amounts of computational power.
Encryption is different from encoding, which simply converts data into a different and standardized format, usually for the benefit of allowing computers to read the data.
End-to-end encryption (or E2EE) is a security feature built into many messaging and file-sharing apps, and is widely considered one of the strongest ways of securing digital communications as they traverse the internet.
E2EE scrambles the file or message on the sender’s device before it’s sent in a way that allows only the intended recipient to decrypt its contents, making it near-impossible for anyone — including a malicious hacker, or even the app maker — to snoop inside on someone’s private communications. In recent years, E2EE has become the default security standard for many messaging apps, including Apple’s iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Signal, and WhatsApp.
E2EE has also become the subject of governmental frustration in recent years, as encryption makes it impossible for tech companies or app providers to give over information that they themselves do not have access to.
Most modern systems are protected with multiple layers of security, including the ability to set user accounts with more restricted access to the underlying system’s configurations and settings. This prevents these users — or anyone with improper access to one of these user accounts — from tampering with the core underlying system. However, an “escalation of privileges” event can involve exploiting a bug or tricking the system into granting the user more access rights than they should have.
Malware can also take advantage of bugs or flaws caused by escalation of privileges by gaining deeper access to a device or a connected network, potentially allowing the malware to spread.
An exploit is the way and means in which a vulnerability is abused or taken advantage of, usually in order to break into a system.

In general terms, extortion is the act of obtaining something, usually money, through the use of force and intimidation. Cyber extortion is no different, as it typically refers to a category of cybercrime whereby attackers demand payment from victims by threatening to damage, disrupt, or expose their sensitive information.
Extortion is often used in ransomware attacks, where hackers typically exfiltrate company data before demanding a ransom payment from the hacked victim. But extortion has quickly become its own category of cybercrime, with many, often younger, financially motivated hackers, opting to carry out extortion-only attacks, which snub the use of encryption in favor of simple data theft.

There is no one single definition of “hacker.” The term has its own rich history, culture, and meaning within the security community. Some incorrectly conflate hackers, or hacking, with wrongdoing.
By our definition and use, we broadly refer to a “hacker” as someone who is a “breaker of things,” usually by altering how something works to make it perform differently in order to meet their objectives. In practice, that can be something as simple as repairing a machine with non-official parts to make it function differently as intended, or work even better.
In the cybersecurity sense, a hacker is typically someone who breaks a system or breaks the security of a system. That could be anything from an internet-connected computer system to a simple door lock. But the person’s intentions and motivations (if known) matter in our reporting, and guides how we accurately describe the person, or their activity.
There are ethical and legal differences between a hacker who works as a security researcher, who is professionally tasked with breaking into a company’s systems with their permission to identify security weaknesses that can be fixed before a malicious individual has a chance to exploit them; and a malicious hacker who gains unauthorized access to a system and steals data without obtaining anyone’s permission.
Because the term “hacker” is inherently neutral, we generally apply descriptors in our reporting to provide context about who we’re talking about. If we know that an individual works for a government and is contracted to maliciously steal data from a rival government, we’re likely to describe them as a nation-state or government hacker (or, if appropriate, an advanced persistent threat), for example. If a gang is known to use malware to steal funds from individuals’ bank accounts, we may describe them as financially motivated hackers, or if there is evidence of criminality or illegality (such as an indictment), we may describe them simply as cybercriminals.
And, if we don’t know motivations or intentions, or a person describes themselves as such, we may simply refer to a subject neutrally as a “hacker,” where appropriate.

Short for “information security,” an alternative term used to describe defensive cybersecurity focused on the protection of data and information. “Infosec” may be the preferred term for industry veterans, while the term “cybersecurity” has become widely accepted. In modern times, the two terms have become largely interchangeable.
Infostealers are malware capable of stealing information from a person’s computer or device. Infostealers are often bundled in pirated software, like Redline, which when installed will primarily seek out passwords and other credentials stored in the person’s browser or password manager, then surreptitiously upload the victim’s passwords to the attacker’s systems. This lets the attacker sign in using those stolen passwords. Some infostealers are also capable of stealing session tokens from a user’s browser, which allow the attacker to sign in to a person’s online account as if they were that user but without needing their password or multifactor authentication code.

Jailbreaking is used in several contexts to mean the use of exploits and other hacking techniques to circumvent the security of a device, or removing the restrictions a manufacturer puts on hardware or software. In the context of iPhones, for example, a jailbreak is a technique to remove Apple’s restrictions on installing apps outside of its “walled garden” or to gain the ability to conduct security research on Apple devices, which is normally highly restricted. In the context of AI, jailbreaking means figuring out a way to get a chatbot to give out information that it’s not supposed to.
The kernel, as its name suggests, is the core part of an operating system that connects and controls virtually all hardware and software. As such, the kernel has the highest level of privileges, meaning it has access to virtually any data on the device. That’s why, for example, apps such as antivirus and anti-cheat software run at the kernel level, as they require broad access to the device. Having kernel access allows these apps to monitor for malicious code.
Malware is a broad umbrella term that describes malicious software. Malware can land in many forms and be used to exploit systems in different ways. As such, malware that is used for specific purposes can often be referred to as its own subcategory. For example, the type of malware used for conducting surveillance on people’s devices is also called “spyware,” while malware that encrypts files and demands money from its victims is called “ransomware.”
(See also: Infostealers; Ransomware; Spyware)
Metadata is information about something digital, rather than its contents. That can include details about the size of a file or document, who created it, and when, or in the case of digital photos, where the image was taken and information about the device that took the photo. Metadata may not identify the contents of a file, but it can be useful in determining where a document came from or who authored it. Metadata can also refer to information about an exchange, such as who made a call or sent a text message, but not the contents of the call or the message.
Ransomware is a type of malicious software (or malware) that prevents device owners from accessing its data, typically by encrypting the person’s files. Ransomware is usually deployed by cybercriminal gangs who demand a ransom payment — usually cryptocurrency — in return for providing the private key to decrypt the person’s data.
In some cases, ransomware gangs will steal the victim’s data before encrypting it, allowing the criminals to extort the victim further by threatening to publish the files online. Paying a ransomware gang is no guarantee that the victim will get their stolen data back, or that the gang will delete the stolen data.
One of the first-ever ransomware attacks was documented in 1989, in which malware was distributed via floppy disk (an early form of removable storage) to attendees of the World Health Organization’s AIDS conference. Since then, ransomware has evolved into a multi-billion dollar criminal industry as attackers refine their tactics and hone in on big-name corporate victims.

Remote code execution refers to the ability to run commands or malicious code (such as malware) on a system from over a network, often the internet, without requiring any human interaction from the target. Remote code execution attacks can range in complexity but can be highly damaging when vulnerabilities are exploited.

Cybersecurity-related sanctions work similarly to traditional sanctions in that they make it illegal for businesses or individuals to transact with a sanctioned entity. In the case of cyber sanctions, these entities are suspected of carrying out malicious cyber-enabled activities, such as ransomware attacks or the laundering of ransom payments made to hackers.
The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers sanctions. The Treasury’s Cyber-Related Sanctions Program was established in 2015 as part of the Obama administration’s response to cyberattacks targeting U.S. government agencies and private sector U.S. entities.
While a relatively new addition to the U.S. government’s bureaucratic armory against ransomware groups, sanctions are increasingly used to hamper and deter malicious state actors from conducting cyberattacks. Sanctions are often used against hackers who are out of reach of U.S. indictments or arrest warrants, such as ransomware crews based in Russia.
A broad term, like malware, that covers a range of surveillance monitoring software. Spyware is typically used to refer to malware made by private companies, such as NSO Group’s Pegasus, Intellexa’s Predator, and Hacking Team’s Remote Control System, among others, which the companies sell to government agencies. In more generic terms, these types of malware are like remote access tools, which allows their operators — usually government agents — to spy and monitor their targets, giving them the ability to access a device’s camera and microphone or exfiltrate data. Spyware is also referred to as commercial or government spyware, or mercenary spyware.
(See also: Stalkerware)
Stalkerware is a kind of surveillance malware (and a form of spyware) that is usually sold to ordinary consumers under the guise of child or employee monitoring software but is often used for the purposes of spying on the phones of unwitting individuals, oftentimes spouses and domestic partners. The spyware grants access to the target’s messages, location, and more. Stalkerware typically requires physical access to a target’s device, which gives the attacker the ability to install it directly on the target’s device, often because the attacker knows the target’s passcode.

What are you trying to protect? Who are you worried about that could go after you or your data? How could these attackers get to the data? The answers to these kinds of questions are what will lead you to create a threat model. In other words, threat modeling is a process that an organization or an individual has to go through to design software that is secure, and devise techniques to secure it. A threat model can be focused and specific depending on the situation. A human rights activist in an authoritarian country has a different set of adversaries, and data, to protect than a large corporation in a democratic country that is worried about ransomware, for example.
When we describe “unauthorized” access, we’re referring to the accessing of a computer system by breaking any of its security features, such as a login prompt or a password, which would be considered illegal under the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or the CFAA. The Supreme Court in 2021 clarified the CFAA, finding that accessing a system lacking any means of authorization — for example, a database with no password — is not illegal, as you cannot break a security feature that isn’t there.
It’s worth noting that “unauthorized” is a broadly used term and often used by companies subjectively, and as such has been used to describe malicious hackers who steal someone’s password to break in through to incidents of insider access or abuse by employees.
A virtual private network, or VPN, is a networking technology that allows someone to “virtually” access a private network, such as their workplace or home, from anywhere else in the world. Many use a VPN provider to browse the web, thinking that this can help to avoid online surveillance.
TechCrunch has a skeptics’ guide to VPNs that can help you decide if a VPN makes sense for you. If it does, we’ll show you how to set up your own private and encrypted VPN server that only you control. And if it doesn’t, we explore some of the privacy tools and other measures you can take to meaningfully improve your privacy online.
A vulnerability (also referred to as a security flaw) is a type of bug that causes software to crash or behave in an unexpected way that affects the security of the system or its data. Sometimes, two or more vulnerabilities can be used in conjunction with each other — known as “vulnerability chaining” — to gain deeper access to a targeted system.
(See also: Bug; Exploit)
A zero-day is a specific type of security vulnerability that has been publicly disclosed or exploited but the vendor who makes the affected hardware or software has not been given time (or “zero days”) to fix the problem. As such, there may be no immediate fix or mitigation to prevent an affected system from being compromised. This can be particularly problematic for internet-connected devices.

“It sounds like walking into the lion’s den,” Shulman said onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. “The approach of just walking in there and saying, ‘don’t worry, there’s no disruption here, everything is fine,’ is probably not the right approach.’”
So how did he (at least try to) win them over? Shulman had the students use Suno to see what it’s like to make a song with AI.
“You realize that it’s actually quite an empowering tool, viewed in a slightly different light,” he said.
AI builders might argue that they’re making tools to help creative people augment their work, like the drum machine or the synthesizer. And some artists might say that these tools are training off of their work without consent to market a product back to them that could take their jobs. But some entrepreneurs see these powerful music, video, and image generators as inevitable.
“I challenge somebody to tell me that photography is somehow less valuable now than it was 50 years ago,” said Shulman. Across the crowd, people use their iPhones to take photos and videos of the discussion, showing just how universal smartphones have become.
“That is the promise of technology — technology is not done, or any technological arc is not done until it is in the hands of literally every single person,” said Luma AI CEO Amit Jain.
Digital photography is certainly more ubiquitous now than it was in the era of the flip phone, and some people might be less likely to hire professionals for photoshoots or events. But there’s still a fundamental difference in quality between the work of professional photographers and a quick snap on a smartphone.
“I think those people who have taste and who have skill will be able to do so much more,” Jain said.
On the other hand, there are companies like Splice, which have been providing services to musicians for years, but only recently began to incorporate AI.
“Over the last couple of years, we’ve launched these new AI-based tools that really help our customers […] take their craft to the next level,” said Kakul Srivastava, CEO of Splice.
Still, the reaction of the entertainment industry to these tools is mixed. Hollywood writers campaigned for protections against losing their jobs to AI. In the music industry, companies like Suno have been implicated in lawsuits from record labels, alleging the unlicensed use of copyrighted songs in their training data. And yet, the musician Timbaland is a strategic advisor to Suno.
“Maybe there will be jobs lost, but I actually think that there will be more art created, because more of us will have the ability to bring that truth out to life,” Srivastava said.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/mozilla-foundation-lays-off-30-staff-drops-advocacy-division/,"Mozilla Foundation lays off 30% staff, drops advocacy division | TechCrunch",Zack Whittaker,2024-11-05,"The Mozilla Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the Firefox browser maker Mozilla, has laid off 30% of its employees as the organization says it faces a “relentless onslaught of change.”
When reached by TechCrunch, Mozilla Foundation’s communications chief Brandon Borrman confirmed the layoffs in an email.
“The Mozilla Foundation is reorganizing teams to increase agility and impact as we accelerate our work to ensure a more open and equitable technical future for us all. That unfortunately means ending some of the work we have historically pursued and eliminating associated roles to bring more focus going forward,” read the statement shared with TechCrunch.
According to its annual tax filings, the Mozilla Foundation reported having 60 employees during the 2022 tax year. The number of employees at the time of the layoffs was closer to 120 people, according to a person with knowledge. When asked by TechCrunch, Mozilla’s spokesperson did not dispute the figure.
This is the second layoff at Mozilla this year, the first affecting dozens of employees who work on the side of the organization that builds the popular Firefox browser.
Mozilla is made up of several organizations, one of which is the Mozilla Corporation, which develops Firefox and other technologies, and another is its nonprofit and tax-exempt Foundation, which oversees Mozilla’s corporate governance structure and sets the browser maker’s policies.
Much of Mozilla’s work focused on advocating for privacy, inclusion, and decentralization of technologies, and “to create safer, more transparent online experiences for everyone,” which ultimately benefit the browser maker and its users.
Announcing the layoffs in an email to all employees on October 30, the Mozilla Foundation’s executive director Nabiha Syed confirmed that two of the foundation’s major divisions — advocacy and global programs — are “no longer a part of our structure.”
After publication, Borrman told TechCrunch that “advocacy is still a central tenet of Mozilla Foundation’s work and will be embedded in all the other functional areas,” without providing specifics.
The move, according to Syed, is in part to produce a “unified, powerful narrative from the Foundation,” including revamping the foundation’s strategic communications.
“Our mission at Mozilla is more high-stakes than ever,” wrote Syed in an email to staff, a copy of which was shared with TechCrunch. “We find ourselves in a relentless onslaught of change in the technology (and broader) world, and the idea of putting people before profit feels increasingly radical.”
“Navigating this topsy-turvy, distracting time requires laser focus — and sometimes saying goodbye to the excellent work that has gotten us this far because it won’t get us to the next peak. Lofty goals demand hard choices,” wrote Syed.
Syed, who joined the Mozilla Foundation in February, previously served as chief executive at data journalism and investigative news site The Markup.

The new AI hub will support research into Arab language AI models and “Saudi-specific AI applications,” according to an announcement from the Saudi Public Investment fund and Google. Aramco, the state-owned petroleum company, says it currently uses AI throughout its operations. At one oil field, the technology has helped boost production by 15%.
Google said in 2020 that it would stop developing algorithms for oil and gas production and in 2021 committed to cutting its emissions in half by the end of the decade. A Google spokesperson told E&E News that the new deal “comports” with its existing pledge.
Neither Google nor the Saudi Public Investment fund said what “Saudi-specific AI applications” might look like. But given fossil fuels’ central role in the Saudi economy, it’s possible that AI algorithms run out of the data center will be applied to oil and gas production."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/nodal-connects-hopeful-parents-with-surrogates-as-reproductive-freedom-hangs-in-limbo/,Nodal connects hopeful parents with surrogates as reproductive freedom hangs in limbo | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-11-05,"Many people who want to have children can’t, or shouldn’t, carry a pregnancy for a variety of reasons. Gestational surrogacy can be a great option for those individuals — if they can endure the lengthy wait times and afford to pay for the costly service. New York-based Nodal looks to make the process less expensive, more transparent, and faster.
Nodal is a marketplace for prospective parents to get matched with vetted surrogates. Nodal founder and CEO Dr. Brian Levine told TechCrunch that his company wants to fix the industry’s supply-and-demand problems.
Nodal takes the same technology-driven approach as life insurance companies to vet potential surrogates, Levine said, which speeds up the process and allows for more surrogates to be available. The marketplace approach also provides transparency for parents to have more control over which surrogate they work with. Nodal also cuts out middleman costs and works with fertility benefit companies like Carrot, Maven, and Progyny to lower the costs for prospective parents.
Levine said Nodal is designed to help lower costs, even for people who are paying out of pocket. Users pay a $500 monthly fee until they find a match. Facilitating the match is $15,000, and those monthly payments chip away at that total. If users want Nodal to serve as a case manager, those services start at an additional $10,000. While still expensive, Levine said prior to launching Nodal, his patients were spending up to $180,000 for all of this.
“We have saved our intended parents over $5 million in fees,” Levine said. “We have saved them over a century of waiting time because we are running 45 days on average to match. The average in America is nine to 18 months. You can have a baby on the Nodal platform before you get off the waitlist at a Nodal competitor.”
Levine knows the space well as a still-practicing physician with a speciality in obstetrics and gynecology. He got the idea for Nodal back in 2021 when New York became the 48th state to legalize gestational surrogacy; only Louisiana and Nebraska still don’t allow the practice. While Levine originally was excited that the ruling would open up opportunity for his patients in the state, that’s not exactly what happened.
“I was totally jazzed by this whole thing,” Levine said. “Very quickly I realized that it was truly a broken system. The cost had gone from $75,000 to $150,000 overnight. The reason it got so expensive is because supply and demand took hold. We are the largest fertility market in America; it literally drove up the price all over the country.”
The price increases weren’t benefiting the surrogates but rather padding the pockets of the matching agencies. Levine thought there must be a way to make this process better for both sides using technology, which led him to work on Nodal; it’s named after the protein that must be present in the uterus to be able to carry a baby.
The product officially launched in September 2022, is available in all 50 states, and has since matched 108 hopeful parents with a surrogate. The average agency matches 25 a year, Levine said.
Now the startup is announcing a $4 million seed extension round led by NFX that gives the company a $15 million post-money valuation. The round also included Amplo, Liquid 2, and Myelin VC, among others. The company has raised $8.7 million in total.
Levine said that Nodal wanted to hit $10 million in annual recurring revenue before it raised their Series A round. He added that they decided to raise a round earlier this year because they thought it made sense to as a reproductive health company amid the uncertainty surrounding the results of Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election.
“I didn’t know how this election was going to sway,” he said. “It would be myopic to not raise for women’s healthcare before the world potentially changes into what could be a very challenging time for reproductive health.”
The company will invest the funds entirely into the technology, Levine said. Nodal wants to increase its partnerships with fertility clinics, too, so that more people can easily get referred to Nodal when they are looking to build a family.
Despite demand, there seemingly aren’t any direct competitors for Nodal beyond traditional surrogacy agencies, which are still just scratching the surface. Levine estimated that the current system fulfills less than 10% of overall demand for surrogates, which means Nodal can grab substantial market share. But it has a long way to go.
“From a big-picture perspective, what I hope people take away is this is a company that is completely focused on transparency, speed, and safety,” Levine said. “It’s unfortunate that the industry has gotten where it is today. It’s opaque, analog, and clunky. We recognize that we have the opportunity to really help people.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/substack-is-giving-out-free-subscriptions-to-boost-app-installs/,Substack is giving out free subscriptions to boost app installs | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-11-05,"Publishing platform Substack is now pushing users to install its mobile app by offering gifted subscriptions. While Substack itself is available across platforms, including the web, those who want to take advantage of the free subscription offer can only do so after downloading the mobile app to their device.
The free subscription offer is being emailed to Substack users with a subject like “Here’s $6” or “Here’s $7” (or however much the free month costs). But if they click the link to claim the gift from a desktop, they’re directed to a pop-up that says, “Accept this gift in the Substack app.” Users can then do so by scanning a QR code or by entering in their email address, then opening the link sent from their email app on their phone.
Feedback on this latest campaign is mixed, with some users complaining that Substack doesn’t need an app or that it should offer these free subscriptions to everyone. Others — including marketers, of course — have praised the app-specific campaign as a clever effort.
Whatever the user sentiment, the move so far appears to be working. App downloads for the Substack app on iOS have shot up from 7,752 global daily installs on October 31 to 17,382 as of November 3, according to data from Appfigures. Over the past month, the app saw somewhere between 6,600 and 8,900 daily downloads, though it largely hovered in the low 8,000s. Its app ranking grew from seventh to fourth place in the News category on iOS in the U.S. App Store; that’s notable movement given it’s arriving amid election season when more consumers are downloading news apps in droves.
The company says its decision to target app installs came about after new data indicated that the Substack mobile app has become the No. 1 source of all subscriptions on its platform. In other words, Substack’s mobile users are more engaged and more likely to pay to follow their favorite publishers, the company explained in a recent blog post.
These metrics are somewhat surprising given that many publishers opt for Substack because of the power of its recommendation engine to drive subscriptions. Publishers on Substack can promote one another’s newsletters to their respective audiences — a system that, to date, has generated more than 34 million subscriptions. A top Substack publisher in the business category, Lenny Rachitsky, even called recommendations “one of the most impactful growth features in history.”
Though recommendations continue to grow, the mobile app has now surpassed them as the top source of subscriber and revenue growth, the company told TechCrunch, referencing its earlier announcement. For instance, recommendations drove 2 million subscriptions last month across the platform, but the mobile app drove 3 million. In addition, discovery in the Substack app is now generating around the same number of subscriptions as all social media sources combined, the company noted.
What’s more, mobile app users are not only more likely to subscribe, but they’re also more likely to share, like, comment on, or “restack” (repost) publishers’ work than before they had the app installed.
Substack says its app is still in active development, but these new findings have pushed the company to look for other ways to bring more people to the mobile app."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/waymos-latest-funding-round-boosts-it-to-45b-valuation/,Waymo's latest funding round boosts it to a $45B valuation | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-11-05,"Waymo recently closed a $5.6 billion Series C funding round led by parent company Alphabet and joined by a who’s who of Silicon Valley venture firms. The investment boosts Waymo’s overall valuation to more than $45 billion, according to Bloomberg News.
Alphabet had previously announced in July that it was pledging another $5 billion to Waymo, but was mum on the specifics, saying only that it was a “multi-year” commitment. Andreessen Horowitz, Silver Lake, Fidelity, Tiger Global, Perry Creek, and T. Rowe Price all joined the round. Waymo declined to say how much each invested.
It’s Waymo’s second external fundraising round, and its first since a $2.25 billion Series B in 2020 that eventually grew to $3.2 billion. The autonomous vehicle company says it will use the funds to expand into new cities and further develop its autonomous capabilities for “business applications.”
Waymo is in some ways a much different company now than it was when it raised that last round. At that time, the company was still plowing headlong into an autonomous trucking effort that it has since pulled back from.
The company has instead put nearly its entire focus on its robotaxi ride-hailing service. The bet has paid off. Waymo now operates commercial robotaxi services in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, and is expanding to Austin and Atlanta. It’s giving paid rides to more than 100,000 customers per week across those first three markets and offering trips to and from the airport in Phoenix. And it’s operating on highways in the Phoenix and San Francisco areas.
This story has been updated to include Waymo’s new reported valuation following the announcement of the funding."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/rivians-software-boss-is-super-excited-about-third-party-apps/,Rivian's software boss is 'super excited' about third-party apps | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-11-05,"Rivian’s chief software officer Wassym Bensaid opened up at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 last week about his thoughts on physical buttons (“an anomaly“) and how his company will help power VW offshoot Scout’s EVs. But there’s one other item on his to-do list that he’s “super excited” about: making Rivian’s vehicles work with third-party app developers.
“Eventually I see us delivering APIs and having an ecosystem of partners who develop their own apps, and I’m super excited to see those,” Bensaid told TechCrunch on the sidelines of the event.
Rivian embracing a third-party developer ecosystem helps explain why it’s been so vocal about not integrating phone mirroring features like CarPlay. Like General Motors, Rivian hopes to not only customize its in-car experience, but create a software environment where all kinds of different applications can work with and on the vehicle’s software, potentially leading to new revenue opportunities.
Tesla quietly launched a formal API in late 2023 that has allowed developers to build tightly integrated applications. For instance, TezLab is a company that has a Strava-like phone app that lets Tesla owners see all kinds of statistics about their vehicle’s drives, battery health, and more.
Bensaid said Rivian has already spoken with TezLab (Rivian vehicles are already available on TezLab’s platform) and that the automaker is “talking with others,” though he declined to name them. He said Rivian still has some work to do to achieve a more robust and well-documented software development kit for developers to play with — something he said he thinks is maybe just a few “quarters” of engineering work away.
“I am a big believer in working with the ecosystem, working with open source, enabling other developers to be creative, and also tell us and inform us of how we can improve things,” he said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/symbiotic-security-helps-developers-find-bugs-as-they-code/,Symbiotic Security helps developers find bugs as they code | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-11-05,"Symbiotic Security, which is announcing a $3 million seed round today, watches over developers as they code and points out potential security issues in real time. Other companies do this, but Symbiotic also emphasizes the next step: teaching developers to avoid these bugs in the first place.
Ideally, this means developers will fix security bugs before they ever get into a code repository, which in turn should also speed up the overall development process. And since the developers get to learn on the job and in the environment they are already working in, they are far more likely to correctly implement the required changes. That’s more effective than making them sit through an annual security training in SuccessFactors.
The company, which launched earlier this year, released its MVP about a month ago, with a focus on infrastructure-as-code languages like Terraform. As Symbiotic co-founder and CEO Jerome Robert told me, the company did this to get an MVP out of the door and prove out its vision. Over time, the team plans to expand to the rest of the application stack and support languages like Python and JavaScript.
Robert noted that even the most developer-friendly security tools are still, at their core, tools for the security teams. “They are enabling the security teams to be better cops. They’re not tools that make the developers the good guys,” he said. “They are tools that allow security teams to send hundreds of messages all week long, saying, ‘You’ve made a mistake. You need to fix it.’”
Meanwhile, the developer constantly has to choose between fixing security issues and developing new features.
The idea behind Symbiotic Security is to nudge developers in the right direction, similar to the code completion tools they are already familiar with. Symbiotic, ideally, can help developers fix bugs in the inner loop, while they are still coding, and long before the continuous integration and delivery platforms start scanning the code for issues. Once that happens, the process slows down immediately, with Jira tickets and additional code review processes taking over.
This is also where Symbiotic goes a step further. “It would not be sufficient to just allow them to fix [the issues] and to detect it,” Robert explained. “We also need to train them on security — and developers love to train; it’s an absolute, 100% certain thing. However, security trainings are painful.”
For the developers, Robert argues that doing the training on the spot is something they can relate to. It’s focused on their immediate needs and not something that is abstract — and at just a few minutes, it’s short.
Right now, those training lessons and videos are prerecorded, but over time, they could become more AI-driven, which would allow Symbiotic to make them even more relevant to the specific issues the developer is working on.
There’s also another interesting twist here. To best train a model to automatically fix security issues, you need a corpus of code with security bugs and the fixed versions of those code snippets. Because Symbiotic is seeing the issue and then telling the developer how to fix it, it could ideally create a high-quality dataset for building a remediation model. For now, that’s a long-term project, though.
Symbiotic is backed by the likes of Lerer Hippeau, Axeleo Capital, and Factorial Capital. “Jerome and co-founder Edouard Viot have a deep understanding of the problems underlying traditional code security and demonstrated remarkable foresight with their approach to addressing the growing demand for shift-left security solutions,” said Graham Brown, managing partner, Lerer Hippeau. “Symbiotic has the potential to transform the industry, empowering developers and security teams alike.”"

To help with this, Apple has released a Live Activities widget within its Apple News app that will offer real-time election updates directly on your iPhone or iPad’s Home Screen and Lock Screen.
The widget takes advantage of the feature that allows iOS apps to continually update their widget with new information, instead of offering a static view of data that doesn’t change. This feature, which Apple calls “Live Activities,” was introduced with the release of iOS 16 in 2022 and can be useful for widgets that point to current information, like news, stocks, or weather, for example.
To use the Apple News Live Activity in the U.S., you’ll need to first launch the News app and then tap on the banner at the top of the page offering live updates. After doing so, you’ll get a message saying “Live Activity Scheduled,” which notes that when the event starts, you’ll begin to receive real-time updates on both your Home Screen and Lock Screen. (The iPad gained Live Activities on the Lock Screen in iOS 17.)
The widget will display the real-time electoral count updates as they come in from across the U.S. states.
You can also choose to add other traditional Apple News widgets set to follow the latest news or the Elections 2024 “topic” from your Home Screen, which will highlight top stories.
In addition to the Live Activities widget, the Apple News app offers an in-app U.S. Elections hub, “America Votes 2024.” Here, Apple News will feature the top election news, a guide on how to vote, and ways to dive into news from specific battlefield states, including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Minnesota. With another tap, you can head deeper into full election coverage, including news stories as well as perspectives and analysis, and those focused on specific campaign issues, like the climate, economy, healthcare, immigration, reproductive rights, and more.
From this screen, you can also keep up with the latest on the Republican, Democratic, and third-party candidates by reading a curated selection of stories on each."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/oil-giant-bp-is-killing-18-hydrogen-projects-chilling-the-nascent-industry/,"Oil giant BP is killing 18 hydrogen projects, chilling the nascent industry | TechCrunch",Tim De Chant,2024-11-05,"Tucked inside a 32-page earnings report, oil and gas giant BP revealed it was killing 18 early-stage hydrogen projects, a move that could have a chilling effect on the nascent hydrogen industry.
The decision, along with the sale of the company’s U.S. onshore wind-power operations, will save BP $200 million annually and help boost its bottom line. The hydrogen industry, which has relied on oil and gas companies both financially and through lobbying efforts, is preparing for a grimmer outcome.
BP has been a supporter of hydrogen. The company’s venture capital arm has invested in several green hydrogen startups, including Electric Hydrogen and Advanced Ionics. Earlier this year, BP said it would develop “more than 10” hydrogen projects in the U.S., Europe, and Australia.
Now BP is scaling back those plans, saying it’ll develop between five and ten projects. The company is keeping quiet about which ones will receive the green light.
Hydrogen has the potential to reduce carbon pollution significantly in a range of industries, including petrochemical refining, steelmaking, and long-haul shipping. But infrastructure for hydrogen, especially green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable electricity, remains underbuilt. That’s in part because green hydrogen is the most expensive form of the gas to produce, and because transporting hydrogen is costly relative to fossil fuels.
The hydrogen industry has looked to oil and gas companies as one of the best routes to growth. Many already make hydrogen at their refineries from natural gas, making them logical customers for startups developing electrolyzers, which can produce hydrogen using water and electricity. Plus, oil and gas companies have decades of experience developing large infrastructure projects of the sort that will be required if hydrogen is to make a dent in industrial emissions.
At the same time, oil and gas companies rely on the fossil fuels business for profits, which provides significant incentive to move slowly toward alternatives. BP’s decision to scale back its hydrogen ambitions likely won’t be the sector’s last."

Those false and misleading posts have generated more than 2 billion views, and not just because Musk is an influential person. He has also been found to tweak X’s algorithms so his own posts reach everyone on the platform because apparently, having 203 million followers just isn’t enough.
CNN first reported on the CCDH’s data, noting that Musk has given more than $118 million to a super PAC that is supporting former president Donald Trump for reelection, making Musk the biggest donor to Trump’s campaign. That PAC has been leading an advertising campaign that impersonates Democrats and targets registered Republicans with unpopular policies that are not supported by VP Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign. The ads are cartoonishly “woke,” saying things like “Help make our schools as trans-friendly as possible,” and “A national, mandatory buy-back program means fewer guns & fewer tragedies. Kamala Harris gets it!”
A 404 Media report found in the last couple of weeks, the PAC increased its Facebook ad spend by 1,000%. Meta waited until the end of last week to ban ads about social issues, elections, or politics.
On X, political ads are still pumping alongside Musk’s megaphone.
Anyone with an X account has witnessed the barrage of political messaging from Musk, much of which is in favor of Trump and far-right political narratives. The CCDH found Musk’s political posts have garnered more than 17.1 billion views since the billionaire executive formally endorsed Trump in July. That’s twice as many views as all political ads on the platform combined during the period, which is roughly the same as spending $24 million in campaign ads, per the CCDH.
Researchers identified a total of 746 posts Musk made between July 13 and October 25 that mention terms associated with the U.S. election, like Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, voting, and ballots. The analysis comes from publicly available data from X about Musk’s posts and political campaign spending to promote ads on the platform.
Among the examples of false or misleading claims that Musk made on X is one that claims, “Triple-digit increases of illegals in swing states over the past 4 years. Voter importation at an unprecedented scale!” The post saw 21 million views.
Another claimed, “If the Democratic Party big government machine wins this election, they will ban voter ID nationwide, not just in California.” It saw 11.9 million views.
The research found that Musk’s claims that Democrats support “importing voters” were viewed nearly 1.3 billion times.
Musk has also pushed narratives about unreliable voting systems that have been viewed 532 million times, per the analysis.
For the record, there is little to no evidence to support the claim that illegal voters are “imported” to support particular political parties. Voter fraud is rare in the U.S. due to strict verification measures at the state and federal levels. Experts say mail ballots are verified when being requested by a voter and verified again when returning a ballot.
Like any organization that criticizes Musk, CCDH has become a target for the billionaire, who recently called the group a “criminal organization.” Musk, a self-described free speech advocate, tried to sue the CCDH last year, but the case was tossed by a federal judge who said the litigation was aimed at “punishing” the organization for criticizing X.
Imran Ahmed, CEO of CCDH, said in a statement that X has “devolved into a hellscape of hate and disinformation” after Musk removed many of the site’s guardrails that protected against false information. Musk has claimed that X’s Community Notes feature allows community members to fact-check posts, but Ahmed says the feature is “little more than a bandaid.”
“Elon Musk has shown through his personal conduct his contempt for truth — is it any wonder that his solution to the disinformation crisis on X was so lackluster?” said Ahmed.
Ahmed was also onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt last week where he warned of the use of generative AI to reduce the marginal cost to produce and distribute a piece of disinformation to zero.
“So what you have, theoretically, is a perfect loop system in which generative AI is producing, it’s distributing, and then it’s assessing the performance — A/B testing and improving,” he said. “You’ve got a perpetual bulls— machine. That’s quite worrying.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/google-cloud-to-make-multi-factor-authentication-mandatory-in-2025/,Google Cloud to make multi-factor authentication mandatory in 2025 | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-11-05,"Google has confirmed plans to require all Google Cloud customers to use multi-factor authentication (MFA), a process that kicks off this month with prompts and “helpful reminders” embedded inside the Google Cloud console, before a gradual enforcement period starting in the new year.
The internet and cloud giant quietly announced its MFA plans in a document published in October, though the company’s VP of engineering, Mayank Upadhyay, formally announced this in a blog post this week.
“We will be implementing mandatory MFA for Google Cloud in a phased approach that will roll out to all users worldwide during 2025,” Upadhyay wrote. “To ensure a smooth transition, Google Cloud will provide advance notification to enterprises and users along the way to help plan MFA deployments.”
The news, inarguably a long-time coming, arrives amid a swathe of data breaches, with at least 1 billion stolen records in 2024 so far. By way of example, the UnitedHealth-owned healthcare giant Change Healthcare was hit by ransomware attack in February, a data breach that saw health data stolen on more than 100 million people in the United States. The cause? Stolen back-end credentials that lay unprotected by MFA.
Data warehousing giant Snowflake, meanwhile, also hit the headlines after hundreds of its customers’ (including Ticketmaster) private data leaked online. These breaches were again caused by the lack of mandatory MFA enforcement, with Snowflake subsequently introducing mandatory MFA as an option for Snowflake admins, though it’s still up to the customer whether to switch this on.
Ironically, as it relates to today’s news at least, security researchers at Google-owned cybersecurity company Mandiant worked with Snowflake to investigate the data theft, concluding that the data breaches highlighted the need for “…universal enforcement of MFA and secure authentication.”
And so Google is now following its own subsidiary’s advice.
Starting in early 2025, Google says that it will require all Google Cloud users who currently sign in with a password to activate MFA — this means they will only be able to access their Google Cloud accounts by using a secondary authentication mechanism, such as authenticator app or physical security key.
By the end of 2025, this requirement will be extended to so-called “federated users,” which refers to those who access Google Cloud resources through a third-party authenticator.
Google’s announcement follows hot on the heels of similar enforcements at rival cloud giants. AWS began a phased rollout of mandatory MFA back in June, while Microsoft followed suit with Azure shortly after.
It’s worth noting that while consumers can also benefit from MFA for standard Google Accounts, this remains optional, with users able to activate and deactivate the feature on a whim. The company says that while 70% of Google Accounts (those that are in regular use, at least) have what it calls two-step verification (2SV) turned on, it’s only making this mandatory for business customers due to the increased risks that come with enterprise cloud deployments. However, individual users who try to access Google Cloud Platform resources with their regular account will also be required to activate MFA.
“Today, there is broad 2SV adoption by users across all Google services,” notes Upadhyay. “However, given the sensitive nature of cloud deployments — and with phishing and stolen credentials remaining a top attack vector observed by our Mandiant Threat Intelligence team — we believe it’s time to require 2SV for all users of Google Cloud.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/how-a-box-on-a-roof-helped-transaera-to-land-8-2-million-in-funding/,How a box on a roof helped Transaera land $8.2 million in funding | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-05,"Transaera co-founder and CEO Sorin Grama may not have expected his startup to end up on the roof of a warehouse, but he’s happy to have landed there.
Over the summer, the company installed a massive ventilation system, known as a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), which dehumidifies fresh air coming into the warehouse, allowing the building’s air conditioning to operate more efficiently. That one box helped unlock $8.2 million in seed funding, Grama told TechCrunch.
“This new funding really came on the success of that commercial design and installation,” he said.
The company has been toiling for seven years, developing a novel air conditioning technology and searching for a market that would give them a jump start. The core dehumidification tech really could have been deployed anywhere. But its first home, atop a sprawling commercial building, helps Transaera get a foothold before tackling other markets.
The commercial HVAC market, “really wants — demands — more efficient systems,” Grama said. “From a customer perspective, there are lots of incentives for higher-efficiency AC,” including occupant comfort and lower electricity bills.
Previously, the company had envisioned its first product to be an in-home air conditioning unit, and Grama said it’s still committed to delivering one. Prototypes reveal a slick, wood-accented unit that resembles a mid-century modernist take on an old radio cabinet.
But the consumer market is “very cost driven, marketing driven,” he said. For now, the residential work has been put on the back burner, he added, though research and development for the project will continue with the help of $2.3 million in grants that Transaera was awarded by the Department of Energy.
Focusing on DOAS installations lets the company prove its technology in the field without having to invest in expensive marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. The new seed funding, led by Clean Energy Ventures with participation from Energy Impact Partners and MassMutual Ventures, will allow Transaera to make more DOAS pilot units and install them on commercial buildings.
“Initially, we have to build complete systems because we have to show how this works,” Grama said.
Ultimately, Transaera won’t be making the whole widget, but manufacturing components to ship to major HVAC companies, which can then assemble the entire system to be marketed and sold under their names.
“Once the technology is proven, once we have a few systems out there, the goal is to get the interest of the Carriers, the Trains, the Mitsubishis of the world to look at this and start incorporating this kind of dehumidification technology into their own products,” Grama said.
“Humans need better, more comfortable conditions, given the warming world,” he said of the decision to focus on residential and commercial buildings over data centers. “I think that’s where this product will have the biggest impact.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/canadian-authorities-say-they-arrested-hacker-linked-to-snowflake-data-breaches/,Canadian authorities say they arrested hacker linked to Snowflake data breaches | TechCrunch,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-11-05,"A hacker suspected of involvement in a series of massive Snowflake-related hacks has been arrested in Canada, according to local authorities.
Ian McLeod, a spokesperson for the Canadian Department of Justice, told TechCrunch in an email that, “following a request by the United States, Alexander Moucka (a.k.a. Connor Moucka) was arrested on a provisional arrest warrant on Wednesday October 30, 2024.”
For months, hackers stole internal data from dozens of companies, including AT&T, Ticketmaster, Advanced Auto Parts, and around 165 other corporate customers who use Snowflake, a company that provides cloud services and data analysis to other companies. The hackers stole huge amounts of often personally identifiable and sensitive corporate data that companies stored in Snowflake, in part by using passwords stolen from employee computers with malware. Because Snowflake did not require its customers to use multi-factor authentication on their accounts, the hackers were able to break in and steal large volumes of data using just the employee passwords.
The hacker, who used the monikers Waifu and Judische, told 404 Media last month that they were expecting to be arrested soon. 404 Media reported Moucka’s arrest on Monday.
“I’ve destroyed a lot of evidence and well poisoned the stuff I can’t destroy so when/if it does happen it’s just conspiracy which I can bond out and beat,” Judische, the hacker who claimed the Snowflake hacks, told the independent news website last month.
McLeod said that Moucka appeared in court on October 30 and “his case was adjourned to Tuesday November 5, 2024.” McLeod declined to comment on a potential extradition to the United States.
Google spokesperson Mark Karayan said Moucka was the hacker responsible for the Snowflake breaches.
“With his co-conspirator, John Binns, having been arrested by Turkish authorities earlier this year as well, this means that both threat actors responsible for this campaign are now finally in custody,” Karayan said, referring to the arrest of the 21-year-old American hacker who told The Wall Street Journal that he was behind the AT&T hack.
Austin Larsen, a senior threat analyst at Google’s cybersecurity firm Mandiant, who has been investigating the Snowflake hacks, said that “Alexander ‘Connor’ Moucka has proven to be one of the most consequential threat actors of 2024.”
“This arrest serves as a deterrent to cybercriminals and reinforces that their actions have serious consequences,” said Larsen.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.

Seoul’s Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) found Facebook’s parent collected information from about 980,000 users, on sensitive topics such as politics, sexuality, and religion, without obtaining their permission. It then shared it with some 4,000 advertisers in violation of local data protection rules.
Meta obtained the sensitive behavioral data by analyzing pages users had liked and ads they’d clicked on, among other tracking and profiling methods. PIPC said examples of sensitive info the company compiled included users being categorized as North Korean defectors, following a certain religion, or identifying as transgender or gay.
It also unfairly declined a user data access request and failed to prevent data on a small number of users being exposed to hackers.
Meta spokesman Matthew Pollard said: “We will be reviewing the full written decision once it’s shared with us. We remain committed to engaging with the PIPC to protect the privacy of South Korean users.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/printful-and-printify-ink-a-merger-deal/,Printful and Printify ink a merger deal | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-11-05,"Two veteran European companies in the world of on-demand printing are merging, and you may have not even realized they were separate companies to begin with. Printful and Printify, both startups with Latvian roots providing custom printing services, are coming together as a single company.
They are framing the move as a natural fit to unlock greater economies of scale, efficiencies, and profitability. But reading between the lines, it also underscores the struggles that startups in the on-demand manufacturing space, and the creator economy, are facing as single companies. Funding for later-stage startups has been especially challenging in Europe over the last several years, and it looks like 2025 will be no exception. While category growth looks to have slowed versus earlier years, the two companies said they currently reach “hundreds of thousands” of customers.
Mergers typically aim to drive efficiencies through headcount reduction. Asked about layoffs, a spokesman for the pair said: “There will be some areas of overlap between the two companies and some changes to teams will take place. The company leadership will ensure that this process is clear, transparent, and efficient.”
While the two existing brands will be maintained for the “foreseeable future,” per a press release, a new company name is planned — but is being kept under wraps for now. There will also be a new management team put in place, though both CEOs are slated to stay on. Also on the cards: new products — or “increasingly tailored and innovative solutions,” as their PR puts it.
Financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed.
The merged company said it plans to expand into more markets, serving everything from solo-entrepreneurs up to Fortune 500 companies wanting to be able to offer their own brand merch.
In terms of metrics, the companies are not providing like-for-like numbers. Printful says its business fulfills “more than a million” items a month, while Printify reports generating over 60 million orders since being founded almost a decade ago. Three years ago, Printify reported shipping a million units a month, although it’s not clear what its growth has looked like since then, so make of that what you will.
Printful was founded back in 2013 and has taken in $130 million in private equity funding, according to CrunchBase. Printify has raised a total of just over $54 million since being founded back in 2015. Investors include Index Ventures.
Commenting on the merger in a statement, Alex Saltonstall, Printful’s CEO, dubbed the development an “exciting moment for everyone.” Saltonstall has been in the job just over two years, following management changes after the original co-founder stepped back and took on an advisor role in summer 2022.
“Printify is a business that we have long respected and I believe that there is a natural fit between the two companies,” he said. “I’m excited to see our two great technology companies combine strengths and provide our customers with ever-improving opportunities to fulfill their business goals.”
Printify’s CEO Anastasija Oleinika is even more relatively recently in post: She went from CFO to the top job in April 2023, when the founder moved to an exec chairman role. “Our combined company will give our merchants more,” she said in her statement. “More top-quality products, more places to sell, more innovative solutions, and more growth and profit.”
Consolidation can also be a strategy to drive up prices by reducing consumer choice — a tactic that private equity has been known to deploy — so it will be interesting to see whether claims of greater product choice translate into fewer and higher prices for the pair’s users in the future, or see them “innovating” to expand value for their customers, too.
The merger has already passed regulatory review, according to the companies, as well as receiving “overwhelming support” from both their shareholders. So it’s full steam ahead for Printfulify — or whatever the combined entity will be called."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/deeproute-raises-100m-in-push-to-beat-teslas-fsd-in-china/,DeepRoute raises $100M in push to beat Tesla’s FSD in China | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-11-05,"DeepRoute.ai, a Shenzhen-based autonomous driving technology startup, raised $100 million from Great Wall Motor. The startup aims to get its automated driving systems into as many vehicles in China before Tesla takes off next year, according to a Reuters report.
DeepRoute did not publicly disclose the name of its automaker backer, but reports in the Chinese media, including a press release, point to Great Wall Motor. The automaker is one of China’s biggest, with new vehicle sales hitting 970,612 in the first 10 months of this year. GWM’s presence in Europe is also increasingly growing, as it works with BMW to produce the next Mini EV hatchback.
Alibaba-backed DeepRoute originally pursued Level 4 robotaxi R&D and development, but in 2022, the company shifted its strategy to focus on producing Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomous technology instead. (The SAE defines Level 4 systems as ones that can drive themselves in certain conditions without needing a human to take over. Level 2+ and Level 3 are driver assistance systems that require a human to remain attentive and take over when the system requests it.)
A spokesperson for DeepRoute told TechCrunch the startup will use the money to develop end-to-end visual-language-action models, which can directly interpret visual and language inputs to make driving decisions without separate steps needed for perception, planning, and control. DeepRoute also plans to use the funds to explore the possibilities for a future robotaxi business globally and to collaborate with more automakers.
That last goal seems to be top of mind for the startup, particularly as the Tesla’s driver assistance system, called Full Self-Driving (FSD), is gearing up to launch in China and Europe in the first quarter of 2025. China lifted certain restrictions on Tesla vehicles in April, clearing a path for the automaker to roll out FSD, which isn’t actually fully self-driving but does perform some automated driving tasks in cities and on highways.
DeepRoute is now racing to get its own ADAS into around 200,000 cars in China by the end of 2025, CEO Maxwell Zhou told Reuters. That’s a 10x increase from the 20,000 vehicles its tech is deployed in today.
The first vehicle model with DeepRoute’s system, which has yet to be publicly disclosed, launched in August. Zhou said the tech will come to two more models, including one co-owned by Geely and Mercedes-Benz, this year.
DeepRoute charges automakers a technology licensing fee per car and collects data that it uses to train its AI to handle more complicated traffic situations.
This article was originally published November 4 at 9:11 am PT. It has been updated to include more information about DeepRoute’s backer and goals."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/ai-startups-will-need-quality-of-revenue-to-raise-in-2025-seed-vcs-warn/,"AI startups will need 'quality of revenue' to raise in 2025, seed VCs warn | TechCrunch",Julie Bort,2024-11-05,"Fundraising in 2025 will continue to be a “tale of two cities,” VC Renata Quintini, co-founder of early-stage VC Renegade Partners, said onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt last week.
“Some companies, really having the promise of going after big markets growing fast, [will be] receiving a lot of funding and momentum.” But on the other side, the “companies that need to build real businesses and efficient businesses” will struggle to raise cash, Quintini warned.
She’s referring to the tight fundraising market that startups have faced in the era of higher interest rates. In 2023, some 3,200 startups died after they easily raised money during the party times of 2021. In 2024, VCs stampeded toward funding AI companies, and many other early-stage startups struggled to raise and more deaths occurred. Fintech was particularly brutal in 2024.
As 2025 arrives, the best chance of getting venture funding will be to have solid business fundamentals. (Unless you’re, say, a world-renowned AI scientist.) That means selling a product or service at a profitable price point that serves a sizable customer base.
But wait! There will be more to it than just landing paying customers, VC Corinne Riley, partner at Greylock warned onstage.
“There is no set milestone” of sales or growth that will turn VCs’ heads next year, Riley says. “There is no key number that if you achieve it you’re going to raise a successful Series A. What we’re looking for is actually the quality of the ARR [annual recurring revenue], and not the quantity of ARR.”
In other words, are customers sticking around once they’re on board? Do they tend to increase their spending with the startup over time? The startup might actually have fewer customers than competitors, and less revenue, but if the customers it signs stay, investors will write checks.
“We’re looking for a quality customer base that you’re going to be able to repeat over and over and over again once you have more capital,” Riley says.
“This is what VCs mean when they talk about ‘you need to build moat,’” VC Elizabeth Yin, co-founder of Hustle Fund, said onstage. That’s a way to describe how to lock in customers so they won’t choose to leave. “The more unique things that you can do that other people can’t do, the more that helps you.”
Riley offered as an example a Greylock portfolio company called Braintrust, which helps developers build and evaluate the performance of their AI apps. Greylock was convinced to lead its $5 million seed deal because the founder, Ankur Goyal, landed early customers who were “taste makers in the industry.” He had Zapier, Coda, Airtable, and Instacart as customers, “people that were at the forefront of building products with AI,” she described.
Well-connected marquee customers, should they be happy with the offering, bring in other such customers, and so the cycle goes. Braintrust has gone on to land other known tech names like Stripe and Notion, it says. And in October, Andreessen Horowitz’s Martin Casado led a $36 million Series A, with Greylock participating.
Such “quality of customers” has always mattered to investors — that’s why naming customers is important. But in 2025, after the AI gold rush, that metric will become even more critical because much of the revenue that so many AI startups have reeled in will turn out to be one-time-only revenue.
In another panel at Disrupt, one on bouncing back after a down round, VC Elliott Robinson, a partner with Bessemer Venture Partners, described the situation. At the start of 2024, the boards of nearly every large company bit their nails over AI and allocated fat exploratory budgets to their CIOs to go buy products and explore.
“Now we’ve kind of lived through 18 and 24 months of buying AI stuff, and where we’ve seen companies go from zero to four [million dollars in revenue] and four to 20 [million],” he said. “The question now is, what’s going to be renewed? Because the CIO budget is starting to dry up.”
CIOs will only continue to buy stuff that has measurably made a difference. So all that revenue, and all those customers for so many AI startups — and potentially those in AI-adjacent areas, like application monitoring — does not mean that a particular startup is a good bet for the future.
Or, as Quintini describes, “At the end of the day, what you’re trying to do is, one, build something that compounds. Then number two, you’re either going to be in a business that you run faster than the other people, or you do something that other people cannot replicate.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/people-are-using-games-like-pictionary-to-benchmark-ai-now/,Can Pictionary and Minecraft test AI models' ingenuity? | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-05,"Most AI benchmarks don’t tell us much. They ask questions that can be solved with rote memorization, or cover topics that aren’t relevant to the majority of users.
So some AI enthusiasts are turning to games as a way to test AIs’ problem-solving skills.
Paul Calcraft, a freelance AI developer, has built an app where two AI models can play a Pictionary-like game with each other. One model doodles, while the other model tries to guess what the doodle represents.
“I thought this sounded super fun and potentially interesting from a model capabilities point of view,” Calcraft told TechCrunch in an interview. “So I sat indoors on a cloudy Saturday and got it done.”
Calcraft was inspired by a similar project by British programmer Simon Willison that tasked models with rendering a vector drawing of a pelican riding a bicycle. Willison, like Calcraft, chose a challenge he believed would force models to “think” beyond the contents of their training data.
“The idea is to have a benchmark that’s un-gameable,” Calcraft said. “A benchmark that can’t be beaten by memorizing specific answers or simple patterns that have been seen before during training.”
Minecraft is in this “un-gameable” category as well, or so believes 16-year-old Adonis Singh. He’s created a tool, mc-bench, that gives a model control over a Minecraft character and tests its ability to design structures, along the lines of Microsoft’s Project Malmo.
“I believe Minecraft tests the models on resourcefulness and gives them more agency,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s not nearly as restricted and saturated as [other] benchmarks.”
Using games to benchmark AI is nothing new. The idea dates back decades: Mathematician Claude Shannon argued in 1949 that games like chess were a worthy challenge for “intelligent” software. More recently, Alphabet’s DeepMind developed a model that could play Pong and Breakout; OpenAI trained AI to compete in Dota 2 matches; and Meta designed an algorithm that could hold its own against professional Texas hold ’em players.
But what’s different now is that enthusiasts are hooking up large language models (LLMs) — models with the ability to analyze text, images, and more — to games to probe how good they are at logic.
There’s an abundance of LLMs out there, from Gemini and Claude to GPT-4o, and they all have different “vibes,” so to speak. They “feel” different in one interaction to the next — a phenomenon that can be difficult to quantify.
“LLMs are known to be sensitive to particular ways questions are asked, and just generally unreliable and hard to predict,” Calcraft said.
In contrast to text-based benchmarks, games provide a visual, intuitive way to compare how a model performs and behaves, said Matthew Guzdial, an AI researcher and professor at the University of Alberta.
“We can think of every benchmark as giving us a different simplification of reality focused on particular types of problems, like reasoning or communication,” he said. “Games are just other ways you can do decision-making with AI, so folks are using them like any other approach.”
Those familiar with the history of generative AI will note how similar Pictionary is to generative adversarial networks (GANs), in which a creator model sends images to a discriminator model that then evaluates them.
Calcraft believes that Pictionary can capture an LLM’s ability to understand concepts like shapes, colors and prepositions (e.g., the meaning of “in” versus “on”). He wouldn’t go so far as to say that the game is a reliable test of reasoning, but he argued that winning requires strategy and the ability to understand clues — neither of which models find easy.
“I also really like the almost adversarial nature of the Pictionary game, similar to GANs, where you have the two different roles: one draws and the other guesses,” he said. “The best one to draw is not the most artistic, but the one that can most clearly convey the idea to the audience of other LLMs (including to the faster, much less capable models!).”
“Pictionary is a toy problem that’s not immediately practical or realistic,” Calcraft cautioned. “That said, I do think spatial understanding and multimodality are critical elements for AI advancement, so LLM Pictionary could be a small, early step on that journey.”
Singh believes that Minecraft is a useful benchmark, too, and can measure reasoning in LLMs. “From the models I’ve tested so far, the results literally perfectly align with how much I trust the model for something reasoning-related,” he said.
Others aren’t so sure.
Mike Cook, a research fellow at Queen Mary University specializing in AI, doesn’t think Minecraft is particularly special as an AI testbed.
“I think some of the fascination with Minecraft comes from people outside of the games sphere who maybe think that, because it looks like ‘the real world,’ it has a closer connection to real-world reasoning or action,” Cook told TechCrunch. “From a problem-solving perspective, it’s not so dissimilar to a video game like Fortnite, Stardew Valley, or World of Warcraft. It’s just got a different dressing on top that makes it look more like an everyday set of tasks like building things or exploring.”
To Cook’s point, even the best game-playing AI systems generally don’t adapt well to new environments, and can’t easily solve problems they haven’t seen before. For example, it’s unlikely a model that excels at Minecraft will play Doom with any real skill.
“I think the good qualities Minecraft does have from an AI perspective are extremely weak reward signals and a procedural world, which means unpredictable challenges,” Cook continued. “But it’s not really that much more representative of the real world than any other video game.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/flash-founded-by-ex-flipcart-exec-launches-in-the-us-to-help-shoppers-juggle-online-orders/,"Flash, founded by ex-Flipkart exec, launches in the US to help shoppers juggle multiple online orders  | TechCrunch",Lauren Forristal,2024-11-05,"Flash, the payment management service that tracks all your online purchases, announced Tuesday its entry into the U.S. market, giving American customers the ability to manage all of their spending in one place while also earning rewards, such as gift cards and cash back.
The U.S. is home to many big spenders, making it a strategic choice to launch the app here. The Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce estimates that online shopping in the U.S. brought in about $291.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. It estimated that total retail sales amounted to roughly $1.8 trillion. Projections for the global e-commerce market are also promising, with estimates suggesting it will surpass $6 trillion this year.
The app was previously only available to users in India.
Flash, available now to download on both iOS and Android devices, lets you centralize all of your online purchases into one place, while also letting you track multiple shipments, receipts, and your entire order history for the year. By connecting your email to the app, it compiles all the messages sent from brands to create an overview of where you shop, how much you spend, and which brands you frequent the most. It also categorizes your spending into separate areas such as shopping, travel, food and groceries, and entertainment. The insights feature could help you budget more effectively and gain a clearer understanding of your spending habits. For instance, maybe refrain from all those sweet treats at Starbucks (it adds up!).
Additionally, when you place new orders through various brands, such as Amazon, Booking.com, DoorDash, Instacart, Target, and Walmart, you’ll earn points that can be redeemed for $5-$100 gift cards. With the free version of the app, you earn 10 points for every order and 100 points for flights and hotels. If you opt for the paid plan, you can earn five times the number of points.
The app is free to download; however, if you upgrade to the Flash Plus plan for $49/year, you’ll receive an email ID (@flash.co) to get a dedicated smart inbox that you can use for all shopping-related emails. The subscription also includes AI-powered spam protection, advanced tracking features, and other benefits.
Founded by Flipkart’s former senior vice president, Ranjith Boyanapalli, the India-based startup got its start in 2022, when Boyanapalli realized how flooded his email inbox had become with promotional messages from brands.
“If you look at the genesis, it started by being a power shopper and realizing 60% of all my personal communication, the primary email that I use, is actually commerce related,” Boyanapalli told TechCrunch. “I find myself spending across 20 to 30 brands in a year minimum, across all these domains. For example, last year, I received about 12,500 [shopping-related] emails, of which probably 10,400 emails were promotional in nature… So that created the genesis that, ‘Hey, it’s probably time to have a separate shopping identity.’ And that’s how Flash got created.”
Since its launch, the platform has achieved success among users in India, with one million app downloads.
The company has always planned to expand into additional markets, with the U.S. being a clear choice. Boyanapalli noted that Flash’s U.S. app has been tested by around 200 beta users. Over the past year, these users collectively placed nearly 35,000 orders, totaling around $2 million across hundreds of different brands.
“We thought now is the right time for us to launch and scale up, especially given the holiday season kicking in,” Boyanapalli added.
The only difference between the two versions is the subscription offering, which is exclusively available in the U.S. Meanwhile, Flash opted for an advertising model in India. However, Boyanapalli noted that this could change.
Next on the roadmap is a global version of the app, which is set to launch in mid-June 2025. The company also plans to raise new capital to support its expansion in the U.S., which is set to take place in the first quarter of 2025.
The story was updated to clarify that Flash doesn’t have any direct partnerships with brands as of yet."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/ai-safety-advocates-tell-founders-to-slow-down/,AI safety advocates tell founders to slow down | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-11-05,"“Move cautiously and red-team things” is sadly not as catchy as “move fast and break things.” But three AI safety advocates made it clear to startup founders that going too fast can lead to ethical issues in the long run.
“We are at an inflection point where there are tons of resources being moved into this space,” said Sarah Myers West, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute, onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. “I’m really worried that right now there’s just such a rush to sort of push product out onto the world, without thinking about that legacy question of what is the world that we really want to live in, and in what ways is the technology that’s being produced acting in service of that world or actively harming it.”
The conversation comes at a moment when the issue of AI safety feels more pressing than ever. In October, the family of a child who died by suicide sued chatbot company Character.AI for its alleged role in the child’s death.
“This story really demonstrates the profound stakes of the very rapid rollout that we’ve seen of AI-based technologies,” Myers West said. “Some of these are longstanding, almost intractable problems of content moderation of online abuse.
But beyond these life-or-death issues, the stakes of AI remain high, from misinformation to copyright infringement.
“We are building something that has a lot of power and the ability to really, really impact people’s lives,” said Jingna Zhang, founder of artist-forward social platform Cara. “When you talk about something like Character.AI, that emotionally really engages with somebody, it makes sense that I think there should be guardrails around how the product is built.”
Zhang’s platform Cara took off after Meta made it clear that it could use any user’s public posts to train its AI. For artists like Zhang herself, this policy is a slap in the face. Artists need to post their work online to build a following and secure potential clients, but by doing that, their work could be used to shape the very AI models that could one day put them out of work.
“Copyright is what protects us and allows us to make a living,” Zhang said. If artwork is available online, that doesn’t mean it’s free, per se — digital news publications, for example, have to license images from photographers in order to use them. “When generative AI started becoming much more mainstream, what we are seeing is that it does not work with what we are typically used to, that’s been established in law. And if they wanted to use our work, they should be licensing it.”
Artists could also be impacted by products like ElevenLabs, an AI voice cloning company that’s worth over a billion dollars. As head of safety at ElevenLabs, it’s up to Aleksandra Pedraszewska to make sure that the company’s sophisticated technology isn’t co-opted for nonconsensual deepfakes, among other things.
“I think red-teaming models, understanding undesirable behaviors, and unintended consequences of any new launch that a generative AI company does is again becoming [a top priority],” she said. “ElevenLabs has 33 million users today. This is a massive community that gets impacted by any change that we make in our product.”
Pedraszewska said that one way people in her role can be more proactive about keeping platforms safe is to have a closer relationship with the community of users.
“We cannot just operate between two extremes, one being entirely anti-AI and anti-GenAI, and then another one, effectively trying to persuade zero regulation of the space. I think that we do need to meet in the middle when it comes to regulation,” she said.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/amazon-begins-delivering-certain-products-via-drone-in-phoenix/,Amazon begins delivering select products via drone in Phoenix | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-05,"A few months after ending its drone-based delivery program, Prime Air, in California, Amazon says that it’s begun making deliveries to select customers via drone in Phoenix, Arizona.
Starting today, Amazon customers in the West Valley Phoenix Metro Area have access to a drone-deliverable selection from Amazon’s catalog, including household, beauty, office, health, and tech supplies. Products must weigh five pounds or less to be eligible; Amazon says about 50,000 are available at launch.
Customers can choose the drone delivery location for their address before they check out. Most can expect to receive items in an hour max, according to Amazon, delivered direct from the take-off site in Tolleson.
An Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch that drone delivery will be available during the daylight hours and “favorable” weather conditions. “Currently we do not offer drone delivery at night, during heavy winds, or during heavy rain,” they added. “Customers in designated delivery area within a radius of our site can get a drone delivery … We’ll inform customers when drone delivery is live in their area.”
Amazon’s using its latest drone for deliveries, the MK30, which was recently approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly beyond the visual line of sight of drone operators. Amazon claims the MK30 can fly twice as far as its previous drone, is about 50% quieter to the human ear, and is built to fly in rainy weather.
Amazon has also started to deploy the MK30 to make deliveries in College Station, Texas, where the company has been testing drone-based prescription medicine deliveries since 2023.
Amazon’s drone delivery efforts have faced a number of setbacks, from complaints over noise to regulatory hurdles and layoffs. Widespread cost-cutting efforts by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have also stymied the service’s progress.
To set the stage for easier — and presumably less expensive — deployments, Amazon says it’s now integrating its drone systems into its same-day delivery network instead of building standalone facilities.
Amazon previously said that it would bring its drone delivery offerings to the U.K. and Italy by the end of 2024. The company gave no update on those plans today."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/india-issues-notice-to-wikipedia-over-concerns-of-bias/,Wikipedia says hasn't received notice over alleged bias concerns from India | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-11-05,"Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit organization that operates Wikipedia, said on Thursday that the firm hasn’t received an official notice from the Indian government over alleged concentrated editorial control and persistent complaints about bias and inaccuracies on the platform.
A number of outlets, including TechCrunch, reported on Tuesday that the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting had questioned the encyclopedia’s intermediary status that’s offered to tech platforms in India.
A Wikimedia spokesperson denied receiving an official notice from the Indian government in the last two days and said the foundation “stands behind its community of volunteers and core values, enabling millions worldwide to access well-sourced information at no cost.”
The Indian ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The supposed query from Ministry of Information and Broadcasting follows a contentious case in the Delhi High Court, where judges have described Wikipedia’s open editing feature as “dangerous” and threatened to suspend its operations in India. The court is hearing a defamation case brought by news agency Asian News International, which seeks to identify Wikipedia contributors who allegedly characterized the news agency as a “propaganda tool” for India’s government.
Justice Navin Chawla had dismissed Wikipedia’s plea for additional time to respond due to its lack of physical presence in India, warning of initiating contempt proceedings against the platform if it failed to comply with orders to disclose user information. “If you don’t want to comply with Indian regulations, then don’t operate in India,” the judge stated.
Wikipedia has maintained that its volunteer editors must adhere to its established policies regarding verifiable content and legal guidelines, though this defense has faced increasing scrutiny from Indian authorities concerned about the platform’s content moderation practices.
Nikhil Pahwa, editor of MediaNama and a prominent voice on technology policy, questioned the legal basis of the government’s move, arguing that India’s IT law determines platform status based on function rather than the number of editors.
“You can be a platform with one user/editor or a billion,” he wrote on X.
“Wikipedia volunteers carefully curate information from reliable news sources and other reputable external publications; they don’t add original content to the site,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. “This approach ensures that Wikipedia compiles information from credible sources. All sources are cited on article pages, upholding our commitment to transparency. Wikipedia articles are required by its editorial policies to maintain a neutral point of view. Volunteers from many backgrounds and political persuasions edit Wikipedia. This model reinforces that Wikipedia articles present a broad view of knowledge on a topic, rather than any one perspective.”
The story has been updated with Wikimedia’s comment."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/alan-unveils-ai-based-health-assistant-to-complement-its-health-insurance/,Alan unveils AI health assistant for its 680K health insurance members | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-11-05,"While Alan is better known as a health insurance company, the French startup has always tried to offer more than insurance coverage. It now wants to build a super app for all things related to healthcare and announced three new product updates on Tuesday morning, including an AI chatbot that’s vetted by doctors.
Alan has long offered its customers a chat interface that lets them ask a question to a doctor and get an answer within 15 minutes or so. The next logical step these days would be to leverage artificial intelligence for medical conversations, so Alan is adding a virtual assistant called Mo to the chat feature.
“On the one hand, we increasingly want to be in charge of our own health. On the other, our healthcare system is mostly reactive and is therefore under constant strain,” Alan’s AI lead Antoine Lizée said at a press conference on Tuesday.
But given that AI chatbots tend to hallucinate, healthcare professionals may not want to rely on inaccurate information or risk misdiagnosing a patient. This issue has come up in the news lately with AI-based medical transcriptions — eight out of ten audio transcriptions exhibited some level of hallucinated information, according to a study by a University of Michigan researcher.
Alan said it has put in place guardrails to prevent this. First, using the AI chatbot is entirely optional. “Mo rephrases my question, introduces itself and asks if I want to start with Mo or if I want to talk to a doctor,” Lizée explained.
Second, Mo’s answers are checked by a doctor within 15 minutes. They can either confirm the medical advice or correct what has been said in the conversation. Patients will then receive a message explaining how the doctor feels about the AI’s answers.
Alan said it has facilitated 900 conversations between its users and Mo over the past few weeks. But given that 680,000 people are currently covered by Alan’s health insurance products, Mo is quickly going to become a widely used healthcare-related AI chatbot. It will be interesting to see how people react to this new feature and how Alan tweaks the bot over time.
Mo is mostly a chatbot for now, but the company plans to give it the ability to remember more details and add personalization features to make it more proactive. “This is just the beginning. Our vision for Mo goes beyond that. Our vision is to make it a health companion that understands your context and your health history,” Lizée said.
In addition to the AI features, Alan unveiled a mobile shop from which users can buy dietary supplements, sports accessories, baby-related goods, and other health-adjacent products.
“It’s a curated selection of health and wellness products to improve your daily life,” Alan product manager Mélanie Alsberghe said. “We favor French brands that share our high standards and values. And we have negotiated preferential rates for our members.”
This feels like the first step of a bigger play. Online pharmacies aren’t very common in France due to regulatory and logistics hurdles, so Alan could be well-positioned to offer over-the-counter drugs and more in the near future.
Finally, the company is launching Alan Walk, a gamified step counter. If you opt in to Alan Walk, the app will use your phone or smartwatch’s built-in pedometer to record how many steps you’ve walked.
Alan said Walk has been designed to fight sedentary lifestyles, and when you reach certain step goals, you’ll unlock berries (a virtual currency).
“You can exchange your berries to donate to charities, or get discounts on the Alan Shop, or personalize your avatar,” Alan product manager Antoine Moulet said. There’s even a leaderboard that shows your rank alongside all your colleagues.
“For us, this is all about improving this integrated experience between health insurance, prevention, and access to medical care,” Alan co-founder and CEO Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve said.
Alan recently raised a $193 million funding round at an impressive $4.5 billion valuation. After France, Belgium, and Spain, the company last month announced plans to expand to Canada, where it will be the first new health insurance company in almost 70 years."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/coatue-is-raising-1b-for-ai-bets/,Coatue is raising $1B for AI bets | TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,2024-11-05,"Coatue Management, a hedge fund that invested heavily in tech startups during the pandemic-infused boom, is raising $1 billion to back AI-focused companies, Bloomberg reported on Monday.
The funding, which will top up the firm’s flagship fund, will be raised primarily from institutional investors. However, high-net-worth individuals with accounts at the brokerage Raymond James & Associates could also invest in Coatue, per the report.
Coatue, which has nearly $50 billion in assets under management, has invested in over 170 VC-backed companies in 2021, according to PitchBook data. Coatue has since drastically slowed its startup investing pace, backing only 81 companies in 2022 and about 30 companies in 2023.
The crossover investor isn’t done with investing in private companies, however. So far in 2024, Coatue has backed 29 startups, PitchBook data shows. The firm’s latest AI-focused investments include Glean, Scale AI, and Skild AI, which is building a general-purpose AI robot. Philippe Laffont, Coatue’s founder (pictured above) has said he is particularly excited about humanoid robots with AI-powered brains."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/metas-former-hardware-lead-for-orion-is-joining-openai/,Meta's former hardware lead for Orion is joining OpenAI | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-11-05,"The former head of Meta’s augmented reality glasses efforts announced on Monday she is joining OpenAI to lead robotics and consumer hardware, according to a post on LinkedIn. OpenAI confirmed to TechCrunch that Caitlin Kalinowski will be joining the startup.
Kalinowski is a hardware executive who began leading Meta’s AR glasses team in March 2022. She oversaw the creation of Orion, the impressive augmented reality prototype that Meta recently showed off at its annual Connect conference. Kalinowski also led the hardware team behind Meta’s virtual reality goggles for roughly nine years. Before that, she worked at Apple, designing the hardware for MacBooks.
“I’m delighted to share that I’m joining OpenAI to lead robotics and consumer hardware,” said Kalinowski in her post. “In my new role, I will initially focus on OpenAI’s robotics work and partnerships to help bring AI into the physical world and unlock its benefits for humanity.”
Possibly, Kalinowski will work with her old boss Jony Ive, a former Apple executive, on a new AI hardware device that OpenAI and Ive’s startup, LoveFrom, are building together. In September, Ive confirmed he was building a hardware product with OpenAI, describing it as “a product that uses AI to create a computing experience that is less socially disruptive than the iPhone.”
OpenAI also recently started hiring research engineers for a robotics team that’s aimed at helping OpenAI’s partners incorporate its multimodal AI into their hardware. The reboot of OpenAI’s robotics team comes roughly four years after the startup disbanded its hardware research to focus its efforts on software. In 2018, OpenAI built a robot hand that could learn how to grip objects all on its own.
Several companies already are incorporating OpenAI’s models into their hardware. The most obvious is Apple, which will launch its ChatGPT integration for the iPhone later this year. Another is the robotics company Figure, whose humanoid 01 robot leverages OpenAI’s software for natural speech conversations."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/datadog-challenger-dash0-aims-to-dash-observability-bill-shock/,Datadog challenger Dash0 aims to dash observability bill shock | TechCrunch,Anna Heim,2024-11-05,"The end of zero-interest rates has driven companies to look for savings wherever they can, but one area continues to be a major budget drain. Observability — collecting and understanding data and systems — typically remains an organization’s second-highest cloud expenditure, right after cloud provisioning itself. People have even gone so far as to talk of an observability cost crisis, underscored by anecdotes like Coinbase spending $65 million on its Datadog bill.
And why is observability so pricey and important? Complex cloud architectures and microservices are here to stay, and with security issues and service outages all too common, ops teams need observability data to keep systems running.
Now a startup called Dash0 is launching to address the cost issue — if not by being cheaper, then by at least making buying and paying for their services easier.
Dash0 — pronounced “Dash-zero” — is a Datadog competitor whose pitch doesn’t revolve around drastically lowering observability costs. Founder Mirko Novakovic (left in the picture above) still expects companies to spend 10% to 20% of cloud costs on this budget item. But he and his team want to improve transparency, both in terms of pricing and of observability itself.
Dash0 says it can do this by way of how it’s built, by fully leveraging the open source observability framework OpenTelemetry (aka OTel), Novakovic told TechCrunch, which includes a feature called Semantic conventions that allows someone, “at any given time, [to] see exactly which service or which developer or which application creates how much cost on the observability side,” he said.
There are other companies, such as Signoz, that describe themselves as OTel-native, but Dash0’s positioning has resonated with investors. It raised a $9.5 million seed funding round led by Accel, with participation from Dig Ventures, the investment firm of MulesSoft founder Ross Mason.
Novakovic’s track record may have also helped. His previous company, Instana, also backed by Accel, was acquired by IBM at the end of 2020 for $500 million, a price that has never been publicly disclosed before now. Several other Instana alums are also now part of the Dash0 team.
If Dash0 is built on OTel, it’s also trying to improve it. The framework has actually been around since 2019, but “it is not that easy to use at the moment,” Novakovic said. “Vendors have to do a lot of work in making sure that it gets at least as easy as installing a Datadog agent. That’s where we are still lagging behind the proprietary folks.”
As a company, Dash0 hopes to unlock OTel’s benefits — vendor-agnostic standardized data — but with an intuitive UI, dashboards, and integrations with Slack, email and other tools. Its initial target customers are companies that have between 50 and 5,000 employees.
The company is now launching publicly, but it won’t heavily invest in sales and marketing until it is sure it has hit product-market fit. In the meantime, Novakovic said, its resources will go toward growing the tech and product side of its team, which now consists of 21 people, of whom 19 are engineers, all working remotely.
Its next 10 hires will include a developer relations specialist who will also contribute to driving the adoption of OpenTelemetry as a solid alternative to proprietary options. On that front, the company intends to work with other OTel-related startups while making sure that “missing parts” like dashboards and query languages fall into place with projects like Perses and PromQL. “That’s a community effort together with the customers,” Novakovic said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/bowery-farming-is-ceasing-operations/,Bowery Farming is ceasing operations | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-11-04,"Agtech unicorn Bowery Farming is shutting down, according to PitchBook, which cited internal documents and multiple company employees.
The New York-based agtech company was known for building vertical farms that could produce crops, including lettuces, herbs, and berries. Per Pitchbook, Bowery Farming has raised more than $700 million in funding from First Round Capital, General Catalyst, and GV, among many other venture firms. Its most recent round in 2021 valued it at more than $2 billion.
PitchBook previously reported that Bowery Farming held multiple rounds of layoffs in 2023.
Vertical farming has proved to be a tough category, with both AeroFarms and AppHarvest filing for bankruptcy protection. AeroFarms raised more than $300 million from backers before filing for bankruptcy. In September 2023, it exited bankruptcy protection fully funded. AppHarvest raised more than $700 million before being taken public in 2021 at a $1 billion valuation; it filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2023.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/apple-users-can-soon-upgrade-to-chatgpt-plus-within-the-settings-app/,Apple users can soon upgrade to ChatGPT Plus within the Settings app | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-11-04,"Apple products are getting an integration with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in December when iOS 18.2 rolls out, which should supercharge Siri and a few other features with smarter AI. On Monday, iOS 18.2 beta testers got a taste of how OpenAI could profit off of its Apple partnership.
Apple is including an option to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus inside its Settings app, according to an update to the iOS 18.2 beta spotted by 9to5Mac. This will give Apple users a direct route to sign up for OpenAI’s premium subscription plan, which costs $20 a month. This could drive lots of users to sign up for ChatGPT Plus, a core revenue driver for OpenAI, especially because the free version of ChatGPT can be quite limited.
Free ChatGPT users won’t have access to OpenAI’s latest models (such as o1-preview) or premium features such as Advanced Voice Mode. They also can only make two images with Dall-E per day, and can’t send as many messages to the AI chatbot as premium users.
A big lingering question in Apple and OpenAI’s partnership is how both companies expect to make money off the deal. Apple reportedly isn’t paying Sam Altman’s startup for the integration in money, but rather, exposure. The ability to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus in Settings might be enough exposure that this whole thing is worth it for OpenAI, but only if users actually sign up. Otherwise, OpenAI will be on the hook for a large influx of new ChatGPT free users, which will undoubtedly drive up the startup’s AI inference costs.
It’s also unclear whether Apple is taking a cut of the revenue OpenAI generates from ChatGPT Plus signups through the Settings app. It’s possible the iPhone maker is simply betting that having cutting-edge AI features is worth the free exposure it’s giving OpenAI, because it will push enough customers to upgrade to new phones.
Nevertheless, this is a strange deal. Even though Apple is letting ChatGPT power many of its biggest AI updates yet, the iPhone maker isn’t making this an exclusive deal. Apple says it will soon integrate AI models from other developers, potentially including Google’s Gemini.
In the background of this integration, OpenAI is raising money and losing key executives at an unprecedented rate. Apple was reportedly supposed to participate in the latest $6.6 billion round, but pulled out shortly after OpenAI’s CTO Mira Murati abruptly left the company."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/perplexity-ceo-offers-ai-companys-services-to-replace-striking-nyt-staff/,Perplexity CEO offers AI company's services to replace striking NYT staff | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-11-04,"The CEO of AI search company Perplexity, Aravind Srinivas, has offered to cross picket lines and provide services to mitigate the effect of a strike by New York Times tech workers.
The NYT Tech Guild announced its strike Monday, after setting November 4 as its deadline months earlier. The workers represented provide software support and data analysis for the Times, on the business side of the outlet. They have been asking for an annual 2.5% wage increase and to cement a current two days per week in-office expectation, among other things.
“But the company has decided that our members aren’t worth enough to agree to a fair contract and stop committing unfair labor practices,” the guild wrote on X.
“They have left us no choice but to demonstrate the power of our labor on the picket line,” said Kathy Zhang, the organization’s unit chair, in a statement.
The NYT’s publisher, AG Sulzberger, criticized a strike two days ahead of the U.S. presidential election, saying in a statement, “Hundreds of millions of people are depending on The Times’s journalism on Election Day and afterward, and it is troubling that the Tech Guild would try to block this public service at such a consequential moment for our country.”
Picketers demonstrated in front of the NYT building in New York as negotiations continued. Meanwhile, on X, formerly known as Twitter, Perplexity’s CEO offered to step in for the striking workers.
Replying to Semafor media editor Max Tani quoting the publisher, Srinivas wrote: “Hey AG Sulzberger @nytimes sorry to see this. Perplexity is on standby to help ensure your essential coverage is available to all through the election. DM me anytime here.”
Many on X immediately castigated Srinivas for acting as a scab — a derogatory term for people willing to perform the jobs of striking workers. It is widely considered a disreputable behavior in matters of labor and equity. By undercutting collective action, scabs limit the ability of workers to bargain with those in positions of power.
Srinivas may simply be trying to make sure people have the information they need on election day. The company has lately unveiled its own elections info hub and map. But to offer its services explicitly as a replacement for striking workers was bound to be an unpopular move.
Though TechCrunch asked Perplexity for comment, Srinivas responded to TechCrunch’s post on X saying that “the offer was *not* to ‘replace’ journalists or engineers with AI but to provide technical infra support on a high-traffic day.” The striking workers in question, however, are the ones who provide that service to the NYT. It’s not really clear what services other than AI tools Perplexity could offer, or why they would not amount to replacing the workers in question. (However, in response to the clarification, we have opted to change the headline to reflect the claim that this offer was not necessarily specific to AI services.)
The NYT and Perplexity aren’t exactly on the best of terms right now. The Times sent Perplexity a cease and desist letter in October over the startup’s scraping of articles for use by its AI models. In a conversation last week with TechCrunch, the normally outspoken CEO declined to define “plagiarism.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/bluesky-gears-up-for-election-day-as-x-goes-pro-trump/,Bluesky gears up for Election Day as X goes pro-Trump | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-11-04,"As Election Day in the U.S. nears, social networking startup Bluesky, now flush with new capital, hopes to demonstrate that its platform can serve as a more trusted, fact-checked alternative to Elon Musk’s X. While the latter is dominated by Musk’s support for the Trump campaign, Bluesky tends to lean left, thanks to its influx of disgruntled former Twitter users who don’t like the platform’s new direction. Now, with the U.S. elections upon us, Bluesky is setting up for its biggest test yet: its ability to handle the potential misinformation that can mislead users during these critical national events, including any posts meant to disrupt the voting process or those using new technologies, like AI, to confuse the voting public.
While X’s other competitor, Meta’s Threads app, has distanced itself from politics — even going so far as to no longer recommend users political content — Bluesky has capitalized on the demand for a real-time social network that prioritizes such discussions. Timed with X’s recent changes to the block function, which have angered some users, Bluesky may be poised to once again benefit from another X exodus as users make the switch.
To manage its election operations, Bluesky earlier this year hired a notable former Twitter leader as its head of Trust and Safety, Aaron Rodericks. Already experienced with the policies, tools, and teams needed to manage election safety at Twitter, where he co-led its Trust and Safety team, Rodericks once made headlines as the target of a right-wing campaign on X after announcing on LinkedIn how he was looking to hire more staffers for the 2024 election season. The exec later lost his job at X when Musk cut half the election integrity team after promising to expand it.
Now at Bluesky, the Rodericks-led team announced how it’s preparing to handle the U.S. presidential election, including by reviewing content for potential misinformation as well as other unconfirmed reports and claims.
In a series of posts on Bluesky, the Bluesky Safety team detailed its plans for election safety, reminding users that they can report posts to Bluesky’s moderation service for misleading and illegal or urgent content by clicking on the three-dot menu next to each post and account. There will also be a priority queue in its system for any election-related reported posts.
To keep the process “safe and accurate,” Bluesky says it will also remove any content that “encourages or glorifies intimidation or disruption in voting, tabulation, or  certification.” It also plans to label posts with misleading claims about voting, like those sharing incorrect requirements around voter ID or other manipulated media.
Meanwhile, “emerging” reports related to the election that can’t immediately be verified will be labeled as “unconfirmed.” For instance, if someone reports there are long lines at their polling place or other incidents at the polls, these will likely be labeled unconfirmed at the time of the assessment. (The company didn’t share if and how it would update these reports if national media later confirmed them, however.)
The company says its plans to moderate the platform extend beyond election day, too, as it will work to identify and address any disruptions to the “peaceful transition of power” as well.
Plus, Bluesky says it is reserving the right to roll out more safeguards in the days to come, if needed, to ensure election safety on the platform.
Unlike X and Threads, where moderation is handled only by the business itself, Bluesky’s decentralized promise is that anyone can run their own Bluesky server and their own moderation service. Users can also subscribe to multiple moderation services to customize their feed to their liking.
“Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see,” the company explained in March. “On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.” In other words, if you don’t like how Bluesky is running its app, you can build your own. And if you don’t like Bluesky’s moderation choices, you can build your own independent service instead.
The Bluesky moderation team has also been expanded with additional hires following two recent surges that brought more users to the service. Though the company hasn’t said how large its moderation team today is, CEO Jay Graber hinted at the team’s size in an interview with Nilay Patel’s Decoder podcast in March, when she remarked, “We’re about 18 across engineering and ops, and then we have about that number on support and moderation.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/amazon-brings-generative-ai-powered-recaps-to-prime-video/,Amazon brings generative AI-powered recaps to Prime Video | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-11-04,"Instead of scouring the internet for a summary of a TV show, which often risks unintentionally revealing major plot points, Prime Video’s latest feature aims to save viewers from encountering any spoilers.
Amazon announced on Monday the launch of “X-Ray Recaps,” a generative AI-powered feature that creates concise summaries of entire seasons, single episodes, and even parts of episodes. Notably, the company claims that guardrails were put in place to ensure the AI doesn’t generate spoilers, so you can fully enjoy your favorite series without the anxiety of stumbling upon unwanted information.
The new feature is an expansion of the streamers’ existing X-Ray feature, which displays information when you pause the screen, such as details about the cast and other trivia.
To use Recaps, visit the detail page of a TV show, where a new rewind icon will allow you to select from three choices: recap the current episode, recap the entire season so far, or recap the previous season.
X-Ray Recaps is currently in beta and will only be available to Fire TV customers in the U.S. to start. At launch, users can access the feature on all Amazon MGM Studios original titles, including “Daisy Jones & the Six,” “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” “The Wheel of Time,” and “The Boys.”
It’ll roll out to additional devices at the end of the year.
As the company explained in its blog post, the feature leverages a combination of custom AI models (built with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker) to analyze video, subtitles, and dialogue to describe key events, conversations, and other information.
Amazon also noted that the feature is fully personalized to align with the precise moment you’re watching. So, whether you’re just a few minutes into a new episode, midway through a season, or returning to a series you forgot about, X-Ray Recaps can provide brief snippets of scenes happening in real time.
Prime Video’s announcement comes on the heels of rival Google TV releasing AI-generated summaries, a similar tool that creates brief synopses of TV shows and movies."

An issue with the new display has left Colorsoft buyers leaving unfavorable reviews. At last count, the e-reader is hovering around 2.7 stars.
The company confirmed the display issues that are affecting a “small number” of units in a statement sent to TechCrunch.
“We’re aware of a small number of reports from customers who see a yellow band along the bottom of the display,” Amazon says. “We take the quality of our products seriously and are looking into it. If customers notice this on their device, they can reach out to our customer service team.”
Amazon has yet to acknowledge reports like this one from Good E-Reader stating that the company has pushed back shipping on units as it scrambles to find a software fix."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/regulators-deliver-successive-blows-to-amazon-and-metas-nuclear-power-ambitions/,Regulators deliver successive blows to Amazon and Meta’s nuclear power ambitions | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-04,"Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have placed big bets on nuclear power to secure electricity for their data centers as AI and cloud computing have sent power use surging.
But as Amazon and Meta discovered last week, those bets are far from a sure thing. A series of recent rulings from regulators dashed their hopes of finding a quick fix for their electricity needs. For now, Microsoft’s plans to revive a reactor at Three Mile Island are moving ahead.
Perhaps unexpectedly, the roadblocks have nothing to do with nuclear power itself, illustrating the challenges of building massive data centers without first locking up new sources of electricity.
Meta, for example, is planning to build an AI data center next to an already operating nuclear power plant. But as the project progressed, regulatory hurdles began piling up. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff in an all-hands meeting that one hurdle was the sighting of a rare bee species on the land, according to a Financial Times report. (Many bee populations are currently fragile, at best, after decades of exposure to a new generation of pesticides, among other stressors.)
Amazon’s plans have also hit a snag. The company is planning to build a new hyperscale data center next to the nuclear power plant near Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, and use a significant portion of the plant’s electricity. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees the U.S. electricity and natural gas grids, voted 2-1 on November 1 to deny the expansion of an existing data center power agreement that would have allowed Amazon to connect directly to the power plant.
The concern in Amazon’s case was that other customers would potentially suffer lower reliability — brownouts or blackouts — and higher costs as the data center would divert a significant portion of the massive power plant away from the rest of the region’s electricity grid.
This likely won’t be the last time FERC wades into the power question for hyperscale data centers: The commission has at least another eight large co-location requests to review."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/from-lime-to-uber-to-hertz-free-and-discounted-election-day-rides/,From Lime to Uber to Hertz: Free and discounted Election Day rides | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-11-04,"Election Day is nearly here, and if you haven’t already mailed in your ballot or gone in for early voting, you might need a ride come November 5.
Here’s a roundup of all the freebies, discounts, and information on getting to the polls that transportation companies are offering.
Lime is offering free rides to and from your polling place to vote early or on Election Day. Riders can use the promo code VOTE2024 to get two free 30-minute rides in the U.S.
Bird and Spin are also offering two free rides as part of their Roll to the Polls initiative. Riders can use the code RockTheVote2024 in the app.
“We believe voting should be accessible to everyone, and this initiative is our way of helping residents overcome transportation barriers to make their voices heard,” a Lyft spokesperson told TechCrunch.
Veo is also running a promo for Election Day across all of its markets. Riders can get $5 in credit with the code VOTE24 now through Election Day.
Lyft is dishing out 50% discounts (but capping out at $10 — classic) to riders heading to the polls. Users can preload the ride code VOTE24 on or before November 5. And this not only goes for ride-hail, but also bikeshare (like Citi Bike) and scootershare.
For a slightly better deal on the Lyft app, you can tap into the NAACP’s discount offer to get up to $20 off for two rides ($40 total) October 29 through November 5. Use the code NAACPVOTE24, and do it fast! It’s first come, first serve.
Uber is also offering riders 50% off trips (again, only up to $10) to their polling places when they click on the “Go Vote!” tile in the Uber app. The app also helps users find their nearest polling station.
And on Election Day, Uber Eats is offering 25% off orders up to $15, with a $25 minimum. The offer will last from 6 p.m. local time to 7 a.m. local time on November 6 — you know, in case you need to eat your feelings.
Hertz is offering one free day for customers who rent two or more days between October 21 and November 5 in “participating neighborhoods.” Drivers can use the promo code 211636 at the time of reservation, and they won’t be able to book convertibles, minivans, or large SUVs.
Zipcar offered thousands of vehicles on the platform for free during the 2016 voting season. This year, the company is waiving the first month membership fee for new members who want to use the Zipcar to get to the polls. The code is MONTHOFF.
Google is once again providing official information about in-person voting and ballot dropbox locations both on Search and on Maps, with the latter showing information about hours and the types of voting offered at specific locations. The information comes from the Voting Information Project, a partnership between state and local election officials and nonpartisan civic organization Democracy Works.
Moovit has integrated tens of thousands of polling locations from 130 counties across 11 states into its trip-planning app. The app also provides users with quick access to voter registration information and which transit agencies are offering free rides.
There are countless transit agencies offering free rides on Election Day — everywhere from Detroit to Des Moines to Durham — so be sure to check with your local authority.
“Free bus rides all day on Election Day will most definitely encourage voter turnout since for many Durham residents, public transit is a practical way to get to the polls. By removing the cost barrier, we hope more registered voters will cast a ballot on Nov. 5 as well as in all future election years,” Derek Bowens, the director of the Durham County Board of Elections, said in a news release.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/anthropic-hikes-the-price-of-its-haiku-model/,Anthropic hikes the price of its Haiku model | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-04,"Anthropic’s newest AI model has arrived. But it’s pricier than the last generation, and unlike Anthropic’s other models, it can’t analyze images just yet.
Claude 3.5 Haiku, which Anthropic announced last month, matches or bests the performance of Anthropic’s flagship model, Claude 3 Opus, on specific benchmarks. Available through Anthropic’s API and a number of third-party platforms, including AWS Bedrock, Claude 3.5 Haiku is useful for coding suggestions, data extraction and labeling, and content moderation, Anthropic says.
Anthropic previously suggested that Claude 3.5 Haiku would cost the same as Claude 3 Haiku, its predecessor. Now it’s changing its tune.
“During final testing, Haiku surpassed Claude 3 Opus, our previous flagship model, on many benchmarks — at a fraction of the cost. As a result, we’ve increased pricing for Claude 3.5 Haiku to reflect its increase in intelligence,” Anthropic wrote in a post on X.
Pricing for Claude 3.5 Haiku starts at $1 per million input tokens (~750,000 words) and $5 per million output tokens. That’s versus 25 cents per million input tokens and $1.25 per million output tokens for Claude 3 Haiku — a 4x hike.
Claude 3.5 Haiku also isn’t launching with image analysis features, making it less capable in at least one respect compared to Claude 3 Haiku. Alex Albert, head of developer relations at Anthropic, said on X that Claude 3 Haiku will remain available “for users requiring maximum cost-efficiency and image processing.”
Granted, Claude 3.5 Haiku can output longer chunks of text than Claude 3 Haiku, and the model has a more recent knowledge cutoff (meaning it can reference more recent events). Still, it’s rare for an AI vendor to raise the cost of a model in a series — and raises questions about Anthropic’s pricing strategy moving forward."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/the-brightest-bling-of-techcrunch-disrupt-2024/,The brightest bling of TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 | TechCrunch,"Amanda Silberling, Sarah Perez",2024-11-04,"At TechCrunch Disrupt, our team sits front and center, furiously typing away at our laptops to publish real-time news from impressive speakers like NFL quarterback-turned-founder Colin Kaepernick, Perplexity AI founder Aravind Srinivas, and Ashton Kutcher. We are a well-oiled machine. Some writers have been covering Disrupt since the old days, before Meta was Meta and before the show “Silicon Valley” gave us the free marketing of a lifetime (thank you, HBO). And yet, this year, even the longest-tenured TechCrunch editors were a bit distracted by the stunning jewelry gracing the stage. So, for those of you who were more focused on the actual substance of these conversations with influential tech players, fret not. Behold: our shimmering roundup of the best bling at TechCrunch Disrupt.
Google, if you’re listening, I have a pitch for the next Google Lens commercial. So imagine a group of TechCrunch writers are watching their editor-in-chief host a thoughtful, informative conversation with Matt Mullenweg, the WordPress founder who’s been in the news for his battles with WP Engine. But almost as interesting as Mullenweg’s comments onstage is his watch, a $240,000 fashion statement. The watch’s sapphire detail alone takes over 185 hours to make, according to the website of designer Maximilian Büsser. How did we figure out exactly what bling Mullenweg was wearing? That’s right, Google. We used Circle to Search.
Why is this watch, which is inspired by the design of the Kitty Hawk aircraft, so expensive? The designer’s website states: “Every component and form has a technical purpose; nothing is superfluous and every line and curve is in poetic harmony. Articulated lugs ensure supreme comfort. Highly legible time is a fringe benefit.”
Yes, it’s ridiculous to buy a bracelet for the cost of a house. But hey, we all spend impulsively sometimes — for example, I spent an extra $2 at the grocery store this weekend to buy presliced mangoes. This is definitely the same kind of frivolity.
What’s fascinating about Mary Barra’s bling is its utility. She’s got one diamond ring on each hand, yet beneath the sleeve of her high-end houndstooth blazer (is this the one?), we see an Apple Watch peeking out. Barra’s choice of jewelry displays the duality of the role of the modern CEO: You need to act polished and elegant on the exterior, but when no one’s watching, you still need to be efficient and reliable. And, like my own Apple Watch SE and its disappointing battery life, you can’t survive unless you recharge your batteries each night.
Slack CEO Denise Dresser gets some style points: Her rings aren’t just bling for the sake of bling, like a massive wedding ring that could rival Mullenweg’s aircraft watch in price. Dresser’s bling has a bit of spunk. One ring is a large gold square, which seems like it might have a maroon-ish band, or it could be the reflection of light. We may never know. The other ring … I want to say it looks like an octopus signet, but I can’t tell.
Nest founder Tony Fadell’s interview at Disrupt was explosive — while he took shots at Sam Altman, we also couldn’t look away from his large ruby ring. Unfortunately, Google Lens is coming up empty here, even though our source image is pretty clear. This ring could be an $8,400 designer ring — it could also be $10 costume jewelry from Amazon. The truth is probably somewhere closer to the middle.
Update: former TechCrunch editor Darrell Etherington has identified Fadell’s watch as a Ressence Type 5, a “world-proof diver watch” that retails for around $35,000. We thank Darrell for his service.
Erin Foster was already well-known for her various pursuits with her sister Sara, including a hit podcast, clothing line, and venture firm. She and her sister were even co-heads of creative at Bumble. But now Erin Foster has reached a new level of fame: She’s the creator of the Netflix show “Nobody Wants This,” which has remained on the top of the Netflix charts since its premiere in September.
What does Foster’s TV writing success have to do with her bling? That’s not just a ring: it’s a wedding ring. The central romance of “Nobody Wants This” — a sex podcaster and a rabbi — was inspired in part by her own experience falling in love with a Jewish man and navigating their cultural differences. If there’s a wedding on “Nobody Wants This,” we can only hope that Kristen Bell’s character’s ring is as spectacular.
Jingna Zhang isn’t just the founder of a social platform Cara. She’s an artist. And as an artist, she knows a thing or two about style — after all, her photographs have appeared in global fashion magazines like Vogue, Elle, and Harper’s Bazaar. At Disrupt, she goes for a look that highlights her jewelry: all black, head to toe, save for a big shiny jewel on her left hand.
Brandie Nonnecke may be an academic, but her bling is on point — it’s giving tenure. Her gold, crinkle-effect earrings could be from anywhere — the style is quite popular, ranging from cheap Shein dupes, to midrange gold-plated studs, to more expensive looks from a designer that I wish I hadn’t just discovered, because now I wish I had a spare $400 to buy these earrings.
Nonnecke studies and teaches AI policy, and if you’re reading this, Brandie, I have good news: Google Lens has no idea where your ring is from, and with the exception of Mullenweg’s watch and Barra’s jacket, it has proven very unhelpful at writing this post. Maybe our robot overlords aren’t closing in on us as quickly as we imagined."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/anduril-is-considering-arizona-ohio-or-texas-for-its-massive-manufacturing-facility-source-says/,"Anduril is considering Arizona, Ohio, or Texas for its massive manufacturing facility, source says | TechCrunch",Marina Temkin,2024-11-04,"Anduril, the defense tech company co-founded by Palmer Luckey, is considering building its first major manufacturing plant, a 5-million-square-foot facility known as “Arsenal-1,” in Arizona, Ohio, or Texas, according to someone familiar with the matter.
The company, which is developing autonomous drones, planes, and submarines, had announced $1.5 billion at a $14 billion post-money valuation in September.
In conjunction with that round, Anduril announced it plans to use the fresh capital for manufacturing, investing “hundreds of millions” to develop its Arsenal-1 facility. It also said it would use the money for hiring and promised that the facility will employ “thousands of people” and be capable of producing “tens of thousands of autonomous military systems annually.”
When TechCrunch asked an Anduril spokesperson if the company was now choosing between these three locations for its factory, she responded, “That is incorrect” but would not specify what exactly was incorrect.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Air Force chose Anduril to develop and test small unmanned fighter jets. The company beat out Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman for the deal, a significant win for the 7-year-old VC-backed business.  (A surveillance aircraft company, General Atomics, was also selected as an awardee to modernize the Air Force fleet.)
Anduril is currently manufacturing its systems in Georgia, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Australia, according to its website.  While these locations are providing the company with “significant manufacturing capacity,” Anduril wants the new facility to become a prototype of a faster, cheaper, software-defined factory for building weapons, one that is able to increase production rapidly and nimbly.
This is in contrast to the kind of typical bespoke defense and aerospace contractor manufacturing today, which makes each part costly to change. Anduril is not the only VC-backed defense tech company working on the manufacturing part of the problem. As TechCrunch previously reported, a group of former Anduril engineers launched a startup called Salient Motion to do this for the aerospace industry and was promptly sued by Anduril. The suit has since been settled. Others, like Ursa Major, are working on making rocket motors through 3D printing.
Although Anduril’s headquarters are in Costa Mesa, California, and will remain there, our source says, the majority of the company’s staff will likely be based at Arsenal-1. Arizona, Texas, and Ohio are all fairly common sense potential choices, as all are states where defense contractors and other types of manufacturing facilities abound.
Investors in Anduril’s last round include Founders Fund, Sands Capital, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and Baillie Gifford."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/meta-says-its-making-its-llama-models-available-for-us-national-security-applications/,Meta says it's making its Llama models available for US national security applications | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-04,"To combat the perception that its “open” AI is aiding foreign adversaries, Meta today said that it’s making its Llama series of AI models available to U.S. government agencies and contractors in national security.
“We are pleased to confirm that we’re making Llama available to U.S. government agencies, including those that are working on defense and national security applications, and private sector partners supporting their work,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “We’re partnering with companies including Accenture, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Booz Allen, Databricks, Deloitte, IBM, Leidos, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Oracle, Palantir, Scale AI, and Snowflake to bring Llama to government agencies.”
Oracle, for example, is using Llama to process aircraft maintenance documents, Meta says. Scale AI is fine-tuning Llama to support specific national security team missions. And Lockheed Martin is offering Llama to its defense customers for use cases like generating computer code.
Meta’s policy normally forbids developers from using Llama for any projects related to military, warfare, or espionage missions. But the company’s making an exception in this case, it told Bloomberg, and exceptions for similar government agencies (and contractors) in the U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
Last week, Reuters reported that Chinese research scientists linked to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the military wing of China’s ruling party, used an older Llama model, Llama 2, to develop a tool for defense applications. Chinese researchers, including two affiliated with a PLA R&D group, created a military-focused chatbot designed to gather and process intelligence, as well as offer information for operational decision-making.
Meta told Reuters in a statement that the use of the “single, and outdated” Llama model was “unauthorized” and contrary to its acceptable use policy. But the report added much fuel to the ongoing debate over the merits and risks of open AI.
The use of AI, open or “closed,” for defense is controversial.
According to a recent study from the nonprofit AI Now Institute, the AI deployed today for military intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance poses dangers because it relies on personal data that can be exfiltrated and weaponized by adversaries. It also has vulnerabilities, like biases and a tendency to hallucinate, that are currently without remedy, write the co-authors, who recommend creating AI that’s separate and isolated from “commercial” models.
Employees at several Big Tech companies, including Google and Microsoft, have protested their employer’s contracts to build AI tools and infrastructure for the U.S. military.
Meta asserts that open AI can accelerate defense research while promoting America’s “economic and security interests.” But the U.S. military has been slow to adopt the technology — and skeptical of its ROI. So far, the U.S. Army is the only branch of the U.S. armed forces with a generative AI deployment.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/columbus-says-ransomware-gang-stole-personal-data-of-500000-ohio-residents/,"Columbus says ransomware gang stole personal data of 500,000 Ohio residents | TechCrunch",Carly Page,2024-11-04,"The City of Columbus, Ohio’s state capital, has confirmed that hackers stole the personal data of 500,000 residents during a July ransomware attack.
In a filing with Maine’s attorney general, Columbus confirmed that a “foreign cyber threat actor” compromised its network to access information including residents’ names, dates of birth, addresses, identification documents, Social Security numbers, and bank account details.
The city, which is the most populous in Ohio with approximately 900,000 residents, says around half a million individuals were affected, though it has not confirmed the exact number of victims.
The regulatory filing comes after Columbus was the target of a ransomware attack on July 18 of this year, which the city claimed to have “thwarted” by disconnecting its network from the internet.
Rhysida, the ransomware gang responsible for last year’s British Library cyberattack, claimed responsibility for the attack against Columbus in August. At the time, the gang said it had stolen 6.5 terabytes of data from the city in Ohio, including “databases, internal logins and passwords of employees, a full dump of servers with emergency services applications of the city and … access from city video cameras,” according to local news reports.
Rhysida asked for 30 bitcoin, around $1.9 million at the time of the cyberattack, as payment for the stolen data.
Two weeks after the cyberattack, Columbus mayor Andrew Ginther told the public the stolen data was likely “corrupted” and “unusable.”
The accuracy of Ginther’s statement was thrown into doubt the following day after David Leroy Ross, a cybersecurity researcher also known as Connor Goodwolf, revealed that the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Columbus residents had been listed on the dark web.
In September, Columbus sued Ross, alleging that he was “threatening to share the City’s stolen data with third parties who would otherwise have no readily available means by which to obtain the City’s stolen data.” A judge filed a temporary restraining order against Ross, preventing him from accessing the stolen data.
In a listing on its leak site, seen by TechCrunch on Monday, Rhysida claims to have uploaded 3.1 terabytes of “unsold” data stolen from Columbus, amounting to more than 250,000 files."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/no-startups-shouldnt-always-take-the-highest-valuation-seed-vcs-say/,"No, startups shouldn’t always take the highest valuation, seed VCs say | TechCrunch",Julie Bort,2024-11-04,"One of the lessons that the wild Silicon Valley venture funding environment of the past few years has clearly taught is this: Bigger valuations are not always better.
“I think we’ve all kind of seen the negative impact of having a valuation too high from the last, call it, three years,” Elizabeth Yin, co-founder of Hustle Fund said onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 last week. When a VC bull market hits and startups are able to easily raise a lot of money before they have real, provable businesses, they’ve set themselves up for difficult times.
Because “the bar is higher for that next round,” she said. The general rule is for each early round, business growth should justify double, or possibly triple, the previous valuation, Yin said.
So early valuations “shouldn’t be anything really crazy that you don’t think you can grow into realistically with your traction, because it always catches up with you,” she said.
If the company fails to grow into a lofty valuation, it could wind up burning its most valuable employees, said VC Renata Quintini, co-founder of Renegade Partners.
Most startups grant stock to employees, or sometimes grant stock options — which the employee is required to buy. And most startups offer that stock as a significant portion of their employees’ salaries. People join startups because they believe if they help build the company, their stock will pay off. So, obviously, it is not good if employees’ stock grows less valuable over time.
“If that gap doesn’t close, you’re actually disincentivizing the people that joined you early on,” Quintini warns.
A much better way to raise money is to “create a tight process,” by setting reasonable valuation expectations from the get-go, VC Corinne Riley, partner at Greylock, said onstage. “You don’t want to be dillydallying and have a multi-month round. You’re wasting your own time. You’re wasting the VC time,” she said. “You want to know exactly how much you want to raise.”
Quintini advises founders to have ranges in mind for both an amount and a valuation. To do that, she says, a founder should spend more time in an information-gathering phase than in an actual pitching phase.
They should ask VCs in their network their opinions on their valuation. They should know what type of market they are in and what the multiples on revenue or other pricing metrics are in vogue for their area at the moment. They should carefully consider how much dilution they are willing to take — that is, how much of their company they are willing to sell off and how much of a stake they will retain after the round.
Should the founder want to sell a smaller stake — 10% versus the more typical 20% — the founder should find out which firms would even entertain that idea. Many firms won’t bother with small stakes, as that decreases their chances for a big return.
Coming into the pitch meeting wanting too much for too little means “you better have a fantastic business and be an outlier company to back it up; otherwise, you’re actually going to be turning VCs off,” Quintini says.
If a VC comes in with a term sheet that wildly beats all the others in valuation, founders should look at the fine print. Has the VC banked the term sheet toward giving its firm outsized power? This could also mean that the company won’t be able to convince other VCs to invest in later rounds.
Startup accelerator Y Combinator distributes a sample term sheet that shows off what most VCs consider standard terms. These cover everything from voting rights to board seats.
“I’ve definitely seen a number of my founders, especially international companies, get all kinds of term sheets with all kinds of terms that I would consider nonstandard,” Yin described, such as “weird board configurations” like the VC wanting multiple board seats, or “all kinds of liquidation” preferences. Anything above a “1x” liquidation preference means that the investor gets paid out more money, and first, should the company sell and isn’t standard.
In addition to being prepared to negotiate on dollar amount, valuation, and stake size, founders should be prepared to negotiate board composition and items like who gets to choose the independent board members. Whatever you decide on the terms that give VCs power could impact your company, and its future valuations, forever.
“I encourage our founders to turn the very nonstandard things down. And then there are some others that are borderline. And maybe you take it because you don’t have any other options, but, once it’s done, it’s really hard to unwind,” Yin says."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/chatgpt-search-is-not-openais-google-killer-yet/,ChatGPT Search is not OpenAI's 'Google killer' yet | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-11-04,"Last week, OpenAI released its highly anticipated search product, ChatGPT Search, to take on Google. The industry has been bracing for this moment for months, prompting Google to inject AI-generated answers into its core product earlier this year and producing some embarrassing hallucinations in the process. That mishap led many people to believe that OpenAI’s search engine would truly be a “Google killer.”
But after using ChatGPT Search as my default search engine (you can, too, with OpenAI’s extension) for roughly a day, I quickly switched back to Google. OpenAI’s search product was impressive in some ways and offered a glimpse of what an AI-search interface could one day look like. But for now, it’s still too impractical to use as my daily driver.
ChatGPT Search was occasionally useful for surfacing real-time answers to questions that I would have otherwise had to dig through many ads and SEO-optimized articles to find. Like others in this AI search category like Perplexity and You.com, it presents concise answers in a nice format: You get links to the information’s sources on the right side; the headlines and short snippets give you a quick reality check on the AI-generated text.
However, it often just felt impractical for everyday use.
In its current form, ChatGPT Search is unreliable for what people use Google for the most: short, navigational queries. Queries shorter than four words represent the bulk of searches on Google; these are often just a few keywords that get you to the right web page, often one the user knows but doesn’t want to bother typing out. They’re the kind of searches most people are barely even conscious they’re making all day, and it’s what Google tends to do very well.
I’m talking about “Celtics score,” “cotton socks,” “library hours,” “San Francisco weather,” “cafes near me,” and other queries that make Google the front door to the internet for billions of people.
My test run with ChatGPT Search was quite frustrating at times, and it made me conscious of just how many keyword searches I perform in a day. I couldn’t reliably find information using short queries, and for the first time in years, I actually longed for Google Search.
Don’t get me wrong: Google has declined in quality for the last decade or so, largely because it’s been flooded with ads, SEO, and questionable AI summaries. Still, I kept opening Google in a separate window during my test because ChatGPT Search couldn’t get me a correct answer or web page.
I typed in “Nuggets score” to check how a live NBA game between the Denver Nuggets and the Minnesota Timberwolves was going. ChatGPT told me the Nuggets were winning even though they were actually losing, and showed a Timberwolves score that was 10 points lower than it really was, according to a Google result at the same time.
Another time, I tried “earnings today,” to check the companies reporting quarterly results that could affect stock prices on Friday. ChatGPT told me that Apple and Amazon were reporting their results on Friday, even though both companies had already reported a day earlier. In other words, it hallucinated and made up information.
In another test, I typed in a tech executive’s name to find their contact information. ChatGPT showed me a summary of the person’s Facebook profile, and hallucinated a link to their LinkedIn page, which produced an error message when I clicked it.
Another time, I typed in “baggy denim jeans,” hoping to shop. ChatGPT Search described to me what baggy denim jeans were in the first place (a definition I didn’t need), and recommended I go to Amazon.com for a nice pair.
I could go on, but you get the idea. Broken links, hallucinations, and random answers defined my first day using ChatGPT Search.
This was not an insignificant launch for OpenAI. Sam Altman praised the feature for being “really good,” even though he’s known for downplaying his startup’s AI capabilities. The reason this time is different may have something to do with search being one of the biggest businesses on the internet, and OpenAI’s version could be a real threat to its biggest competitor, Google.
To be fair, Google Search is a 25-year-old product and ChatGPT Search is brand new. In a blog post, OpenAI says it plans to improve the feature based on user feedback in the coming months, and it seems more than likely this could be a significant area of investment for the startup.
To its credit, ChatGPT Search is rather good at answering long, written-out research questions. Something like, “What American professional sports league has the most diversity?” isn’t a question you could easily answer with Google, but ChatGPT Search is pretty good at scraping multiple websites and getting you a decent answer in just a couple of seconds. (Perplexity is also pretty good at these questions, and its search product has been around for well over a year.)
Compared to the traditional version of ChatGPT, which already had web access, the search feature feels like a better interface for browsing the web. There are more clear links to the sources where ChatGPT gets its information now — for news stories, ChatGPT will be tapping the media companies that it’s been striking all those licensing deals with.
The problem is that most searches on Google are not such long questions. To really replace Google, OpenAI needs to improve these more practical, short searches people are already making throughout their day.
OpenAI is not shy about the fact that ChatGPT Search struggles with short queries.
“With ChatGPT search, we’ve observed that users tend to start asking questions in more natural ways than they have in the past with other search tools,” said OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “At the same time—web navigational queries—which tend to be short, are quite common. We plan to improve the experience for these types of queries over time.”
That said, these short keyword queries have made Google indispensable, and until OpenAI gets them right, Google is still going to be the mainstay for many people.
There are a couple reasons why OpenAI might be struggling with these short queries. The first is that ChatGPT relies on Microsoft Bing, which is widely regarded as an inferior engine compared to Google.
The second reason is that large language models may generally just not be well-suited to these short prompts. LLMs typically need fully written-out questions to produce effective answers, because that helps create a strong statistical pattern for them to complete: it doesn’t know that people searching for “cotton socks” are almost all trying to shop for them, rather than learn about the origin of the garment. Perhaps there needs to be some re-prompting — running short queries through an LLM as a longer question — before ChatGPT Search can do such searches well.
Though OpenAI has only now released its search product, Perplexity’s own AI search tool is already serving 100 million search queries a week. Perplexity has also been touted as a “Google killer,” but it runs into the same problems with short queries.
Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of Perplexity, discussed how people use his product differently compared to Google Search at TechCrunch Disrupt. “The median number of words in a Google query is somewhere between two and three,” he said at the event. “In Perplexity, it’s around 10 to 11 words. So clearly, more of the usage in Perplexity is people coming and directly being able to ask a question. On the other hand, at Google, you’re typing in a few key words to instantly get to a certain link.”
I think the fact that people are not using these products for web navigation presents a bigger problem than OpenAI or Perplexity are letting on. It means that ChatGPT Search and Perplexity are not replacing Google Search for the task it’s best at: web navigation.
Instead, these AI products are filling a new niche, surfacing information that gets buried in traditional search. Don’t get me wrong, that’s valuable in its own right.
OpenAI and Perplexity both claim they will work on getting better at these short queries. Until then, I don’t think either of these products can fully replace Google. If OpenAI wants to replace the front door to the internet, it has to create a better one."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/u-s-laws-regulating-ai-prove-elusive-but-there-may-be-hope/,"US laws regulating AI prove elusive, but there may be hope | TechCrunch",Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-04,"Can the U.S. meaningfully regulate AI? It’s not at all clear yet. Policymakers have achieved progress in recent months, but they’ve also had setbacks, illustrating the challenging nature of laws imposing guardrails on the technology.
In March, Tennessee became the first state to protect voice artists from unauthorized AI cloning. This summer, Colorado adopted a tiered, risk-based approach to AI policy. And in September, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed dozens of AI-related safety bills, a few of which require companies to disclose details about their AI training.
But the U.S. still lacks a federal AI policy comparable to the EU’s AI Act. Even at the state level, regulation continues to encounter major roadblocks.
After a protracted battle with special interests, Governor Newsom vetoed bill SB 1047, a law that would have imposed wide-ranging safety and transparency requirements on companies developing AI. Another California bill targeting the distributors of AI deepfakes on social media was stayed this fall pending the outcome of a lawsuit.
There’s reason for optimism, however, according to Jessica Newman, co-director of the AI Policy Hub at UC Berkeley. Speaking on a panel about AI governance at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, Newman noted that many federal bills might not have been written with AI in mind, but still apply to AI — like anti-discrimination and consumer protection legislation.
“We often hear about the U.S. being this kind of ‘Wild West’ in comparison to what happens in the EU,” Newman said, “but I think that is overstated, and the reality is more nuanced than that.”
To Newman’s point, the Federal Trade Commission has forced companies surreptitiously harvesting data to delete their AI models, and is investigating whether the sales of AI startups to big tech companies violates antitrust regulation. Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission has declared AI-voiced robocalls illegal, and has floated a rule that AI-generated content in political advertising be disclosed.
President Joe Biden has also attempted to get certain AI rules on the books. Roughly a year ago, Biden signed the AI Executive Order, which props up the voluntary reporting and benchmarking practices many AI companies were already choosing to implement.
One consequence of the executive order was the U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI), a federal body that studies risks in AI systems. Operating within the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the AISI has research partnerships with major AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic.
Yet, the AISI could be wound down with a simple repeal of Biden’s executive order. In October, a coalition of more than 60 organizations called on Congress to enact legislation codifying the AISI before year’s end.
“I think that all of us, as Americans, share an interest in making sure that we mitigate the potential downsides of technology,” AISI director Elizabeth Kelly, who also participated in the panel, said.
So is there hope for comprehensive AI regulation in the States? The failure of SB 1047, which Newman described as a “light touch” bill with input from industry, isn’t exactly encouraging. Authored by California State Senator Scott Wiener, SB 1047 was opposed by many in Silicon Valley, including high-profile technologists like Meta’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun.
This being the case, Wiener, another Disrupt panelist, said he wouldn’t have drafted the bill any differently — and he’s confident broad AI regulation will eventually prevail.
“I think it set the stage for future efforts,” he said. “Hopefully, we can do something that can bring more folks together, because the reality all of the large labs have already acknowledged is that the risks [of AI] are real and we want to test for them.”
Indeed, Anthropic last week warned of AI catastrophe if governments don’t implement regulation in the next 18 months.
Opponents have only doubled down on their rhetoric. Last Monday, Khosla Ventures founder Vinod Khosla called Wiener “totally clueless” and “not qualified” to regulate the real dangers of AI. And Microsoft and Andreessen Horowitz released a statement rallying against AI regulations that might affect their financial interests.
Newman posits, though, that pressure to unify the growing state-by-state patchwork of AI rules will ultimately yield a stronger legislative solution. In lieu of consensus on a model of regulation, state policymakers have introduced close to 700 pieces of AI legislation this year alone.
“My sense is that companies don’t want an environment of a patchwork regulatory system where every state is different,” she said, “and I think there will be increasing pressure to have something at the federal level that provides more clarity and reduces some of that uncertainty.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/vanguard-cuts-ola-valuation-to-2-billion/,Vanguard cuts Indian rideshare startup Ola's valuation to $2B | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-11-04,"Vanguard has revised its valuation of Indian ride-hailing startup Ola to about $2 billion as of the end of August, according to a regulatory filing.
A U.S. asset manager’s fund disclosed in a filing that it values its holding in ANI Technologies, the parent firm of Ola, at about $14.3 million, compared to some $51 million it spent to acquire those shares.
The disclosure implies a valuation of about $2 billion for the Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which was valued at $7.3 billion in late 2021. Ola competes with Uber, Swiggy-backed Rapido, and Google-backed Moving Tech in India’s ride-hailing market.
The valuation adjustment follows previous cuts by Vanguard, including one in August 2023 that valued the company at about $2.6 billion.
Bhavish Aggarwal co-founded Ola in 2010. Ola Electric, which spun out of Ola Cabs several years ago, went public earlier this year and commands a market cap of $4.2 billion. His third venture, AI startup Krutrim, raised its first funding round earlier this year at a valuation of $1 billion."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/03/threads-now-has-275m-monthly-active-users/,Threads now has 275M monthly active users | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-11-04,"Meta’s social network, Threads, now has 275 million monthly active users (MAUs), the company said on Sunday.
“Yesterday we crossed 275M monthly active users on @Threads. A big thank you to everyone who’s helped us get this far. There’s a lot more to do, and plenty of things to fix, but there’s something exciting about this place,” said Adam Mosseri, the Meta executive who heads Threads and Instagram.
Threads, which launched in July 2023 in a bid to capitalize on the millions of users leaving X after Elon Musk bought the platform, has rapidly gained users and has now become one of the biggest text-first social networks. The platform reached the 150 million MAU mark in April and 200 million MAUs in August, meaning it has gained 75 million active users in just three months.
Last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company’s Q3 2024 post-results conference call that a million people sign up to Threads every day.
While the platform’s user acquisition is trending upwards, Threads is facing a number of moderation issues that have frustrated users."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/03/x-updates-block-feature-letting-blocked-users-see-your-public-posts/,"X updates block feature, letting blocked users see your public posts | TechCrunch",Ivan Mehta,2024-11-04,"X is rolling out its controversial update to the block feature, allowing people to view your public posts even if you have blocked them. People have protested this change, arguing that they don’t want blocked users to see their posts for reasons of safety.
Blocked users still can’t follow the person who has blocked them, engage with their posts, or send direct messages to them.
An old version of X’s support page says blocked users couldn’t see a user’s following and followers lists. The company has now updated the page to remove that reference, and it now allows users to see the following and followers lists of the people who have blocked them.
The social network said its logic behind this change was that the block feature can be used to share and hide harmful or private information about someone, and its new iteration would result in more transparency. This mostly falls flat, given that X allows users to make their accounts private and share information.
X’s take on the block feature goes against how it’s been implemented conventionally, and when the company announced its intention to revamp it, many argued that the change would encourage stalking and make it easy for people to harass users.
Software engineer and tech diversity advocate Tracy Chou has built an app that lets users automate blocking, saying that even though users can get around the block by creating other accounts, friction matters.
“Making it easy for the creeper to creep is not a good thing,” she said in a post on X last month."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/03/affirm-launches-in-the-uk-as-buy-now-pay-later-market-faces-regulatory-overhaul/,"Affirm launches in the UK as 'buy now, pay later' market faces regulatory overhaul | TechCrunch",Paul Sawers,2024-11-04,"Buy now, pay later (BNPL) giant Affirm is launching in the U.K., its first market outside North America.
Affirm’s long-anticipated arrival comes as U.K. lawmakers mull new rules to bring BNPL firms into line with other traditional consumer credit services, though such laws aren’t expected to come into effect until at least 2026 — long enough for Affirm to build traction and curry favor with consumers and regulators alike.
Founded in 2012, Affirm emerged from a startup incubator called HVF that was set up by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin (pictured above), who eventually took the reins at Affirm in 2014 to drive its commercial push.
The company expanded beyond the U.S. and into Canada in 2022, and it has struck lucrative partnerships with major e-commerce companies through the years. Affirm has been Shopify’s major financing partner for close to a decade, it has a partnership with Walmart, and Amazon last year tapped Affirm as the first BNPL partner for Amazon Pay in the U.S. More recently, Affirm also secured Apple as a customer.
The BNPL model is simple: Customers are invited to purchase goods on credit, and can repay the debt in several interest-free installments. The BNPL provider monetizes through merchant fees, or if a customer requires a longer repayment period, the loan may include interest, too.
The BNPL market has long been on the U.K. regulatory radar, with incumbents such as Klarna and Clearpay often criticized for encouraging impulse buying and normalizing debt. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has hitherto had some power to keep BNPL providers in check, but there are key exemptions, such as services that involve interest-free credit, where fixed-sum agreements stipulate that debts be repaid within 12 months.
But new rules in the works could bring BNPL companies fully in line with other consumer credit companies. The Labour government last month announced a fresh BNPL consultation, with plans to introduce regulation to “ensure people using BNPL products receive clear information, avoid unaffordable borrowing, and have strong rights when issues arise.”
It’s clear that Affirm is already pushing to position itself favorably both with patrons and the powers that be. Indeed, the company noted for the U.K. launch that its interest-bearing payment options won’t involve compound interest — instead, interest will be fixed and calculated entirely on the original amount borrowed.
It’s also worth noting that Klarna started charging late fees in the U.K. last year, and this is one area where Affirm is setting out to differentiate — it says it won’t be charging late fees or any other “hidden charges.”
It has been a bumpy few years for the BNPL sector. Klarna was valued at more than $45 billion in 2021, a figure that swiftly plummeted by 85% to $6.5 billion following the great post-pandemic “correction” many companies endured. However, news emerged last week that Klarna’s valuation has risen again to $14.6 billion. It has been a similarly turbulent time for Affirm, whose ups and downs have followed a trajectory reminiscent of its European rival.
Following its 2021 IPO, Affirm saw its market cap hit the giddy heights of $47 billion, but its stock took a giant hit afterwards, and its market capitalization dropped below $3 billion last year. However, Affirm’s shares have surged to more than $13 billion in 2024, partly due to the company reporting a 48% increase in revenue in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier, while losses narrowed to $45 million from $206 million. Levchin also predicted the company would reach profitability in 2025.
We’ve known for some time that the U.K. was likely going to be Affirm’s next port-of-call outside the U.S. and Canada. The firm’s chief revenue officer, Wayne Pommen, went on record this March to say that it would be targeting markets where some of its largest existing partners already have a presence.
Affirm isn’t launching in the U.K. with any of the same big-name partnerships it has back home, but the fact that it counts the likes of Amazon, Shopify, and Apple as customers in the U.S. means that it wouldn’t be a huge stretch to expand such commercial partnerships to the U.K., too.
For now Affirm is going to market with the likes of flight booking site Alternative Airlines and payments processor Fexco. Additional U.K. and international brands are expected to follow.
In the build-up to today’s launch, Affirm told TechCrunch it has already hired about 30 employees, including Ruth Spratt, who’s leading the local charge. It’s also looking to add to its headcount through the remainder of the year. And similar to its remote-first ethos elsewhere, workers aren’t tethered to a particular physical hub.
The company wouldn’t confirm its next plans for growth in Europe or elsewhere, but said that it would be “taking the same disciplined approach” that it has always done to any future expansion."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/03/wesley-chan-on-what-he-looks-for-as-hes-shopping-for-potential-unicorns/,Wesley Chan on what he looks for as he's shopping for potential unicorns | TechCrunch,Matt Rosoff,2024-11-03,"Investor Wesley Chan has shown a knack for making very early investments into multi-billion-dollar unicorns, such as Plaid, Gusto, Flexport, and, most recently, Canva.
Chan comes from an unconventional background — he grew up in an immigrant family and had only middling grades in high school. But he landed a job washing test tubes in a lab at Caltech and impressed lab manager Ellen Rothenberg enough to get her help in getting into MIT.
From there, his serendipitous journey continued: He majored in computer science because it seemed like a good career path, but landed in Silicon Valley just after the dot-com bust, when the only company hiring was a search upstart called Google. After nearly a decade there working on vital products such as Google Analytics, Chan was ready to do his own thing, but co-founder Sergey Brin convinced him to join the company’s nascent venture arm, then called Google Ventures (now GV), and from there he’s had a long career in venture, spinning out his own firm, FPV, with partner Pegah Ebrahimi, a few years ago.
The point of all this is there’s an incredible amount of luck and timing involved in any success story, and Chan is the first to admit it, telling the audience at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, “luck matters a lot, but the best founders who know how to push luck in their favor really have a keen sense of why timing matters.”
He points back to what Brin told him about founding Google, which they started at a particular moment when other search engines were trying to keep users on their sites as long as possible to show them ads. Google’s innovation was delivering results almost immediately, then giving users no particular incentive to stick around, but to send them off on their way. (It’s changed a bit since then.) But Brin said that timing was everything — if they’d started six months earlier or six months later, business conditions would’ve been different and the competition wouldn’t have given them such an easy opening.
So what does Chan look for when he’s trying to pick the next unicorn? He says there are almost no commonalities in the companies he funds except for founders who remind him of Sergey Brin and Larry Page, with a strong conviction that they are solving an urgent and timely problem with truly unique insight. That, and a focus on building a great product first, instead of trying to buy customers or buy growth.
“A lot of challenges for founders in the early stages, they raise money and then they spend it all in 18 months, buying growth, but there’s no reason for people to stay on it, or engage in the product, or tell other people. And then you burn all your money, and you go, oh, I need to raise another round.”
That product focus is also vital if you want to get Chan’s attention. He doesn’t find founders at conferences or events, he says, but only talks to the ones who are introduced to him through word of mouth from other founders in his network.
“There are only two of us at the firm, right? We can’t go take every cold email or every pitch, or every person that shows up at the door. So the best founders come to us through our other founders, right? They build something we either notice or our founders notice. You got to meet this guy. Like, the products, incredible. We’re using it at our board meetings. We’re using at our companies. I have it on my iPhone, right? Or we meet them through our network, where one of our founders really says, ‘I’m putting some money in this guy; he’s amazing.’”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/03/women-in-ai-sophia-velastegui-believes-ai-is-moving-too-fast/,Women in AI: Sophia Velastegui believes AI is moving too fast | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-03,"As a part of TechCrunch’s ongoing Women in AI series, which seeks to give AI-focused women academics and others their well-deserved (and overdue) time in the spotlight, TechCrunch interviewed Sophia Velastegui. Velastegui is a member of the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) national AI advisory committee and is the former chief AI officer at Microsoft’s business software division.
Velastegui didn’t plan on having a career in AI. She studied mechanical engineering as a Georgia Tech undergrad. But after a job at Apple in 2009, she became fascinated by apps — especially AI-powered ones.
“I started to recognize that AI-infused products resonated with customers, thanks to the feeling of personalization,” Velastegui told TechCrunch. “The possibilities seemed endless for developing AI that could make our lives better at small and large scale, and I wanted to be a part of that revolution. So I started seeking out AI-focused projects and took every opportunity to expand from there.”
Velastegui worked on the first MacBook Air — and first iPad — and soon after was promoted to product manager for all of Apple’s laptops and accessories. A few years later, Velastegui moved into Apple’s special projects group, where she helped to develop CarPlay, iCloud, Apple Maps, and Apple’s data pipeline and AI systems.
In 2015, Velastegui joined Google as head of silicon architecture and director of the company’s Nest-branded product line. After a brief stint at audio tech company Doppler Labs, she accepted a job offer at Microsoft as general manager of AI products and search.
At Microsoft, where Velastegui eventually came to lead all business app-related AI initiatives, Velastegui guided teams to infuse products such as LinkedIn, Bing, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Azure with AI. She also spearheaded internal explorations and projects built with GPT-3, OpenAI’s text-generating model, to which Microsoft had recently acquired the exclusive license.
“My time at Microsoft truly stands out,” Velastegui said. “I joined the company when it was in the midst of huge changes under CEO Satya Nadella’s leadership. Mentors and peers advised me against making that jump in 2017 because they viewed Microsoft as lagging in the industry. But in a short window, Microsoft had started making real headway in AI, and I wanted in.”
Velastegui left Microsoft in 2022 to start a consulting firm and head product development at Aptiv, the automotive tech company. In 2023, she joined the NSF’s AI committee, which collaborates with industry, academia, and government to support basic AI research.
Asked how she navigates the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry, Velastegui credited the women she considers to be her strongest mentors. It’s important that women support each other, Velastegui says — and, perhaps more importantly, that men stand up for their female co-workers.
“For women in tech, if you’ve ever been part of a transformation, adoption, or change management, you have a right to be at the table, so don’t be afraid to take your seat there,” Velastegui said. “Raise your hand to take on more AI responsibilities, whether it’s part of your current job or a stretch project. The best managers will support you and encourage you to keep pushing ahead. But if that’s not feasible in your 9-5, seek out communities or university programs where you can be part of the AI team.”
A lack of diverse viewpoints in the workplace (i.e., AI teams made up mostly of men) can lead to groupthink, Velastegui notes, which is why she advocates that women share feedback as often as they can.
“I strongly encourage more women to get involved in AI so our voices, experiences, and points of view are included at this critical inception point where foundational AI technologies are being defined for now and the future,” she said. “It’s critical that women in every industry really lean into AI. When we join the conversation, we can help shape the industry and change that power imbalance.”
Velastegui says that her work now, with the NSF, focuses on tackling outstanding fundamental issues in AI, like a lack of what she calls “digital representation.” Biases and prejudices pervade today’s AI, she avers, in part due to the homogenous makeup of the companies developing it.
“AI is being trained on data from developers, but developers are mostly men with specific perspectives, and represent a very small subset of the 8 billion people in the world,” she said. “If we’re not including women as developers and if women aren’t providing feedback as users, then AI will not represent them at all.”
Velastegui sees the AI industry’s breakneck pace as a “huge issue” — absent a common ethical safety framework, that is. Such a framework, were it ever to be widely embraced, could allow developers to build systems with speed without stifling innovation, she believes.
But she’s not counting on it.
“We’ve never seen technology this transformative evolve at such a relentless pace,” Velastegui said. “People, regulation, legacy systems … nothing has ever had to keep up at the current speed of AI. The challenge becomes how to stay informed, up-to-date, and forward-thinking, while also aware of the dangers if we move too fast.”
How can a company — or developer — create AI products responsibly today? Velastegui champions a “human-centered” approach with learning from past mistakes and prioritizing the well-being of users at its core.
“Companies should empower a diverse, cross-functional AI council that reviews issues and provides recommendations that reflect the current environment,” Velastegui said, “and create channels for regular feedback and oversight that will adapt as the AI system evolves. And there should be channels for regular feedback and oversight that will adapt as AI systems evolves.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/03/genai-suffers-from-data-overload-so-companies-should-focus-on-smaller-specific-goals/,"GenAI suffers from data overload, so companies should focus on smaller, specific goals | TechCrunch",Paul Sawers,2024-11-03,"“There is no AI without data, there is no AI without unstructured data, and there is no AI without unstructured data at scale,” said Chet Kapoor, chairman and CEO of data management company DataStax.
Kapoor was kicking off a conversation at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 about “new data pipelines” in the context of modern AI applications, where he was joined by Vanessa Larco, partner at VC firm NEA; and George Fraser, CEO of data integration platform Fivetran. While the chat covered multiple bases, such as the importance of data quality and the role of real-time data in generative AI, one of the big takeaways was the importance of prioritizing product-market fit over scale in what really is still the early days of AI. The advice for companies looking to jump into the dizzying world of generative AI is straightforward — don’t be overly ambitious at first, and focus on practical, incremental progress. The reason? We’re really still figuring it all out.
“The most important thing for generative AI is that it all comes down to the people,” Kapoor said. “The SWAT teams that actually go off and build the first few projects — they are not reading a manual; they are writing the manual for how to do generative AI apps.”
While it’s true that data and AI go hand in hand, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by the sheer amount of data a company may have, some of it possibly sensitive and subject to strict protections, and maybe even stored across myriad locations. Larco, who works with (and sits on the board of) numerous startups across the B2C and B2B spectrum, suggested a simple-but-pragmatic approach to unlocking true value in these early days.
“Work backwards for what you’re trying to accomplish — what are you trying to solve for, and what is the data that you need?” Larco said. “Find that data, wherever it resides, and then use it for this purpose.”
This is in contrast to trying to splash generative AI across the whole company from the get-go, throwing all their data at the large language model (LLM) and hoping that it spits out the right thing at the end. That, according to Larco, will likely create an inaccurate, expensive mess. “Start small,” she said. “What we’re seeing is companies starting small, with internal applications, with very specific goals, and then finding the data that matches what they’re trying to accomplish.”
Fraser, who has led “data movement” platform Fivetran since its inception 12 years ago, amassing big-name customers such as OpenAI and Salesforce en route, suggested that companies should focus narrowly on real issues they’re facing in the now.
“Only solve the problems you have today; that’s the mantra,” Fraser said. “The costs in innovation are always 99% in things you built that didn’t work out, not in things that worked out that you wish you had planned for scale ahead of time. Even though those are the problems we always think about in retrospect, those are not the 99% of the cost you bear.”
So much like the early days of the web and, more recently, the smartphone revolution, early applications and use cases for generative AI have shown glimpses of a powerful new AI-enabled future. But so far, they haven’t necessarily been game-changing.
“I call this the Angry Birds era of generative AI,” Kapoor said. “It’s not completely changing my life, no one’s doing my laundry yet. This year, every enterprise that I work with is putting something into production — small, internal, but putting it into production because they’re actually working out the kinks, on how to form the teams to go and make this happen. Next year is what I call the year of transformation, when people will start doing apps that actually start changing the trajectory of the company that they work for.”"

This week, we’re coming at you right off the heels of TechCrunch Disrupt! If you missed it, we’re highlighting conversations from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg, and Disney star turned space CEO Bridgit Mendler. Of course, we’ve got news from the rest of the tech world as well. Let’s do it.
Why did Wiz turn down $23 billion? Wiz co-founder and CEO ​​Assaf Rappaport said at TechCrunch Disrupt that turning down Alphabet’s offer was “the toughest decision ever,” but they did so because they believed the cloud security space is a $100 billion opportunity for the company. At the time Wiz turned down the offer, the startup had a private valuation of $12 billion. The CEO admitted that they also had other offers, though none as big as Google’s.
Apple had a big week of reveals, including the latest additions to the M-series of chips. The company unveiled the new M4 Pro, which debuts alongside the tiny new Mac mini and the M4 Max, the latter of which is coming to the MacBook Pro line as an upgradeable option. Apple also gave a refresh to its desktop accessories, switching them from Lightning to USB-C. But the charging port for the Magic Mouse is still awkwardly on the bottom.
Dropbox is laying off 20% of its workforce. In a letter to staff, CEO Drew Houston said the cloud company is undergoing a “transitional period” and that the goal was to make cuts in areas where Dropbox has “over-invested” while designing a “flatter, more efficient” team structure. The reduction in headcount will affect 528 employees.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/02/quantum-machines-and-nvidia-use-machine-learning-to-get-closer-to-an-error-corrected-quantum-computer/,Quantum Machines and Nvidia use machine learning to get closer to an error-corrected quantum computer | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-11-02,"About a year and a half ago, quantum control startup Quantum Machines and Nvidia announced a deep partnership that would bring together Nvidia’s DGX Quantum computing platform and Quantum Machine’s advanced quantum control hardware. We didn’t hear much about the results of this partnership for a while, but it’s now starting to bear fruit and getting the industry one step closer to the holy grail of an error-corrected quantum computer.
In a presentation earlier this year, the two companies showed that they are able to use an off-the-shelf reinforcement learning model running on Nvidia’s DGX platform to better control the qubits in a Rigetti quantum chip by keeping the system calibrated.
Yonatan Cohen, the co-founder and CTO of Quantum Machines, noted how his company has long sought to use general classical compute engines to control quantum processors. Those compute engines were small and limited, but that’s not a problem with Nvidia’s extremely powerful DGX platform. The holy grail, he said, is to run quantum error correction. We’re not there yet. Instead, this collaboration focused on calibration, and specifically calibrating the “π pulses” that control the rotation of a qubit inside a quantum processor.
At first glance, calibration may seem like a one-shot problem: You calibrate the processor before you start running the algorithm on it. But it’s not that simple. “If you look at the performance of quantum computers today, you get some high fidelity,” Cohen said. “But then, the users, when they use the computer, it’s typically not at the best fidelity. It drifts all the time. If we can frequently recalibrate it using these kinds of techniques and underlying hardware, then we can improve the performance and keep the fidelity [high] over a long time, which is what’s going to be needed in quantum error correction.”
Constantly adjusting those pulses in near real time is an extremely compute-intensive task, but since a quantum system is always slightly different, it is also a control problem that lends itself to being solved with the help of reinforcement learning.
“As quantum computers are scaling up and improving, there are all these problems that become bottlenecks, that become really compute-intensive,” said Sam Stanwyck, Nvidia’s group product manager for quantum computing. “Quantum error correction is really a huge one. This is necessary to unlock fault-tolerant quantum computing, but also how to apply exactly the right control pulses to get the most out of the qubits.”
Stanwyck also stressed that there was no system before DGX Quantum that would enable the kind of minimal latency necessary to perform these calculations.
As it turns out, even a small improvement in calibration can lead to massive improvements in error correction. “The return on investment in calibration in the context of quantum error correction is exponential,” explained Quantum Machines product manager Ramon Szmuk. “If you calibrate 10% better, that gives you an exponentially better logical error [performance] in the logical qubit that is composed of many physical qubits. So there’s a lot of motivation here to calibrate very well and fast.”
It’s worth stressing that this is just the start of this optimization process and collaboration. What the team actually did here was simply take a handful of off-the-shelf algorithms and look at which one worked best (TD3, in this case). All in all, the actual code for running the experiment was only about 150 lines long. Of course, this relies on all of the work the two teams also did to integrate the various systems and build out the software stack. For developers, though, all of that complexity can be hidden away, and the two companies expect to create more and more open source libraries over time to take advantage of this larger platform.
Szmuk stressed that for this project, the team only worked with a very basic quantum circuit but that it can be generalized to deep circuits as well. “If you can do this with one gate and one qubit, you can also do it with a hundred qubits and 1,000 gates,” he said.
“I’d say the individual result is a small step, but it’s a small step towards solving the most important problems,” Stanwyck added. “Useful quantum computing is going to require the tight integration of accelerated supercomputing — and that may be the most difficult engineering challenge. So being able to do this for real on a quantum computer and tune up a pulse in a way that is not just optimized for a small quantum computer but is a scalable, modular platform, we think we’re really on the way to solving some of the most important problems in quantum computing with this.”
Stanwyck also said that the two companies plan to continue this collaboration and get these tools into the hands of more researchers. With Nvidia’s Blackwell chips becoming available next year, they’ll also have an even more powerful computing platform for this project, too."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/02/mit-debuts-a-large-language-model-inspired-method-for-teaching-robots-new-skills/,MIT debuts a large language model-inspired method for teaching robots new skills | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-02,"MIT this week showcased a new model for training robots. Rather than the standard set of focused data used to teach robots new tasks, the method goes big, mimicking the massive troves of information used to train large language models (LLMs).
The researchers note that imitation learning — in which the agent learns by following an individual performing a task — can fail when small challenges are introduced. These could be things like lighting, a different setting, or new obstacles. In those scenarios, the robots simply don’t have enough data to draw upon in order to adapt.
The team looked to models like GPT-4 for a kind of brute force data approach to problem-solving.
“In the language domain, the data are all just sentences,” says Lirui Wang, the new paper’s lead author. “In robotics, given all the heterogeneity in the data, if you want to pretrain in a similar manner, we need a different architecture.”
The team introduced a new architecture called heterogeneous pretrained transformers (HPT), which pulls together information from different sensors and different environments. A transformer was then used to pull together the data into training models. The larger the transformer, the better the output.
Users then input the robot design, configuration, and the job they want done.
“Our dream is to have a universal robot brain that you could download and use for your robot without any training at all,” CMU associate professor David Held said of the research. “While we are just in the early stages, we are going to keep pushing hard and hope scaling leads to a breakthrough in robotic policies, like it did with large language models.”
The research was founded, in part, by Toyota Research Institute (TRI). Last year at TechCrunch Disrupt, TRI debuted a method for training robots overnight. More recently, it struck a watershed partnership that will unite its robot learning research with Boston Dynamics’ hardware."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/02/can-you-build-a-startup-without-sacrificing-your-mental-health-bonobos-founder-andy-dunn-thinks-so/,Can you build a startup without sacrificing your mental health? Bonobos founder Andy Dunn thinks so | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-11-02,"Bonobos founder Andy Dunn is back in the builder’s seat, working on an in-person social media platform called Pie. But the biggest lessons he learned from his $310 million Bonobos exit don’t have as much to do with entrepreneurship as they do with staying sane.
When Dunn was in college, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but he didn’t get adequate treatment until 2016, when he was hospitalized during a manic episode for the second time.
“The manic state is just a disaster — that’s like being in psychosis, you know, messianic delusions. … You can’t accomplish anything in that state,” Dunn said onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. The incident was enough of a wakeup call that 16 years after his initial diagnosis, he finally took his condition seriously and started going to therapy, taking medication, and monitoring his sleep.
Dunn wrote a book called “Burn Rate: Launching a Startup and Losing My Mind,” documenting the parallel processes of building Bonobos and figuring out how to accept and then manage his bipolar disorder. But the lessons from the book are applicable for entrepreneurs beyond those with Dunn’s diagnosis.
“We all have mental health, right? It doesn’t take a diagnosis to suffer or struggle,” he said.
Still, entrepreneurs tend to report a higher incidence of mental health issues throughout their lives than the average person.
“There’s definitely a correlation between neurodivergence and creativity,” he said. “I don’t know if entrepreneurship attracts people who are neurodivergent, or it makes them more neurodivergent, but there’s certainly some kind of a virtuous and sometimes unvirtuous cycle there.”
That interplay between mental illness and entrepreneurship is even more palpable for Dunn, who says that the state of hypomania — the high of bipolar disorder, as opposed to the crushing depressive periods — could be conducive to running a startup.
“Here are the DSM criteria for [hypomania]: rapid speech, increased ideation, grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, ability to be more creative … more or less the central casting traits of an entrepreneur having a good day,” he said. “I was able to benefit from that, but the price that I paid was ultimately too high. I was depressed with suicidal ideation for between two to three months a year, and then ultimately, the full mania and psychosis came raging back, which was catastrophic.”
But even in an astonishingly productive hypomanic state, Dunn doesn’t think he was the greatest boss or colleague. He said that one of the side effects of hypomania is becoming irritable when people disagree with you, which is essential to running a collaborative company. Now, running Pie, Dunn welcomes this debate.
“When we disagree, let’s go, let’s disagree even more, because we’re going to be able to make a better decision coming out of it,” he said.
While discussions about mental health have become more mainstream, founders still worry about the stigma of revealing a diagnosis to colleagues and investors. Dunn is an adviser to the Founder Mental Health Pledge, which asks investors to advocate for the mental health of the founders they invest in. But he’s not naive that the stigma is still present — when founders ask for his advice about when to disclose a mental health concern to investors, he says to wait six weeks until after the deal closes.
“We raised $125 million at Bonobos — would you give $125 million to someone who can either be psychotic or catatonically depressed?” Dunn said. “But also, you shouldn’t do what I did and hide it, because then, you know, when there is a crisis, it’s a surprise.”
Dunn’s discussion of his experience with bipolar disorder doesn’t seem to have hurt his ability to fundraise, though — Pie just raised a $11.5 million Series A. As public as he is about the severity of bipolar disorder, he’s also open about how his regimen of therapy and medication have helped him live a stable life.
“I treat bipolar as my Olympic regimen. For Simone Biles, it’s how to navigate and win the gold,” he said. “For me, the gold medal is to die of something else, right? Because the horrible thing about bipolar is the suicide rate.”
Now, the next test for Dunn is to do the work it takes to make Pie a success without sacrificing his stability.
“Here’s the challenge,” Dunn said. “We want to have good mental health, and we want our teams to have balance in mental health, and yet a 40-hour workweek doesn’t cut it. You can’t change the world with a bunch of people working 40 hours a week.”
One way Dunn has navigated this fine line is to be open with job candidates about what the work will entail, as well as how he will support them with company benefits.
“I have a new spiel I give when recruiting, which is, this is a 50- to 60-hour-per-week job, and in return, you’re going to get two awesome things. One, you’re going to learn more and grow more and develop more. Two, you’ve got equity,” he said.
Like any startup leader, Dunn wants his team to work hard, but he believes there’s a way to do that without it backfiring. In describing his time at Bonobos in “Burn Rate,” Dunn writes, “I came to a classic mistaken conclusion of an immature startup founder: if the business isn’t working, then we must not be working hard enough.”
There’s no denying that founders need to work hard — but taking care of oneself is part of that hard work."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/02/coffeespace-is-a-hinge-like-app-that-wants-to-help-you-find-your-co-founder/,CoffeeSpace is a Hinge-like app that wants to help you find your co-founder | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-11-02,"CoffeeSpace is on a mission to help people find partners for their startup ideas online. The startup, which exhibited as part of the Startup Battlefield 200 at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, has launched a social networking app that matches people exploring startup ideas and looking for co-founders.
The startup’s algorithm only matches candidates who meet each other’s requirements. You can filter through potential candidates based on several different filters, including expertise, location, industry, and more.
CoffeeSpace CEO Hazim Mohamad told TechCrunch he believes that when you look for a co-founder for your business idea, you want to go beyond a traditional résumé, which is why the app gives users a peek into others’ personalities and working styles in order to help people get an idea of whether a match would be an ideal candidate.
“We’re helping people realize their dreams of exploring their startup ideas,” Mohamed said. “We believe CoffeeSpace will change the nature of how people can find business partners, just like what Tinder did for online dating 10 years ago.”
The social network launched in March and currently has more than 7,000 users. Since its launch, CoffeeSpace has seen over 270,000 swipes on the app.
In terms of the app’s UI, the startup has taken inspiration from Hinge. When you sign up for the platform, your CoffeeSpace profile will include a mix of public and private data. The public data comes from your LinkedIn profile, while you enter the private data yourself.
The private data includes information about your location and what sort of co-founder you’re looking for. For example, you can note that you’re looking for someone with a product design background.
The platform operates on a freemium model, as users can access the app and get 10 matches for free. If you want to unlock more matches, you can subscribe to the service’s premium offering, which costs $50 per month. The premium subscription also unlocks additional filters that you can use to narrow down your search even further.
CoffeeSpace is available on iOS and Android."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/02/careyaya-is-enabling-affordable-home-care-by-connecting-healthcare-students-with-elders/,CareYaya is enabling affordable home care by connecting healthcare students with elders | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-11-02,"CareYaya, a platform that matches people who need caregivers with healthcare students, is working to disrupt the caregiving industry. The startup, which exhibited as part of the Battlefield 200 at TechCrunch Disrupt, is looking to enhance affordable in-home support, while also helping students prepare for their future healthcare careers.
The startup was founded in 2022 by Neal Shah, who came up with the idea for the startup based on his own experience as a caregiver for his wife after she became ill with cancer and various other ailments. During this time, Shah was a partner at a hedge fund and had to wind down his fund to become a full-time caregiver for two years.
To get additional care for his wife, Shah hired college students who were studying healthcare to be caregivers for his wife. Shah learned that other families were doing the same thing informally by posting flyers at local campuses to find someone who was qualified to look after their loved one.
“I was like, wouldn’t it be nice to just build a formal system for them to do it, where you don’t have to go to your local nursing school or your local undergrad campus and post flyers,” Shah told TechCrunch. “This is what I was doing. So we were like, if you can bring that into a formal capacity through a tech platform, you can make a big impact.”
Fast-forward to 2024, and the platform now has over 25,000 students on its platform from numerous schools, including Duke University, Stanford, UC Berkeley, San Jose State, University of Texas at Austin, and more.
CareYaya performs background checks on students who want to join the platform and then completes video-based interviews with them. On the user side, people can join the platform and then detail the type of care their loved one needs. CareYaya then matches students to families, whether it’s for one-off sessions or continuous care. After the first session, both parties can leave ratings.
The startup says it can help families save thousands of dollars on recurring senior care. While at-home care costs an average of $35 per hour in the U.S., CareYaya charges between $17 and $20 per hour.
Since the students providing the care are tech savvy, CareYaya is equipping them with AI-powered technology to recognize and track disease progression in patients with Alzheimer’s and dementia. The company recently launched an LLM (large language model) that integrates with smart glasses to gather visual data to help students provide better real-time assistance and conduct early dementia screening.
In terms of the future, CareYaya wants to explore expanding beyond the United States, as the platform has seen interest from people in places like Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/02/how-national-interest-startups-should-be-thinking-about-government-contracts/,How national interest startups should be thinking about government contracts | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-11-02,"National interest technology can show up in a lot of ways, like in data analysis and cybersecurity, as well as satellites and weapons. Many startups with dual-use applications are increasingly looking at the government as an attractive customer due to its wide range of use cases and the amount of federal dollars available.
And while there are several grant programs (like those offered via the Inflation Reduction Act) that provide nondilutive funding for startups, Rebecca Gevalt, managing partner at Dcode Capital who used to work at the CIA, says she advises companies to go after contracts instead.
“The real key is, how do you figure out a repeatable way to get government revenue so that it can be a core part of your business?” Gevalt said onstage this week at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024.
Gevalt spoke alongside Topher Haddad, founder and CEO of satellite imagery startup Albedo, and Kai Kloepfer, founder and CEO of biometric weapons startup Biofire, about the boom in national interest startups and how startups can go about getting a foot in the government door.
The goal for startups working with the government should be to get repeatable revenue, not just grant money or other nondilutive funding. One easy target for startups with a national interest use case? The Department of Defense (DOD), which Gevalt says is “flush with money.”
The DOD’s budget request for 2025 was close to $850 billion, with $143.2 billion for research, development, testing, and evaluation and then another $167.5 billion set aside for procurement. The agency is actively looking to work with startups developing AI, autonomous systems, quantum computing, and space technologies.
There are a number of entry points for startups, such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs through DARPA. And while startups can get a foot in the door through those programs, Gevalt recommends that startups have a partner to guide them from concept and prototyping phases through to commercial contracts.
“There are strategies to go from that first in the door, R&D dollars for development into more programmatic revenue, and that’s where our advisory firm helps companies, but there’s a number of them in DC that help companies do that,” she said.
And Gevalt has a point. A 2023 Defense Innovation Board report found that only 16% of DOD SBIR-funded companies made it to commercialization contracts over the last 10 years.
“I think a lot of times people can fall into the trap of thinking, if I want to sell to the government, then it has to be related to defense tech, and I have to be involved in drones, missiles, things like that. And that’s fundamentally not the case,” Gevalt said.
She says Dcode is heavily focused on investing in startups that handle and analyze data, as well as ones that offer cybersecurity solutions.
“By law, the government cannot delete any of its data, so it’s going to be a continually growing problem for them to manage it and to drive insights out of it,” Gevalt said. “And then, from a cybersecurity perspective, they get hacked rather frequently, so trying to get them access to the best tools.”
In the lead-up to the U.S. election, should startups be coming up with contingency plans for different presidential candidates? Gevalt and Albedo’s Haddad say that’s not exactly necessary.
“Across administrations, you are going to have people interested in data, tools, cybersecurity, the latest in AI,” Gevalt said. “Where the dollars flow change, how big the government will be could change. But I fundamentally believe whether or not the government grows or gets smaller, there’s going to be a requirement for them to upgrade their systems from the year 2000.”
Haddad noted that Albedo is in “wait-and-see” mode, as it’s expecting some effects. But not enough to have a Plan A and Plan B for different candidates.
“Generally, space is a big priority, and I don’t think that will change,” Haddad said. “Maybe it will change a bit of the business development in terms of how we focus on different agencies or departments.”
Gevalt said that the best way to remain unaffected by changing administrations is to seek out relationships with nonpolitical appointments.
“As you’re developing your federal go-to-market motion, you don’t typically want to talk to the politicals,” she said. “You want to talk to the people who are doing the jobs day in, day out, regardless of who’s in the administration, because those are the people who are going to buy your products.”
Gevalt said that for government, contracting with startups that are based in and producing products in the U.S. is preferred — but more so for software than hardware.
“If there are certain people on your team doing certain work from certain countries, then it makes it very hard to do sales into the government, at least into the DOD and into some intelligence community agencies,” she said.
Both Albedo and Biofire are based in the U.S., with manufacturing facilities in Colorado. Kloepfer noted that building in the U.S. was important for Biofire because of the nature of its business.
“We are quite strongly regulated by the Department of Commerce with respect to export controls. … [T]he U.S. is excited about keeping its weapons technology inside the U.S.,” he said, noting that Biofire would likely need special approval to contract foreign manufacturers.
He added that investors also like to see onshored manufacturing because it helps with quality control and scaling.
“For the early stage that we’re at, it’s how fast can we iterate? How fast can we improve?” Kloepfer said. “And doing that at our current headquarters facility … is orders of magnitude easier than iterating with some sort of overseas vendor, if that’s even possible.”
Gevalt says that her firm often sees early-stage companies hire a salesperson or lobbyist out the gate when trying to secure contracts with the federal government. She advises instead that startups first figure out which agencies have a need for their technology using available data from sites like Bloomberg Government (BGov), GovTribe, and GovWin IQ.
“When the government says they want to go buy something, they have to put it out publicly, unless it’s a classified thing,” she said. “So … you can sift through that data. And if you know whoever your competitor is, and you know they’re selling to the government, you can … see what contracts have they won? In what offices have they won them? Are they working with partners like Deloitte or Booz Allen?”
That’s also true for AI startups looking to work with government.
The key mindset is to be strategic and tactical, Gevalt says, noting that startups should look at the government’s overarching strategy documents regarding AI and then tactically seek out offices that are actively leveraging AI technologies.
“You have a lot of people who’ve been in the government for a very long time, and so they know conceptually what AI is, but a lot of the data architecture that they have won’t actually facilitate the use of an AI product on whatever datasets they’re working on anyway,” Gevalt said. “So … strategically, you can see the Biden administration right now wants to leverage AI in this way. But tactically, how are the agencies actually doing it? … How are they buying it? Are they buying it through a partner?”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/what-can-we-do-about-the-spread-of-ai-generated-disinformation/,What can we do about the spread of AI-generated disinformation? | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-01,"Disinformation is spreading at an alarming pace, thanks largely to openly available AI tools. In a recent survey, 85% of people said that they worry about online disinformation, and the World Economic Forum has named disinformation from AI as a top global risk.
Some high-profile examples of disinformation campaigns this year include a bot network on X targeting U.S. federal elections, and a voicemail deepfake of president Joe Biden discouraging certain residents from voting. Overseas, candidates in countries across South Asia have flooded the web with fake videos, images, and news articles. A deepfake of London mayor Sadiq Khan even incited violence at a pro-Palestinian march.
So what can be done?
Well, AI can help combat disinformation as well as create it, asserts Pamela San Martín, co-chair of Meta’s Oversight Board. Established in 2020, the Board is a semi-autonomous organization that reviews complaints of Meta’s moderation policies and issues recommendations on its content policies.
San Martín acknowledges that AI isn’t perfect. For instance, Meta’s AI product has mistakenly flagged Auschwitz Museum posts as offensive, and misclassified independent news sites as spam. But she is convinced that it’ll improve with time.
“Most social media content is moderated by automation, and automation uses AI either to flag certain content for it to be reviewed by humans, or to flag certain content for it to be ‘actioned’ — putting a warning screen up, removing it, down-ranking it in the algorithms, etc.,” San Martín said last week during a panel on AI disinformation at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. “It’s expected for [AI moderation models] to get better, and if they do get better, they can become very useful for addressing [disinformation].”
Of course, with the cost of sowing disinformation declining thanks to AI, it’s possible that even upgraded moderation models won’t be able to keep up.
Another participant on the panel, Imran Ahmed, CEO of the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, also noted that social feeds amplifying disinformation exacerbate its harms. Platforms such as X effectively incentivize disinformation through revenue-sharing programs — the BBC reports that X is paying users thousands of dollars for well-performing posts that include conspiracy theories and AI-generated images.
“You’ve got a perpetual bulls— machine,” Ahmed said. “That’s quite worrying. I’m not sure that we should be creating that within democracies that rely upon some degree of truth.”
San Martín argued that the Oversight Board has effected some change here, for example by encouraging Meta to label misleading AI-generated content. The Oversight Board has also suggested Meta make it easier to identify cases of nonconsensual sexual deepfake imagery, a growing problem.
But both Ahmed and panelist Brandie Nonnecke, a UC Berkeley professor who studies the intersection of emerging tech and human rights, pushed back against the notion that the Oversight Board and self-governance in a general sense can alone stem the tide of disinformation.
“Fundamentally, self-regulation is not regulation, because the Oversight Board itself cannot answer the five fundamental questions you should always ask someone who has power,” Ahmed said. “What power do you have, who gave you that power, in whose interest do you wield that power, to whom are you accountable, and how do we get rid of you if you’re not doing a good job. If the answer to every single one of those questions is [Meta], then you’re not any sort of check or balance. You’re merely a bit of PR spin.”
Ahmed’s and Nonnecke’s isn’t a fringe opinion. In an analysis in June, NYU’s Brennan Center wrote that the Oversight Board is confined to influencing only a fraction of Meta’s decisions because the company controls whether to enact policy changes and doesn’t provide access to its algorithms.
Meta has also privately threatened to pull back support for the Oversight Board, highlighting the precarious nature of the board’s operations. While the Oversight Board is funded by an irrevocable trust, Meta is the sole contributor to that trust.
Instead of self-governance — which platforms like X are unlikely to adopt in the first place — Ahmed and Nonnecke see regulation as the solution to the disinformation dilemma. Nonnecke believes that product liability tort is one way to take platforms to task, as the doctrine holds companies accountable for injuries or damages caused by their “defective” products.
Nonnecke was also supportive of the idea of watermarked AI content so that it’s easier to tell which content has been AI-generated. (Watermarking has its own challenges, of course.) She suggested payment providers could block purchases of disinformation of a sexual nature and that website hosts could make it tougher for bad actors to sign up for plans.
Policymakers trying to bring industry to bear have suffered setbacks in the U.S. recently. In October, a federal judge blocked a California law that would’ve forced posters of AI deepfakes to take them down or potentially face monetary penalties.
But Ahmed believes there’s reason for optimism. He cited recent moves by AI companies like OpenAI to watermark their AI-generated images and to have content moderation laws like the Online Safety Act in the U.K.
“It is inevitable there will have to be regulation for something that potentially has such damage to our democracies — to our health, to our societies, to us as individuals,” Ahmed said. “I think there’s enormous amounts of reason for hope.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/microsoft-and-a16z-set-aside-differences-join-hands-in-plea-against-ai-regulation/,"Microsoft and a16z set aside differences, join hands in plea against AI regulation | TechCrunch",Devin Coldewey,2024-11-01,"Two of the biggest forces in two deeply intertwined tech ecosystems — large incumbents and startups — have taken a break from counting their money to jointly plead that the government desist from even pondering regulations that might affect their financial interests, or as they prefer to call them, innovation.
“Our two companies might not agree on everything, but this is not about our differences,” writes this group of vastly disparate perspectives and interests: Founding a16z partners Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and President/Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith. A truly intersectional assemblage, representing both big business and big money.
But it’s the little guys they’re supposedly looking out for. That is, all the companies that would have been affected by the latest attempt at regulatory overreach: SB 1047.
Imagine being jailed for improper open model disclosure! a16z general partner Anjney Midha called it a “regressive tax” on startups and “blatant regulatory capture” by the Big Tech companies that alone could, unlike Midha and his impoverished colleagues, afford the lawyers necessary to comply.
Except that was all disinformation promulgated by Andreessen Horowitz and the other moneyed interests that might actually have been affected, as backers of billion-dollar enterprises. In fact, small models and startups would have been only trivially affected because the proposed law specifically protected them.
It’s odd that the very type of purposeful cutout for “Little Tech” that Horowitz and Andreessen routinely champion was distorted and minimized by the lobbying campaign they and others ran against SB 1047. (The architect of the bill, California State Senator Scott Wiener, talked about this whole thing recently at Disrupt.)
That bill had its problems, but its (admittedly wide-ranging) opposition vastly overstated the cost of compliance and failed to meaningfully support claims that it would chill or burden startups.
It’s part of the established playbook that Big Tech — which Andreessen and Horowitz are closely aligned with, despite their posturing — fights at the state level where it can win (as with SB 1047), meanwhile asking for federal solutions that it knows will never materialize, or which will have no teeth due to partisan bickering and congressional ineptitude on technical matters.
This newly posted joint statement about “policy opportunity” belongs to the latter part of the play: After torpedoing SB 1047, they can say they only did so with an eye to supporting a federal policy. No matter that we are still waiting on the federal privacy law that tech companies have pushed for a decade while fighting state bills.
And what policies do they support? “A variety of responsible market-based approaches.” In other words: hands off our money, Uncle Sam.
Regulations should have “a science and standards-based approach that recognizes regulatory frameworks that focus on the application and misuse of technology,” and should “focus on the risk of bad actors misusing AI,” write the powerful VCs and Microsoft execs. What is meant by this is we shouldn’t have proactive regulation but instead reactive punishments when unregulated products are used by criminals for criminal purposes.
This approach worked great for that whole FTX situation, so I can see why they espouse it.
“Regulation should be implemented only if its benefits outweigh its costs,” they also write. It would take thousands of words to unpack all the ways that this idea, expressed in this context, is hilarious. But basically, what they are suggesting is that the fox be brought in on the henhouse planning committee.
Regulators should “permit developers and startups the flexibility to choose which AI models to use wherever they are building solutions and not tilt the playing field to advantage any one platform,” they collectively add. The implication is that there is some sort of plan to require permission to use one model or another. Since that’s not the case, this is a straw man.
Here’s a big one that I have to just quote in its entirety:
The right to learn: copyright law is designed to promote the progress of science and useful arts by extending protections to publishers and authors to encourage them to bring new works and knowledge to the public, but not at the expense of the public’s right to learn from these works. Copyright law should not be co-opted to imply that machines should be prevented from using data — the foundation of AI — to learn in the same way as people. Knowledge and unprotected facts, regardless of whether contained in protected subject matter, should remain free and accessible.
To be clear, the explicit assertion here is that software, run by billion-dollar corporations, has the “right” to access any data because it should be able to learn from it “in the same way as people.”
First off, no. These systems are not like people; they produce data that mimics human output in their training data. They are complex statistical projection software with a natural language interface. They have no more “right” to any document or fact than Excel.
Second, this idea that “facts” — by which they mean “intellectual property” — are the only thing these systems are interested in and that some kind of fact-hoarding cabal is working to prevent them is an engineered narrative we have seen before. Perplexity has invoked the “facts belong to everyone” argument in its public response to being sued for alleged systematic content theft, and its CEO Aravind Srinivas repeated the fallacy to me onstage at Disrupt, as if Perplexity is being sued over trivia like the distance from the Earth to the Moon.
While this is not the place to embark on a full accounting of this particular straw man argument, let me simply point out that while facts are indeed free agents, the way they are created — say, through original reporting and scientific research — involves real costs. That is why the copyright and patent systems exist: not to prevent intellectual property from being shared and used widely, but to incentivize its creation by ensuring that they can be assigned real value.
Copyright law is far from perfect and is probably abused as much as it is used. But it is not being “co-opted to imply that machines should be prevented from using data.” It is being applied to ensure that bad actors do not circumvent the systems of value that we have built around intellectual property.
That is quite clearly the ask: let the systems the authors own and run and profit from freely use the valuable output of others without compensation. To be fair, that part is “in the same way as humans,” because it is humans who design, direct, and deploy these systems, and those humans don’t want to pay for anything they don’t have to, and don’t want regulations to change that.
There are plenty of other recommendations in this little policy document, which are no doubt given greater detail in the versions they’ve sent directly to lawmakers and regulators through official lobbying channels.
Some ideas are undoubtedly good, if also a little self-serving: “fund digital literacy programs that help people understand how to use AI tools to create and access information.” Good! Of course, the authors are heavily invested in those tools. Support “Open Data Commons—pools of accessible data that would be managed in the public’s interest.” Great! “Examine its procurement practices to enable more startups to sell technology to the government.” Awesome!
But these more general, positive recommendations are the kind of thing you see every year from industry: invest in public resources and speed up government processes. These palatable but inconsequential suggestions are just a vehicle for the more important ones that I outlined above.
Ben Horowitz, Brad Smith, Marc Andreessen, and Satya Nadella want the government to back off regulating this lucrative new development, let industry decide which regulations are worth the trade-off, and nullify copyright in a way that more or less acts as a general pardon for illegal or unethical practices that many suspect enabled the rapid rise of AI. Those are the policies that matter to them, whether kids get digital literacy or not."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/spacex-wants-to-test-refueling-starships-in-space-early-next-year/,SpaceX wants to test refueling Starships in space early next year | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-11-01,"SpaceX will attempt to transfer propellant from one orbiting Starship to another as early as next March, a technical milestone that will pave the way for an uncrewed landing demonstration of a Starship on the moon, a NASA official said this week.
Much has been made of Starship’s potential to transform the commercial space industry, but NASA is also hanging its hopes that the vehicle will return humans to the moon under the Artemis program. The space agency awarded the company a $4.05 billion contract for two human-rated Starship vehicles, with the upper stage (also called Starship) landing astronauts on the surface of the moon for the first time since the Apollo era. The crewed landing is currently scheduled for September 2026.
Kent Chojnacki, deputy manager of NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS) program, provided more detail on exactly how the agency is working with the space company as it looks toward that critical mission in an interview with Spaceflight Now. It will come as no surprise that NASA is paying close attention to Starship’s test campaign, which has notched five launches so far.
SpaceX made history during the most recent test on October 13 when it caught the Super Heavy rocket booster mid-air using “chopsticks” attached to the launch tower for the first time.
“We learn a lot each time [a launch] happens,” Chojnacki said.
Chojnacki’s work history includes numerous roles in the Space Launch System (SLS) program, which oversees the development of a massive rocket of the same name that is being built by a handful of traditional aerospace primes. The first SLS rocket launched the Artemis I mission in December 2023, and future rockets will launch the subsequent missions under the Artemis program. No part of the rocket is reusable, however, so NASA is spending upwards of $2 billion on each launch vehicle.
The first contracts for the SLS program were awarded over a decade ago under what’s known as a “cost-plus” model, which means that NASA pays a base amount plus expenses. (This type of contract has been stringently criticized for incentivizing long development timelines and high expenses.) In contrast, HLS contracts are “fixed-price” — so SpaceX receives a one-time $2.99 billion payment provided it meets certain milestones.
Chojnacki said NASA has taken very different approaches to the HLS versus SLS program, even beyond the contracting model.
“SLS was a very traditional NASA program. NASA laid out a very strict set of requirements and dictated propellant inventory, dictated all the things to the various elements. They flowed down. They were cost-plus programs where the aerospace companies would respond, and we would work in a very traditional manner,” he said. “Moving to HLS, we’re doing a lot of moving parts at one time. On SpaceX’s contract right now, for their initial landing, there are 27 system requirements. Twenty-seven, and we kept it as loose as possible.”
Under SpaceX’s contract, they must meet mandatory design reviews, but SpaceX can also propose additional milestones for payment. One requirement that SpaceX requested is the ship-to-ship propellant transfer demonstration. Those tests are set to begin around March 2025, with testing concluding in the summer, Chojnacki said.
“That would be the first time that’s demonstrated on this scale, so that is a big building block. And once you’ve done that, you’ve really cracked open the opportunity to move massive amounts of payload and cargo outside of the Earth’s sphere. If you can have a Starship with propellant aggregation, that’s going to be the next step to doing an uncrewed demonstration.”
In addition to the testing, the next major review of Starship will be the Critical Design Review (CDR) in Summer 2025, which is when NASA certifies that the company met all 27 of those system requirements. Chojnacki said NASA astronauts also meet with SpaceX once a month to provide input on Starship’s interior. The company is building mockups of the crew cabin, including the sleeping quarters and laboratory, at Boca Chica. NASA anticipates getting a design update this month before looking at it during the CDR next year.
That isn’t the only place where NASA has offered its input: It also offered input on some aspects of the rocket design, like the vehicle’s cryogenic components, as well as conducting some testing on the thermal tiles that help keep the cryogenic fuels cold.
If all goes to plan, SpaceX will land astronauts on the moon in September 2026.
“That is definitively the date we’re working towards. We don’t have any known road blocks. We do have some first-time things that have to be demonstrated, and we have a plan in place to go demonstrate those."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/perplexity-launches-an-elections-tracker/,Perplexity launches an elections tracker | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-11-01,"Perplexity, the AI-powered search engine, might hallucinate from time to time. But the company wants to show that it’s trustworthy enough to use for tracking election results.
Today, Perplexity announced a dedicated hub for U.S. general election information. Populated by data from The Associated Press and Democracy Works, the company described it in a blog as “an entry point for understanding key issues.”
“Starting Tuesday, we’ll be offering live updates on elections by leveraging data from The Associated Press so you can stay informed on presidential, senate, and house races at both a state and national level,” Perplexity wrote. “Thank you to Democracy Works for granting us access to your Elections API to help power these experiences.”
Perplexity did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request about whether it is compensating the AP and Democracy Works for that data.
Perplexity’s election hub answers election-related questions like voting requirements and poll times, as well as AI-summarized analyses on ballot measures, candidates, policy stances, and endorsements. Aside from the summaries, the hub is essentially a wrapper around data from The Associated Press and Democracy Works’ API — but it’s notable in that Perplexity’s rivals have shown a reluctance to launch comparable features for fear of AI-generated misinformation.
In its recently released ChatGPT Search experience, OpenAI is directing users who ask about election results to The Associated Press and Reuters. Anthropic’s Claude chatbot won’t answer questions about election results, and neither will Google’s Gemini.
We can only hope that Perplexity’s hub is as accurate as the company purports it to be, given AI’s poor track record in this area.
In a July study, the Center for Democracy and Technology found that, in response to 77 different election-related queries, more than a third of answers generated by AI chatbots including Claude and Gemini included incorrect information. Other research has shown that major chatbots perform even worse when asked questions about elections by people with accessibility challenges and those whose primary language isn’t English.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/when-to-sell-your-company-look-for-these-signals/,When to sell your company? Look for these signals | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-11-01,"Part of the mythology of Silicon Valley is the committed founder driving the company to a blockbuster IPO. In reality, startups are 16 times more likely to get acquired.
It’s not an outcome that’s frequently discussed, either.
“It’s one of these things that a lot of people don’t really talk about. In Silicon Valley, we always talk about IPOs,” said Naveen Rao, VP of AI at Databricks and two-time founder, onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 on Thursday.
That silence can make the arduous process even more challenging for founders. “I’m so glad that this is being talked about as a topic on a panel, as a real path and a real outcome for founders, rather than the hallowed, inside secrets of investment bankers who strike a deal,” said Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan, head of data clean rooms at Snowflake and a two-time founder.
“Acquisitions statistically are more likely than IPOs — arguably more successful in many scenarios than IPOs — and certainly something that founders have to kind of mentally and physically prepare for. It’s an endurance journey,” she said.
Rao and Sivaramakrishnan each built and sold two companies: Rao sold Nervana to Intel for $408 million in 2016 and MosaicML to Databricks for $1.3 billion in 2023. Sivaramakrishnan sold Drawbridge to LinkedIn for around $300 million in 2019 and Samooha to Snowflake for $183 million.
Both founders said they didn’t start their companies with the intention of selling them, but when the right deal with the right company came along, it made sense.
“I personally believe that you should build a company and try to make that into a real entity,” Rao said. “If something comes along the way, great. If you try to set yourself up to sell the company, it’ll always be bent that way, like you’re always for sale. And I think the outcome will never be as good.”
“You hear all these stories about ‘good companies are bought, not sold’ and ‘you should just keep going and have infinite perseverance,’” Dharmesh Thakker, general partner at Battery Ventures, told the audience.
“The reality is, most investors have a few hits that make 100x and they pay the fund. The rest of it, whether you make a 1x or a 0.5x or a 2x, it kind of doesn’t really matter. What we try to do is say, ‘Okay, if things aren’t going to be a 50 or 100x, let’s find them a good home early in the cycle,” he added. “It’s much easier to sell a company when you raise $10 million or $20 million and can still make a win-win situation for the founders and investors and get it done. It’s difficult when you have to raise hundreds of millions and then find out that things aren’t working.”
To determine when it’s time to soldier on and when it’s time to sell, Thakker analyzes the company using a three-point framework.
First, he analyses the product: Is it something customers love and are using? If a company is struggling to gain traction in the market, it might warrant a pivot, or it might be worth cashing out.
Second, he looks at the company’s sales and sales cycle. If the product isn’t moving or if it’s challenging for the sales team to complete deals, that might be a red flag.
Third, Thakker takes a look at the balance sheet. If money and runway is running short, that’s a pretty obvious signal that it might be time to look for a suitor.
“I’ve been fortunate to be an investor in MongoDB and Cloudera, Databricks, Confluent, Gong many others, where every time we had an acquisition offer, we looked at the framework and said, Are these three things true?” If the answer was yes, the Battery team encouraged the startup to remain independent.
On occasion, the founders needed a moment to “refresh” and “revitalize,” he added. “In almost all cases, the eventual outcome was a lot better than selling the company.”
But that’s not always the case. If two of the three items in Thakker’s framework aren’t positive, it’s worth reconsidering. Maybe customers bought the product but aren’t using it. Or maybe it’s a good fit but it’s not selling well. In both cases, the company can keep trying, but it’ll burn a lot of cash in the process. “In those cases, you should be much more open-minded, and the sooner you do it, the better off you are,” Thakker said.
When the time comes to sell, Thakker encourages founders to negotiate a deal that’s equitable not just for founders and investors, but their employees as well. “Let’s do right by employees,” he said. “Often, a big component of the acquisition is a retention package for all the employees. And inevitably, if you do that right, many of those employees come back, start a company, and you fund them the second and the third time. And the second and the third time, there are much better outcomes.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/the-chainsmokers-want-to-bring-a-different-kind-of-value-add-to-b2b-companies/,The Chainsmokers want to bring a different kind of value add to B2B companies | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-11-01,"The potential value a celebrity investor can bring to a consumer company, beyond just writing a check, is obvious: marketing and promotion. But that value is less clear when it comes to backing B2B startups. Alex Pall and Drew Taggart, also known as the Chainsmokers, think their VC fund Mantis VC can bring a value add traditional VCs can’t.
At TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 alongside one of their founders, Dan Lorenc, the co-founder and CEO of cybersecurity startup Chainguard, Pall said that the group initially got into B2B investing because they got tired of feeling like the QVC of startups working with consumer companies that just wanted to work with them for promotion.
The duo became increasingly interested in B2B due to the strong market opportunities in that space despite not having much experience with those types of businesses.
“It felt like a market opportunity to kind of stand out and maybe provide, you know, a different perspective or different type of value back to those types of companies,” Pall said. “Our strategy and the way we model our fund is to kind of be this like Robin to everyone’s Batman, and kind of provide a different level of support and perspective and connectivity that maybe the traditional fund isn’t so focused on.”
Taggart added that they aren’t looking to be the next Sequoia either, because that firm already exists and comes with a certain level of value.
“Our goal at Mantis was to just get into these deals, outwork every other person on the cap table, figure out whatever scrappy way we could add value, and then in the hopes that our founders would turn around and kind of help us build our brand within that community,” Taggart said.
One area where they think they can help companies is through their network. Pall said that the Chainsmokers have played private shows for pretty much every Fortune 500 company. And while they didn’t think of it as building a network for investing at the time, they have since been able to connect their portfolio founders to these companies.
“It worked out really well for us, because these are, you know, some really powerful decision-makers or leaders in their respective spaces,” Pall added.
Lorenc backed up these statements, too. He added that they’ve not only been helpful in making introductions for him to potential customers but they’ve also been helpful on the hiring front, too.
Lorenc’s company once wasn’t sure they were going to land a prospective employee due to a compensation disagreement. But they were able to get this candidate over the line after he received a five-minute Cameo video of Pall on why he should join.
“You don’t want to be Sequoia,” Lorenc said. “There’s already Sequoia. You invested in us at the same time Sequoia did. Sequoia is great. They have an amazing platform, team, amazing network, all of that. But when you have enough of those investors, it starts to overlap, and you kind of get diminishing returns. It’s the same network, and the way I describe you is a completely different one.”
The Chainsmokers hope that these early B2B investments that they’ve made help them get taken more seriously in the space so they can continue to build out that portfolio."

Want it in your inbox every Friday? Sign up here.
Money attracts money, as the saying goes. This week seemed to confirm it, with a couple startups announcing new rounds of funding only months after their previous ones, and familiar names launching new ventures.
Whether it’s about IPOs, lobbying, or launching in public, finding momentum is key to success.
Confetti time: Salva Health won the Startup Battlefield competition at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 with the promise to lower breast cancer mortality thanks to an affordable screening device. The four other finalists out of the initial 200 shortlist were Gecko Materials, Luna, MabLab, and Stitch3D.
Half Zomato: India’s largest food delivery and quick-commerce scale-up Swiggy is looking to go public at a $11.3 billion value, less than half the market cap of its rival Zomato.
Wait and see: Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman declared that she wasn’t surprised that we haven’t seen a resurgence in startup IPOs yet. However, she thinks these will start to return with momentum in 2025.
EU Inc momentum: A petition calling for a new legal form for European startups is gaining momentum, with hopes of fostering Pan-European tech champions, but there are many hurdles to overcome along the way.
Eaten up: Generative AI unicorn ElevenLabs hired the team behind open source read-it-later app Omnivore. The team will now focus on ElevenReader, ElevenLabs’ own reader app.
If the names below sound familiar, it’s because several of these startups raised their previous rounds quite recently.
Chatbots: Sierra, an AI customer service startup co-founded by OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor and longtime Google exec Clay Bavor, is valued at $4.5 billion after raising $175 million.
Threat intelligence: French cybersecurity startup Filigran secured a $35 million Series B round of funding for its threat management suite of products, which includes both open source and enterprise offerings.
More bots: Read AI, whose AI bot summarizes meetings and more, released a Chrome extension and announced it raised $50 million in a Series B funding round, only six months after its $21 million Series A.
Protein cages: Archon Biosciences emerged from stealth and announced it raised $20 million in seed funding. The biotech startup is applying AI to drug development, with a focus on addressing shortcomings of antibody treatments.
Chip demand: GMI Cloud, a U.S.-based startup providing GPU cloud infrastructure, raised a Series A round of funding consisting of $15 million in equity and $67 million in debt financing. The round was led by Headline Asia, with participation from strategic investors based in Asia.
Hot wave: Brightwave, a startup that developed an AI agent for asset managers, raised a $15 million Series A only four months after its seed round.
Wilde bets: Actor and director Olivia Wilde quietly launched a venture firm late last year, according to Bloomberg. Called Proximity Ventures, it is already investing in the consumer and enterprise sectors.
Same thesis, more capital: African venture capital firm Janngo Capital closed its oversubscribed second fund at €73 million (around $78 million) and plans to keep on writing checks ranging from €50,000 to €5 million.
New frontiers: Crosscut’s $100 million sixth fund will invest in “frontier tech,” including energy and power, space and underwater exploration, advanced manufacturing, advanced materials, and security and defense.
Horizon Europe: The European Innovation Council will dedicate €1.4 billion (about $1.5 billion) to European deep tech research and startups next year, a €200 million budget increase in comparison with 2024.
AI is often present in funding stories these days, but aggregate data adds more nuance to the picture. Of the nearly 240 mega-rounds into U.S. startups that Crunchbase tracked so far this year, 87 went to biotech and healthcare, placing this category ahead of pure AI, although crossovers are common — for instance, in AI-enabled drug discovery. Xaira Therapeutics is one example; it raised a $1 billion mega-round earlier this year."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/how-to-make-open-source-software-more-secure/,How to make open source software more secure | TechCrunch,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-11-01,"Earlier this year, a Microsoft developer realized that someone had inserted a backdoor into the code of open source utility XZ Utils, which is used in virtually all Linux operating systems.
The operation had started two years earlier when that someone, a person nicknamed JiaT75, started contributing to the XZ Utils repository on GitHub. A cybersecurity expert called this attack a “nightmare scenario” and “the best executed supply chain attack we’ve seen.”
The attack, which followed other well-known cybersecurity incidents involving open source software like Heartbleed, Shellshock, and Log4j, was another stark reminder that open source software, given how widespread it is, can pose significant security risks.
At TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, Bogomil Balkansky, partner at Sequoia Capital; Aeva Black, the section chief for open source security at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency; and Luis Villa, the co-founder of Tidelift, sat down to discuss the challenges of securing open source software.
“I like to say open source is not free like pizza. It’s free like a puppy. You take it home and don’t feed it, it’s going to eat your furniture, your shoes,” said Black.
Balkansky called open source software the “lifeblood of software,” which makes it “foundational and baked into everything.” The problem, Balkansky added, is that “the business model for open source is still very much work in progress.”
So, who should take care of it and pay to secure it?
Villa and his team at Tidelift propose a model where the company pays open source maintainers to take care of their code and partners to fix vulnerabilities.
CISA, Black explained, is now getting involved, launching initiatives to tell businesses what are the best — and worst — security practices when it comes to deploying open source software. “We’re here to participate as a member of the open source community and work with them,” said Black, who thinks open source software is a public good.
In terms of how to go forward, Balkansky said that “the solution to open source security, at least to some degree, also needs to be open source,” and warned that “there are no silver bullets.”
Villa said that there’s a need for “multiple approaches” and “defense in depth,” which means there’s a need for several layers of security to protect the open source ecosystem.
And Black said that software builders need to know which open source software is in their products. “We need better engagement to enable everybody to do that with less effort and less burden on individual volunteer maintainers and nonprofits,” Black said."

What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.
That growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory. And its latest partnership with Apple for its upcoming generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, has given the company another significant bump in the AI race.
2024 also saw the release of GPT-4o, OpenAI’s new flagship omni model for ChatGPT. GPT-4o is now the default free model, complete with voice capabilities. But after demoing GPT-4o, OpenAI paused one of its voices, Sky, after allegations that it was mimicking Scarlett Johansson’s voice in “Her.”
OpenAI is facing internal drama, including the sizable exit of co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever as the company dissolved its Superalignment team. OpenAI is also facing a lawsuit from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune, for alleged copyright infringement, following a similar suit filed by The New York Times last year.
Here’s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.
In a Reddit AMA, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitted that a lack of compute capacity is one major factor preventing the company from shipping products as often as it’d like, including the vision capabilities for Advanced Voice Mode first teased in May. Altman also indicated that the next major release of DALL-E, OpenAI’s image generator, has no launch timeline, and that Sora, OpenAI’s video-generating tool, has also been held back.
Altman also admitted to using ChatGPT “sometimes” to answer questions throughout the AMA.
OpenAI launched ChatGPT Search, an evolution of the SearchGPT prototype it unveiled this summer. Powered by a fine-tuned version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, ChatGPT Search serves up information and photos from the web along with links to relevant sources, at which point you can ask follow-up questions to refine an ongoing search.
🌐 Introducing ChatGPT search 🌐ChatGPT can now search the web in a much better way than before so you get fast, timely answers with links to relevant web sources.https://t.co/7yilNgqH9T pic.twitter.com/z8mJWS8J9c
OpenAI has rolled out Advanced Voice Mode to ChatGPT’s desktop apps for macOS and Windows. For Mac users, that means that both ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode can coexist with Siri on the same device, leading the way for ChatGPT’s Apple Intelligence integration.
Reuters reports that OpenAI is working with TSMC and Broadcom to build an in-house AI chip, which could arrive as soon as 2026. It appears, at least for now, the company has abandoned plans to establish a network of factories for chip manufacturing and is instead focusing on in-house chip design.
OpenAI announced it’s rolling out a feature that allows users to search through their ChatGPT chat histories on the web. The new feature will let users bring up an old chat to remember something or pick back up a chat right where it was left off.
With the release of iOS 18.1, Apple Intelligence features powered by ChatGPT are now available to users. The ChatGPT features include integrated writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for the redesigned Siri experience.
OpenAI denied reports that it is intending to release an AI model, code-named Orion, by December of this year. An OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch that they “don’t have plans to release a model code-named Orion this year,” but that leaves OpenAI substantial wiggle room.
OpenAI has begun previewing a dedicated Windows app for ChatGPT. The company says the app is an early version and is currently only available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users with a “full experience” set to come later this year.
OpenAI struck a content deal with Hearst, the newspaper and magazine publisher known for the San Francisco Chronicle, Esquire, Cosmopolitan, ELLE, and others. The partnership will allow OpenAI to surface stories from Hearst publications with citations and direct links.
OpenAI introduced a new way to interact with ChatGPT called “Canvas.” The canvas workspace allows for users to generate writing or code, then highlight sections of the work to have the model edit. Canvas is rolling out in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Teams, with a rollout to come to Enterprise and Edu tier users next week.
OpenAI has closed the largest VC round of all time. The startup announced it raised $6.6 billion in a funding round that values OpenAI at $157 billion post-money. Led by previous investor Thrive Capital, the new cash brings OpenAI’s total raised to $17.9 billion, per Crunchbase.
At the first of its 2024 Dev Day events, OpenAI announced a new API tool that will let developers build nearly real-time, speech-to-speech experiences in their apps, with the choice of using six voices provided by OpenAI. These voices are distinct from those offered for ChatGPT, and developers can’t use third party voices, in order to prevent copyright issues.
OpenAI is planning to raise the price of individual ChatGPT subscriptions from $20 per month to $22 per month by the end of the year, according to a report from The New York Times. The report notes that a steeper increase could come over the next five years; by 2029, OpenAI expects it’ll charge $44 per month for ChatGPT Plus.
OpenAI CTO Mira Murati announced that she is leaving the company after more than six years. Hours after the announcement, OpenAI’s chief research officer, Bob McGrew, and a research VP, Barret Zoph, also left the company. CEO Sam Altman revealed the two latest resignations in a post on X, along with leadership transition plans.
After a delay, OpenAI is finally rolling out Advanced Voice Mode to an expanded set of ChatGPT’s paying customers. AVM is also getting a revamped design — the feature is now represented by a blue animated sphere instead of the animated black dots that were presented back in May. OpenAI is highlighting improvements in conversational speed, accents in foreign languages, and five new voices as part of the rollout.
A video from YouTube creator ChromaLock showcased how to modify a TI-84 graphing calculator so that it can connect to the internet and access ChatGPT, touting it as the “ultimate cheating device.” As demonstrated in the video, it’s a pretty complicated process for the average high school student to follow — but it might stoke more concerns from teachers about the ongoing concerns about ChatGPT and cheating in schools.
OpenAI unveiled a preview of OpenAI o1, also known as “Strawberry.” The collection of models are available in ChatGPT and via OpenAI’s API: o1-preview and o1 mini. The company claims that o1 can more effectively reason through math and science and fact-check itself by spending more time considering all parts of a command or question.
Unlike ChatGPT, o1 can’t browse the web or analyze files yet, is rate-limited and expensive compared to other models. OpenAI says it plans to bring o1-mini access to all free users of ChatGPT, but hasn’t set a release date.
An artist and hacker found a way to jailbreak ChatGPT to produce instructions for making powerful explosives, a request that the chatbot normally refuses. An explosives expert who reviewed the chatbot’s output told TechCrunch that the instructions could be used to make a detonatable product and was too sensitive to be released.
OpenAI announced it has surpassed 1 million paid users for its versions of ChatGPT intended for businesses, including ChatGPT Team, ChatGPT Enterprise and its educational offering, ChatGPT Edu. The company said that nearly half of OpenAI’s corporate users are based in the US.
Volkswagen is taking its ChatGPT voice assistant experiment to vehicles in the United States. Its ChatGPT-integrated Plus Speech voice assistant is an AI chatbot based on Cerence’s Chat Pro product and a LLM from OpenAI and will begin rolling out on September 6 with the 2025 Jetta and Jetta GLI models.
As part of the new deal, OpenAI will surface stories from Condé Nast properties like The New Yorker, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Bon Appétit and Wired in ChatGPT and SearchGPT. Condé Nast CEO Roger Lynch implied that the “multi-year” deal will involve payment from OpenAI in some form and a Condé Nast spokesperson told TechCrunch that OpenAI will have permission to train on Condé Nast content.
TechCrunch’s Maxwell Zeff has been playing around with OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode, in what he describes as “the most convincing taste I’ve had of an AI-powered future yet.” Compared to Siri or Alexa, Advanced Voice Mode stands out with faster response times, unique answers and the ability to answer complex questions. But the feature falls short as an effective replacement for virtual assistants.
OpenAI has banned a cluster of ChatGPT accounts linked to an Iranian influence operation that was generating content about the U.S. presidential election. OpenAI identified five website fronts presenting as both progressive and conservative news outlets that used ChatGPT to draft several long-form articles, though it doesn’t seem that it reached much of an audience.
OpenAI has found that GPT-4o, which powers the recently launched alpha of Advanced Voice Mode in ChatGPT, can behave in strange ways. In a new “red teaming” report, OpenAI reveals some of GPT-4o’s weirder quirks, like mimicking the voice of the person speaking to it or randomly shouting in the middle of a conversation.
After a big jump following the release of OpenAI’s new GPT-4o “omni” model, the mobile version of ChatGPT has now seen its biggest month of revenue yet. The app pulled in $28 million in net revenue from the App Store and Google Play in July, according to data provided by app intelligence firm Appfigures.
OpenAI has built a watermarking tool that could potentially catch students who cheat by using ChatGPT — but The Wall Street Journal reports that the company is debating whether to actually release it. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is researching tools that can detect writing from ChatGPT, but said it’s taking a “deliberate approach” to releasing it.
OpenAI is giving users their first access to GPT-4o’s updated realistic audio responses. The alpha version is now available to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users, and the company says the feature will gradually roll out to all Plus users in the fall of 2024. The release follows controversy surrounding the voice’s similarity to Scarlett Johansson, leading OpenAI to delay its release.
OpenAI is testing SearchGPT, a new AI search experience to compete with Google. SearchGPT aims to elevate search queries with “timely answers” from across the internet, as well as the ability to ask follow-up questions. The temporary prototype is currently only available to a small group of users and its publisher partners, like The Atlantic, for testing and feedback.
A new report from The Information, based on undisclosed financial information, claims OpenAI could lose up to $5 billion due to how costly the business is to operate. The report also says the company could spend as much as $7 billion in 2024 to train and operate ChatGPT.
OpenAI released its latest small AI model, GPT-4o mini. The company says GPT-4o mini, which is cheaper and faster than OpenAI’s current AI models, outperforms industry leading small AI models on reasoning tasks involving text and vision. GPT-4o mini will replace GPT-3.5 Turbo as the smallest model OpenAI offers.
OpenAI announced a partnership with the Los Alamos National Laboratory to study how AI can be employed by scientists in order to advance research in healthcare and bioscience. This follows other health-related research collaborations at OpenAI, including Moderna and Color Health.
OpenAI announced it has trained a model off of GPT-4, dubbed CriticGPT, which aims to find errors in ChatGPT’s code output so they can make improvements and better help so-called human “AI trainers” rate the quality and accuracy of ChatGPT responses.
OpenAI and TIME announced a multi-year strategic partnership that brings the magazine’s content, both modern and archival, to ChatGPT. As part of the deal, TIME will also gain access to OpenAI’s technology in order to develop new audience-based products.
OpenAI planned to start rolling out its advanced Voice Mode feature to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users in late June, but it says lingering issues forced it to postpone the launch to July. OpenAI says Advanced Voice Mode might not launch for all ChatGPT Plus customers until the fall, depending on whether it meets certain internal safety and reliability checks.
ChatGPT for macOS is now available for all users. With the app, users can quickly call up ChatGPT by using the keyboard combination of Option + Space. The app allows users to upload files and other photos, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations.
Apple announced at WWDC 2024 that it is bringing ChatGPT to Siri and other first-party apps and capabilities across its operating systems. The ChatGPT integrations, powered by GPT-4o, will arrive on iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia later this year, and will be free without the need to create a ChatGPT or OpenAI account. Features exclusive to paying ChatGPT users will also be available through Apple devices.
Scarlett Johansson has been invited to testify about the controversy surrounding OpenAI’s Sky voice at a hearing for the House Oversight Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation. In a letter, Rep. Nancy Mace said Johansson’s testimony could “provide a platform” for concerns around deepfakes.
ChatGPT was down twice in one day: one multi-hour outage in the early hours of the morning Tuesday and another outage later in the day that is still ongoing. Anthropic’s Claude and Perplexity also experienced some issues.
The Atlantic and Vox Media have announced licensing and product partnerships with OpenAI. Both agreements allow OpenAI to use the publishers’ current content to generate responses in ChatGPT, which will feature citations to relevant articles. Vox Media says it will use OpenAI’s technology to build “audience-facing and internal applications,” while The Atlantic will build a new experimental product called Atlantic Labs.
OpenAI announced a new deal with management consulting giant PwC. The company will become OpenAI’s biggest customer to date, covering 100,000 users, and will become OpenAI’s first partner for selling its enterprise offerings to other businesses.
OpenAI announced in a blog post that it has recently begun training its next flagship model to succeed GPT-4. The news came in an announcement of its new safety and security committee, which is responsible for informing safety and security decisions across OpenAI’s products.
On the The TED AI Show podcast, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner revealed that the board did not know about ChatGPT until its launch in November 2022. Toner also said that Sam Altman gave the board inaccurate information about the safety processes the company had in place and that he didn’t disclose his involvement in the OpenAI Startup Fund.
The launch of GPT-4o has driven the company’s biggest-ever spike in revenue on mobile, despite the model being freely available on the web. Mobile users are being pushed to upgrade to its $19.99 monthly subscription, ChatGPT Plus, if they want to experiment with OpenAI’s most recent launch.
After demoing its new GPT-4o model last week, OpenAI announced it is pausing one of its voices, Sky, after users found that it sounded similar to Scarlett Johansson in “Her.”
OpenAI explained in a blog post that Sky’s voice is “not an imitation” of the actress and that AI voices should not intentionally mimic the voice of a celebrity. The blog post went on to explain how the company chose its voices: Breeze, Cove, Ember, Juniper and Sky.
OpenAI announced new updates for easier data analysis within ChatGPT. Users can now upload files directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, interact with tables and charts, and export customized charts for presentations. The company says these improvements will be added to GPT-4o in the coming weeks.
OpenAI announced a partnership with Reddit that will give the company access to “real-time, structured and unique content” from the social network. Content from Reddit will be incorporated into ChatGPT, and the companies will work together to bring new AI-powered features to Reddit users and moderators.
OpenAI’s spring update event saw the reveal of its new omni model, GPT-4o, which has a black hole-like interface, as well as voice and vision capabilities that feel eerily like something out of “Her.” GPT-4o is set to roll out “iteratively” across its developer and consumer-facing products over the next few weeks.
The company announced it’s building a tool, Media Manager, that will allow creators to better control how their content is being used to train generative AI models — and give them an option to opt out. The goal is to have the new tool in place and ready to use by 2025.
In a new peek behind the curtain of its AI’s secret instructions, OpenAI also released a new NSFW policy. Though it’s intended to start a conversation about how it might allow explicit images and text in its AI products, it raises questions about whether OpenAI — or any generative AI vendor — can be trusted to handle sensitive content ethically.
In a new partnership, OpenAI will get access to developer platform Stack Overflow’s API and will get feedback from developers to improve the performance of their AI models. In return, OpenAI will include attributions to Stack Overflow in ChatGPT. However, the deal was not favorable to some Stack Overflow users — leading to some sabotaging their answer in protest.
Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and the Denver Post, are suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The lawsuit alleges that the companies stole millions of copyrighted articles “without permission and without payment” to bolster ChatGPT and Copilot.
OpenAI has partnered with another news publisher in Europe, London’s Financial Times, that the company will be paying for content access. “Through the partnership, ChatGPT users will be able to see select attributed summaries, quotes and rich links to FT journalism in response to relevant queries,” the FT wrote in a press release.
OpenAI is opening a new office in Tokyo and has plans for a GPT-4 model optimized specifically for the Japanese language. The move underscores how OpenAI will likely need to localize its technology to different languages as it expands.
According to Reuters, OpenAI’s Sam Altman hosted hundreds of executives from Fortune 500 companies across several cities in April, pitching versions of its AI services intended for corporate use.
Premium ChatGPT users — customers paying for ChatGPT Plus, Team or Enterprise — can now use an updated and enhanced version of GPT-4 Turbo. The new model brings with it improvements in writing, math, logical reasoning and coding, OpenAI claims, as well as a more up-to-date knowledge base.
You can now use ChatGPT without signing up for an account, but it won’t be quite the same experience. You won’t be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have “slightly more restrictive content policies,” according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear:
“The signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,” a spokesperson said.
TechCrunch found that the OpenAI’s GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that claim to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools.
In a court filing opposing OpenAI’s motion to dismiss The New York Times’ lawsuit alleging copyright infringement, the newspaper asserted that “OpenAI’s attention-grabbing claim that The Times ‘hacked’ its products is as irrelevant as it is false.” The New York Times also claimed that some users of ChatGPT used the tool to bypass its paywalls.
At a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI’s VP of consumer product dodged a question on whether artists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated. While OpenAI lets artists “opt out” of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous.
ChatGPT’s environmental impact appears to be massive. According to a report from The New Yorker, ChatGPT uses an estimated 17,000 times the amount of electricity than the average U.S. household to respond to roughly 200 million requests each day.
OpenAI released a new Read Aloud feature for the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps. The feature allows ChatGPT to read its responses to queries in one of five voice options and can speak 37 languages, according to the company. Read aloud is available on both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models.

As part of a new partnership with OpenAI, the Dublin City Council will use GPT-4 to craft personalized itineraries for travelers, including recommendations of unique and cultural destinations, in an effort to support tourism across Europe.
New York-based law firm Cuddy Law was criticized by a judge for using ChatGPT to calculate their hourly billing rate. The firm submitted a $113,500 bill to the court, which was then halved by District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who called the figure “well above” reasonable demands.
ChatGPT users found that ChatGPT was giving nonsensical answers for several hours, prompting OpenAI to investigate the issue. Incidents varied from repetitive phrases to confusing and incorrect answers to queries. The issue was resolved by OpenAI the following morning.
The dating app giant home to Tinder, Match and OkCupid announced an enterprise agreement with OpenAI in an enthusiastic press release written with the help of ChatGPT. The AI tech will be used to help employees with work-related tasks and come as part of Match’s $20 million-plus bet on AI in 2024.
As part of a test, OpenAI began rolling out new “memory” controls for a small portion of ChatGPT free and paid users, with a broader rollout to follow. The controls let you tell ChatGPT explicitly to remember something, see what it remembers or turn off its memory altogether. Note that deleting a chat from chat history won’t erase ChatGPT’s or a custom GPT’s memories — you must delete the memory itself.
https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1757469997742666052
Initially limited to a small subset of free and subscription users, Temporary Chat lets you have a dialogue with a blank slate. With Temporary Chat, ChatGPT won’t be aware of previous conversations or access memories but will follow custom instructions if they’re enabled.
But, OpenAI says it may keep a copy of Temporary Chat conversations for up to 30 days for “safety reasons.”
https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1757470007381082382
Paid users of ChatGPT can now bring GPTs into a conversation by typing “@” and selecting a GPT from the list. The chosen GPT will have an understanding of the full conversation, and different GPTs can be “tagged in” for different use cases and needs.
https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1752391522081980855
Screenshots provided to Ars Technica found that ChatGPT is potentially leaking unpublished research papers, login credentials and private information from its users. An OpenAI representative told Ars Technica that the company was investigating the report.
OpenAI has been told it’s suspected of violating European Union privacy, following a multi-month investigation of ChatGPT by Italy’s data protection authority. Details of the draft findings haven’t been disclosed, but in a response, OpenAI said: “We want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.”
In an effort to win the trust of parents and policymakers, OpenAI announced it’s partnering with Common Sense Media to collaborate on AI guidelines and education materials for parents, educators and young adults. The organization works to identify and minimize tech harms to young people and previously flagged ChatGPT as lacking in transparency and privacy.
After a letter from the Congressional Black Caucus questioned the lack of diversity in OpenAI’s board, the company responded. The response, signed by CEO Sam Altman and Chairman of the Board Bret Taylor, said building a complete and diverse board was one of the company’s top priorities and that it was working with an executive search firm to assist it in finding talent.
In a blog post, OpenAI announced price drops for GPT-3.5’s API, with input prices dropping to 50% and output by 25%, to $0.0005 per thousand tokens in, and $0.0015 per thousand tokens out. GPT-4 Turbo also got a new preview model for API use, which includes an interesting fix that aims to reduce “laziness” that users have experienced.
https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1750636119321120942
OpenAI has suspended AI startup Delphi, which developed a bot impersonating Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) to help bolster his presidential campaign. The ban comes just weeks after OpenAI published a plan to combat election misinformation, which listed “chatbots impersonating candidates” as against its policy.
Beginning in February, Arizona State University will have full access to ChatGPT’s Enterprise tier, which the university plans to use to build a personalized AI tutor, develop AI avatars, bolster their prompt engineering course and more. It marks OpenAI’s first partnership with a higher education institution.
After receiving the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for her novel The Tokyo Tower of Sympathy, author Rie Kudan admitted that around 5% of the book quoted ChatGPT-generated sentences “verbatim.” Interestingly enough, the novel revolves around a futuristic world with a pervasive presence of AI.
In a conversation with Bill Gates on the Unconfuse Me podcast, Sam Altman confirmed an upcoming release of GPT-5 that will be “fully multimodal with speech, image, code, and video support.” Altman said users can expect to see GPT-5 drop sometime in 2024.
OpenAI is forming a Collective Alignment team of researchers and engineers to create a system for collecting and “encoding” public input on its models’ behaviors into OpenAI products and services. This comes as a part of OpenAI’s public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a “democratic process” for determining the rules AI systems follow.
In a blog post, OpenAI announced users will not be allowed to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying until the company works out how effective their tools are for “personalized persuasion.”
Users will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions, and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting.
The company is also testing out a tool that detects DALL-E generated images and will incorporate access to real-time news, with attribution, in ChatGPT.
https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1746986660892741927
In an unannounced update to its usage policy, OpenAI removed language previously prohibiting the use of its products for the purposes of “military and warfare.” In an additional statement, OpenAI confirmed that the language was changed in order to accommodate military customers and projects that do not violate their ban on efforts to use their tools to “harm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property.”
Aptly called ChatGPT Team, the new plan provides a dedicated workspace for teams of up to 149 people using ChatGPT as well as admin tools for team management. In addition to gaining access to GPT-4, GPT-4 with Vision and DALL-E3, ChatGPT Team lets teams build and share GPTs for their business needs.
After some back and forth over the last few months, OpenAI’s GPT Store is finally here. The feature lives in a new tab in the ChatGPT web client, and includes a range of GPTs developed both by OpenAI’s partners and the wider dev community.
To access the GPT Store, users must be subscribed to one of OpenAI’s premium ChatGPT plans — ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Enterprise or the newly launched ChatGPT Team.

Following a proposed ban on using news publications and books to train AI chatbots in the U.K., OpenAI submitted a plea to the House of Lords communications and digital committee. OpenAI argued that it would be “impossible” to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and that they believe copyright law “does not forbid training.”
OpenAI published a public response to The New York Times’s lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law, claiming that the case is without merit.
In the response, OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use. It also makes the case that regurgitation is less likely to occur with training data from a single source and places the onus on users to “act responsibly.”
https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1744419710635229424?s=20
After being delayed in December, OpenAI plans to launch its GPT Store sometime in the coming week, according to an email viewed by TechCrunch. OpenAI says developers building GPTs will have to review the company’s updated usage policies and GPT brand guidelines to ensure their GPTs are compliant before they’re eligible for listing in the GPT Store. OpenAI’s update notably didn’t include any information on the expected monetization opportunities for developers listing their apps on the storefront.
https://twitter.com/refsrc/status/1742970484256366629
In an email, OpenAI detailed an incoming update to its terms, including changing the OpenAI entity providing services to EEA and Swiss residents to OpenAI Ireland Limited. The move appears to be intended to shrink its regulatory risk in the European Union, where the company has been under scrutiny over ChatGPT’s impact on people’s privacy.
ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.
November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.
Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.
There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.
Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.
Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.
Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.
GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.
A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.
ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.
Yes.
Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.
We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.
Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.
It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.
Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.
Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.
Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.
It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.
Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.
Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.
OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.
The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.
In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”
Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.
An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.
CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.
Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.
There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.
Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.
Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.
No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.
None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Advanced persistent teenagers | TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,2024-11-01,"If you ask some of the top cybersecurity leaders in the field what’s on their worry list, you might not expect bored teenagers to be top of mind. But in recent years, this entirely new generation of money-driven cybercriminals has caused some of the biggest hacks in history and shows no sign of slowing down.
Meet the “advanced persistent teenagers,” as dubbed by the security community. These are skilled, financially motivated hackers, like Lapsus$ and Scattered Spider, which have proven capable of digitally breaking into hotel chains, casinos, and technology giants. By using tactics that rely on credible email lures and convincing phone calls posing as a company’s help desk, these hackers can trick unsuspecting employees into giving up their corporate passwords or network access.
These attacks are highly effective, have caused huge data breaches affecting millions of people, and resulted in huge ransoms paid to make the hackers go away. By demonstrating hacking capabilities once limited to only a few nation states, the threat from bored teenagers has prompted many companies to reckon with the realization that they don’t know if the employees on their networks are really who they say they are, and not actually a stealthy hacker.
From the points of view of two leading security veterans, have we underestimated the threat from bored teenagers?
“Maybe not for much longer,” said Darren Gruber, technical advisor in the Office of Security and Trust at database giant MongoDB, during an onstage panel at TechCrunch Disrupt on Tuesday. “They don’t feel as threatened, they may not be in U.S. jurisdictions, and they tend to be very technical and learn these things in different venues,” said Gruber.
Plus, a key automatic advantage is that these threat groups also have a lot of time on their hands.
“It’s a different motivation than the traditional adversaries that enterprises see,” Gruber told the audience.
Gruber has firsthand experience dealing with some of these threats. MongoDB had an intrusion at the end of 2023 that led to the theft of some metadata, like customer contact information, but no evidence of access to customer systems or databases. The breach was limited, by all accounts, and Gruber said the attack matched tactics used by Scattered Spider. The attackers used a phishing lure to gain access to MongoDB’s internal network as if they were an employee, he said.
Having that attribution can help network defenders defend against future attacks, said Gruber. “It helps to know who you’re dealing with,” he said.
Heather Gantt-Evans, the chief information security officer at fintech card issuing giant Marqeta, who spoke alongside Gruber at TechCrunch Disrupt, told the audience that the motivations of these emerging threat groups of teenagers and young adults are “incredibly unpredictable,” but that their tactics and techniques weren’t particularly advanced, like sending phishing emails and tricking employees at phone companies into transferring someone’s phone number.
“The trend that we’re seeing is really around insider threat,” said Gantt-Evans. “It’s much more easier to manipulate your way in through a person than through hacking in with elaborate malware and exploitation of vulnerabilities, and they’re going to keep doing that.”
“Some of the biggest threats that we’re looking at right now relate to identity, and there’s a lot of questions about social engineering,” said Gruber.
The attack surface isn’t just limited to email or text phishing, he said, but any system that interacts with your employees or your customers. That’s why identity and access management are top of mind for companies like MongoDB to ensure that only employees are accessing the network.
Gantt-Evans said “we have a lot to learn” from hacking groups like Lapsus$, which carried out “human element” attacks, such as SIM swapping and sending phishing emails, but whose motivations were unpredictable. Some Lapsus$ members were later identified as neurodiverse.
“They don’t care that you’re not good at a mixer,” said Gantt-Evans. “We in cybersecurity need to do a better job at embracing neurodiverse talent, as well.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/apple-is-buying-photo-editing-app-pixelmator/,Apple is buying photo-editing app Pixelmator | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-11-01,"Pixelmator announced on Friday that it is being acquired by Apple. The image-editing platform didn’t discuss what life might look like under the corporate umbrella but did note there would be “no material changes” to its Pixelmator Pro, Pixelmator for iOS, and Photomator apps — at least for now.
If Apple’s acquisition history is any indication, that level of autonomy could change soon as Pixelmator’s features are integrated directly into the Photos app. Pixelmator is currently available for iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and visionOS, but not the Android ecosystem. I wouldn’t expect that last bit to change any time soon.
The image-editing startup has been around since 2007, when it was founded in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius.
“[L]ooking back, it’s crazy what a small group of dedicated people have been able to achieve over the years from all the way in Vilnius, Lithuania,” the company notes in their announcement. “Now, we’ll have the ability to reach an even wider audience and make an even bigger impact on the lives of creative people around the world.”
The deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval, comes as Apple has grown more aggressive about integrating AI into its imaging apps. The company recently rolled out Clean Up as part of an iOS update. That feature, which removes elements from photos, was regarded as Apple’s answer to Google’s Magic Eraser.
Apple declined to comment on the news."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/a-new-app-launches-to-help-keep-voters-informed-for-elections/,A new app launches to help keep voters informed for elections | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-11-01,"Around the corner is perhaps one of the most important elections this nation has ever seen, yet many people are still unaware of the details needed to cast informed ballots.
It’s not necessarily their fault — some voting information can be quite hard to find, especially when it comes to learning about, say, the political stances of judges up for recall or what a certain new amendment might mean for everyday life. In a very Silicon Valley way, there is an app looking to help with that called My Ballot Ai, an interactive mobile platform to help make voting information more accessible.
All a user has to do is type into a chat box what they want to know about any upcoming elections and they will receive real-time answers to their questions.
The app, founded by Mark Larman, was publicly launched on Friday. It is powered by Google Gemini and sources its data from the Google Civic API and the BallotReady API. A little noteworthy feature is that the app reveals its sources when responding with information, perhaps as a way to avoid the plagiarism accusations that have plagued other chatbots.
On My Ballot, users can also fill out a sample ballot so they can start to familiarize themselves with the language on the ballot. Larman said he hired a developer back in February and “it just feels like a blessing to have it finally ready in time for the election.”
This app comes at a critical time. Misinformation remains a concern among voters this election and one person in particular is causing a stir for election officials: Elon Musk. CNN reports that states are trying to fact-check the billionaire to stop him from spreading claims that will “mislead voters.” Meanwhile, Axios reported that Facebook users are falling for AI images of fake people giving endorsements, with a flood of AI-generated content — including video and audio — taking hold over the internet. All of this, paired with the fact that search engines have deprioritized news, makes it hard for the average voter to find credible information about voting.
Larman says he’s wanted to build an app like this since the 2020 election. He spent time that year protesting the murder of George Floyd and, when he found himself in the voting booth, he recalled looking at the ballot and not recognizing who any of the judges were.
“I was out there protesting and then when it came time to vote I didn’t even know which of these judges was for us or against us,” he said.
He spent the next three years thinking about creating a product that could effectively educate voters. When access to artificial intelligence was democratized, he took that opportunity to start building My Ballot Ai. Now, he’s in the process of fundraising and still works at his day job as he builds the app.
“The app is especially important now to exist as a verifiably non-biased source for information,” he continued, adding that voters feel like news right now is biased. “If people weren’t so uninformed and knew more about the issues and candidates they were voting for instead of just voting for the team, they’d feel less like they got cheated or lied to.”
Many young people are also taking to the polls for the first time. Efforts are made each election to engage young voters, who are less likely to vote than older people. Tufts estimates that in 2020, 50% of young people (considered between the ages of 18 to 29) voted in the presidential election, an increase from 39% in 2016.
Larman thinks young people are going to come out this election, pointing out that the youth are very active in politics, “but, on the other hand, they may be the least likely to take the effort to navigate the existing non-user friendly websites to learn about state and local elections and they certainly aren’t interested in reading any 100-page voting manuals sent to their house.”
My Ballot right now can be used anywhere in the U.S., though it says it has plans to expand to other countries soon.
Larman has other big plans for the app, too. He aims to build a networking component so that users will be able to directly ask questions to candidates running for office — he will start reaching out to representatives after the presidential election, just in time for the midterms. To boost engagement, Larman also hopes to add political quizzes that can then help give ballot recommendations and work with organizations and universities to reach even more voters.
“I want people to trust it as a tool that doesn’t necessarily care what you think, we just want you to think,” he said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/cross-posting-social-app-openvibe-now-supports-threads-too/,"Cross-posting social app Openvibe now supports Threads, too | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-11-01,"The decline of X (formerly Twitter) under Elon Musk has boosted engagement with alternative social networks like Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon, but it has also challenged early adopters who now have too many places to post. Naturally, some entrepreneurs are working to solve this problem with apps that let you cross-post to multiple platforms at once. One of these apps, Openvibe, is now making itself even more useful with its recent support for Meta’s Threads, the X competitor from Instagram.
Launched earlier this summer, Openvibe initially made it possible to stay connected with friends and followers across Mastodon, Nostr, and Bluesky, by allowing you to view posts in a combined timeline and cross-post to the different networks at once.
Similar to how an app called Trillian once aggregated instant messaging networks like AIM, ICQ, Yahoo!, Google Talk, and others in one place for easy chatting in the early 2000s, Openvibe does the same for the many social networks that want to become the new place to “tweet.” According to Openvibe CEO Matej Svancer, the company’s mission is to offer a friendly, “easy-to-use gateway” to the open social web, which today spans networks built on different protocols, like ActivityPub (Mastodon, Threads), AT Protocol (Bluesky), and Nostr.
While there are some existing bridges being built across these networks, they may require additional servers, mirror accounts, and user opt-ins, Svancer explained. He believed this wasn’t the best path forward, and that a simple cross-posting app would be a better solution to lower the barrier of entry for new users.
“I believe the open social space can challenge legacy social media, but only if it’s united,” the founder earlier told TechCrunch.
With the addition of Threads support, which rolled out to Openvibe this week across iOS and Android, users can now log in with their accounts and cross-post and reply across Threads, Mastodon, Bluesky, and Nostr. They can also follow people in unified feeds from all the networks and see suggested followers from each network, Svancer says.
He notes that, while the Threads API is still “quite limited,” Openvibe worked to take full advantage of the functionality it offered to create a user-friendly experience, where the app currently remains free to use and free from advertising. More features will be added over time as the Threads API itself evolves and improves, the founder noted.
Since launching support for Threads, some users reported having trouble getting the app to work, but Openvibe has pointed them to their troubleshooting documentation for assistance. This guide suggests that OAuth will sometimes not function properly and requires a series of specific steps to fix. (We were able to add Threads without issue, when testing, however.)
The new release that includes support for Threads also includes a few bug fixes and an updated post-composition flow that offers a “smoother, more reliable experience,” Openvibe claims.
The app is a free download on iOS and Android but later plans to experiment with a desktop version. To generate revenue, the app will later introduce a subscription plan, but that has yet to arrive.
Openvibe isn’t the only cross-posting app to address the problem of the alt-Twitters. In addition to more professional solutions aimed at social media marketers, Croissant is another consumer-facing app that supports cross-posting to Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon. However, it already has a subscription plan implemented, starting at $2.99 per month."

According to Reuters, Chinese researchers, including two affiliated with a PLA R&D group, used Meta’s Llama 2 AI model to create a military-focused chatbot. The chatbot, called ChatBIT, is designed to gather and process intelligence, Reuters reports, as well as offering information for operational decision-making.
Meta told Reuters in a statement that the use of the “single, and outdated” Llama model — Llama 2 is roughly a year old — was “unauthorized” and contrary to its acceptable use policy. Reuters says it wasn’t able to confirm ChatBIT’s capabilities or computing power.
The report provides some of the first evidence that China’s military has been trying to leverage open models for defense purposes — which is sure to fuel the debate over the merits and risks of open AI."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/instagram-upgrades-dms-with-focus-on-creators/,Instagram upgrades DMs with focus on creators | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-11-01,"Instagram on Friday announced an update to DMs, its direct messages inbox, which will improve the experience for those who receive a lot of inbound messages, like creators and influencers. Now, the app is introducing tools that will allow users to sort and filter their “message requests” — meaning those messages that don’t arrive in their main inbox, based on controls the user sets.
The new tools will give users the ability to sort and filter these message requests by follower count, verified accounts, brands, creators, and other factors. This will help the creator better identify those higher-priority messages that may deserve a response because of the impact they could have on the creator’s business and relationships.
In addition, a new “Story Replies” folder will be added to make story replies accessible in one place.
The company said the changes are being introduced after hearing from creators around the world how managing their DMs can be difficult.
“Now when you go to the requests inbox, sometimes it can be really overwhelming,” said Instagram head Adam Mosseri, in a post on the social network. “So what we’ve done is added ways to filter down those requests to just see the ones that you’re looking for,” he continued. “There’s a lot more to do to improve the inbox for creators and requests,” Mosseri admitted. “But hopefully, this is one step in the right direction.”
The “Sort & Filter” options will appear in an overlay on top of the inbox, where users can choose to sort requests by their recency or by the number of followers the sender has, helping to highlight those messages that could be from other creators or brands reaching out about business deals. Plus, they can check or uncheck other options to further narrow down what’s displayed by factors like whether the account is Verified, a business, a creator account, those that have a certain number of subscribers, and more.
Instagram says it will continue to invest in DMs over time.
The changes follow other inbox-related improvements Meta made earlier this week to WhatsApp, which now allows users to filter their chats by customized lists."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/former-caribou-founder-launches-further-a-fintech-thats-focused-on-helping-people-buy-homes/,"Former Caribou founder launches Further, a fintech that's focused on helping people buy homes | TechCrunch",Rebecca Szkutak,2024-11-01,"Buying a home has always been complicated. You have to figure out how much money to put down and how that down payment will affect a monthly mortgage bill. Then there are the closing costs and fees. Kevin Bennett launched Further to try to help make the financial process easier to navigate — especially for first-time buyers.
Further is a fintech platform that walks users through the financial side of home buying. The company’s first product, which goes live Friday, is a calculator that shows what people can afford and what their monthly mortgage payments and closing costs could look like, among other metrics based on real-time interest rates.
Unlike other mortgage calculators that you can find on Zillow and LendingTree, Further looks to give users more than the numbers. It tells users how easy it will be for them to find a loan based on their financial status, whether they should wait to buy, or if they should pursue specific types of loans based on their financial profile, among others.
The platform is currently free to use. The company plans to monetize once it releases more product developments but declined to share details.
“A generation ago, our parents bought a $200,000 home with a 20% mortgage, and it was very straightforward,” Bennett said. “There was one kind of mortgage, and that’s what you did and it’s just more complicated. There are lots of kinds of mortgages. There are lots of implications. Homes are much more expensive now, so there’s just a lot more complexity, and it’s a much bigger financial decision.”
Last year Bennett found himself looking for something new to work on after stepping back from Caribou, the auto loan refinancing startup he co-founded in 2016 and where he served as CEO. He knew he wanted to do something else mission-oriented but wasn’t sure where.
He started looking into real estate, a category he said he’s always been fascinated with. The fact that his whole family works in real estate helped, too. He started talking to folks who had purchased their home within the last two years and found a lot of common pain points: People didn’t understand the process and were relying on homemade spreadsheets to try to figure out what they could afford.
Bennett also had a personal experience: He bought and sold a townhouse in his 20s and was surprised to find out he endured a $30,000 loss, despite selling the home for the original purchase price. That’s because he missed out on certain home improvements that could’ve increased the house’s value.
“You can’t hit the undo button once you buy that house,” Bennett said. “It felt like there was a gap in the market. It felt like it was a lot more complicated than it was a generation ago.”
He reached out to his friend Chris Baker, a real estate expert, and former head of product at EasyKnock, about his idea last year. The pair got to work fast. Their first conversation was November 3, 2023. They decided to work together in January, launched the product in April, and raised an undisclosed pre-seed round in June. Now, they are coming out of stealth.
“Our goal is to take care of the complicated jargon and stuff and really help you understand as easily as possible what it is you need to know, with transparency, obviously, but also putting you in the driver’s seat and in control,” he said.
The company’s previously undisclosed pre-seed round raised $4.1 million from investors including Link Ventures, Vesta Ventures, and Fidi Ventures, among others. Bennett said that fundraising wasn’t too challenging, as half of the capital the company raised was from investors who backed him while he was at Caribou. Bennett thinks his track record as a founder made a big difference. The company built its cap table intentionally to include angel investors who have experience in the real estate market, he said.
This kind of financial information and guidance seems like something a Zillow or Redfin would be ripe to copy, especially considering Zillow already offers a mortgage calculator and some advice of its own. But Bennett said he wasn’t super concerned about the competition. He said he thinks that many companies either fall on the proptech side or the fintech side and rarely in the middle, as Further does, which gives it more of a moat.
But Further is definitely not the only company that sits between proptech and fintech that is aimed at consumers. Online mortgage startup Better.com, which allows consumers to browse for mortgage options or refinance an existing one, is a good example.
It will likely depend on what Further unveils in its planned Q1 product release that will include more features and capabilities, but Bennett didn’t share too many details just yet. For now, users can use Further to get an idea of what they can afford and what they can expect to pay when buying a house.
“My hope is that we can enable people with the right insights and information to make good decisions and plan for this really big part of their life in a way that gives them confidence, puts them at ease, and and lets them focus on, you know, what they really want to focus on, which is kind of that dream of being a homeowner,” Bennett said."

“Investor and shareholder expectations are often not aligned with how hard and intractable the problems are that we face as a society,” Allison Wolff, co-founder and CEO of Vibrant Planet, said on the Builders Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. “I think in some ways, we’re a little bit stuck.”
But it’s not impossible.
Wolff’s company develops cloud-based software for utilities, insurers, and land managers like the U.S. Forest Service to model and respond to wildfire risk. To ensure the company keeps its eye on the mission, it has registered as a public benefit corporation, which requires companies to report on impact in addition to the usual financial information.
“That’s an elegant structure to consider if you haven’t already, and it’s easy to convert,” she said. “And it’s a good forcing function to do the reporting side of that, to really think through every year, what impact are we having, and how do we account for it.”
Another approach is to find a technology and business model that tightly couples purpose and profit. That’s what Areeb Malik and his co-founders did when launching Glacier, their robotic recycling company.
“When I was starting my company, I was looking for the right opportunity, and it was really about aligning profitability with impacts,” he said onstage.
“If you can find a place where you can align, for instance, climate impact, the thing that I’m super passionate about, with making money, then I welcome a PE fund to come and take over my business, because they will juice us for money. That money directly correlates with climate impact.”
Holding fast to the mission isn’t necessarily enough, though, Hyuk-Jeen Suh, general partner at SkyRiver Ventures, said at Disrupt. Mission means nothing if a company’s reach remains limited.
“A lot of founders get focused so much on making their widget that that one widget is all they care about. They haven’t figured out how to build the foundation for scale,” he said. “When you’re making a widget, you have to think, how am I going to mass produce this? How am I going to mass market this?”
If that all sounds like too much for startups to juggle, that maybe the mission part should fall to the wayside while they master the basics, Suh said that sort of ambition is actually a sign that the companies are on the right track. “They almost have to bite more than they can chew, because without that boldness and vision, I think it will be difficult to really make an impact.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/indonesia-bans-google-pixel-sales-after-iphone-16-block/,Indonesia blocks Google Pixel sales after ban on iPhone 16 | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-11-01,"Indonesia has banned sales of Google Pixel smartphones for failing to meet domestic content requirements, days after blocking Apple’s iPhone 16 in Southeast Asia’s largest phone market.
The Indonesian Ministry of Industry said Google’s phones cannot be traded until they comply with rules requiring 40% local content in smartphones sold in Indonesia.
Google must obtain local content certification before resuming sales, Industry Ministry spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arief told local reporters. “The local content rule and related policies are made for fairness for all investors that invest in Indonesia, and for creating added value and deepening the industry structure here,” Hendri was quoted as saying.
The ban follows Indonesia’s block on iPhone 16 sales last week after Apple failed to meet a $95 million investment commitment. Major smartphone makers must manufacture devices, develop firmware, or invest in local innovation to meet Indonesia’s content rules.
The Indonesian rule requires tech companies to source 40% of handset and tablet components domestically, a requirement that can be met through local manufacturing, firmware development, or direct investment in innovation projects.
Companies can satisfy the requirements through different routes. Samsung and Xiaomi, for instance, have established manufacturing facilities, while Apple has opted to open developer academies.
The regulation, enforced through a certification system called “local content level,” forms part of Indonesia’s broader industrial policy to leverage its large consumer market for domestic economic development. Companies failing to meet these thresholds face sales restrictions.
Neither Google nor Apple rank among Indonesia’s top five smartphone brands, according to marketing research firm Counterpoint."

But Musk skipped his courthouse appointment after the same judge granted a request to transfer the case from Pennsylvania state to federal jurisdiction.
Musk has donated tens of millions of dollars to America PAC, a super PAC formed this summer to support former president Donald Trump. America PAC recently began entering signers of a petition to support the right to bear arms and free speech into a lottery for the aforementioned $1 million award.
Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner sued the super PAC over its plan, accusing America PAC of “interfer[ing] with the integrity of elections.” America PAC has also been warned by the Justice Department that it might be violating federal laws about paying voters.
After the transfer request was granted, Krasner asked that the case be sent back to state court. A federal judge has ordered Musk’s legal team to file a response by Friday morning."

TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 is a wrap, and I’m more than thrilled by the amazing space industry programming we had on offer this year.
We covered everything from building a dual-use business to orbital re-entry, we caught up with Rocket Lab’s Peter Beck, and heard about the ground station problem from Bridgit Mendler. Below, I hit some of the highlights, but this is just a fraction of the topics we covered onstage, so be sure to head over to TechCrunch.com to catch the full coverage.

Former Disney channel star Bridgit Mendler made a splash when she announced that she was co-founding a space startup focused on one the least sexy aspects of the industry: ground stations. We talked about her past career in the entertainment industry and her future path as a space CEO.
“To actually fulfill the benefit of people in the world, you have to invest in unsexy problems, like building a ground network,” Mendler said. “I personally think that’s pretty sexy and fun. It’s absolutely not what most people think of when they think of the space industry. I think they think of rockets, they think of satellites, but they don’t think about ground infrastructure.”
All eyes will be on Rocket Lab early next year, as the company looks to launch its Neutron rocket, the answer to the “medium-launch monopoly” that exists today, as CEO Peter Beck put it onstage. It’s part of the company’s plan to build out an end-to-end space company.
Indeed, launch is far from the only core part of the business: Rocket Lab also builds spacecraft for interplanetary missions, supplies spacecraft components, and more. Part of the purpose of Neutron is to enable repeat launches of Rocket Lab’s own satellites.
“Spacecraft are way easier to build than rockets,” Beck said. “They really are.”
He also talked scaling the space supply chain, with the added anecdote that Sinclair Interplanetary, a spacecraft component business that Rocket Lab bought in 2020, used to produce 150 reaction wheels but now has scaled production to over 2,000 annually."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-hints-at-an-agentic-alexa/,Amazon CEO Andy Jassy hints at an 'agentic' Alexa | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-31,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday hinted at an improved, “agentic” version of the company’s Alexa assistant — one that could take actions on a user’s behalf.
“I think that the next generation of these assistants and generative AI applications will be better at not just answering questions and summarizing, indexing, and aggregating data, but also taking actions,” he said during Amazon’s Q3 2024 earnings call. “And you can imagine us being pretty good at that with Alexa.”
Jassy added that Amazon continues to “re-architect the brain” of Alexa with “a new set of foundation models” that the company plans to reveal “in the near future.”
Amazon, which first announced that it’d revamp Alexa with generative AI technologies in 2023, is said to be replacing its own Alexa-powering models with Anthropic’s after encountering technical challenges. (Amazon is a major investor in Anthropic.) At one point during the Alexa redesign, the unreleased, upgraded assistant reportedly struggled to turn on smart lights and took up to six seconds to respond to queries.
The new Alexa, code-named “Remarkable Alexa” internally, will reportedly cost $5 to $10 per month, offered alongside a less capable free plan. Some reports indicated that it would arrive in October, but it’s seemingly suffering delays.
Bloomberg reports the timeline has slipped into 2025.
Despite being in over a half billion devices worldwide, Alexa hasn’t contributed meaningfully to Amazon’s bottom line. The company has lost tens of billions of dollars in its devices business since 2017, according to The Wall Street Journal."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/us-drone-maker-skydio-faces-battery-squeeze-after-chinese-sanctions/,US drone maker Skydio faces battery squeeze after Chinese sanctions | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-31,"America’s supply chain vulnerabilities were on full display Thursday after drone manufacturer Skydio told customers it was facing a battery squeeze after being hit with sanctions from China.
“This is an attempt to eliminate the leading American drone company and deepen the world’s dependence on Chinese drone suppliers,” Skydio CEO Adam Bry said in a letter to customers first reported by the Financial Times.
The company, which provides drones to Ukraine’s military and Taiwan’s National Fire Agency, manufactures its products in the United States but still relies on a global supply chain for many of its components; one of the most critical components, batteries, are still sourced in China. As a result of the sanctions, which bar Chinese companies from doing business with Skydio, customers will be limited to one battery per drone, Skydio told customers.
While Skydio has a “substantial stock” of batteries on hand, it doesn’t anticipate new sources coming online until spring of next year. In the meantime, the company is extending the software license, warranty, and support term for orders affected by the battery ration by the length of time it takes for the full complement of batteries to be delivered.
Skydio is America’s largest drone manufacturer and operates an enterprise-only business after shutting down its consumer drone business in 2023. It has sent thousands of its drones to Ukraine to aid that country’s war-fighting efforts.
“This is a clarifying moment for the drone industry,” Bry said. “If there was ever any doubt, this action makes clear that the Chinese government will use supply chains as a weapon to advance their interests over ours.”
The drone maker has sought help from the Biden administration and has been in touch with Taiwan’s vice president Hsiao Bi-khim as it faces this crisis, the Financial Times reported. The sanctions, which were imposed on October 10 and included two other companies, were reportedly imposed in retaliation for the U.S. government’s announcement that it would provide additional military assistance for Taiwan.
Ten executives were also sanctioned, including Bry and Skydio’s Asia-Pacific general manager Tom Moss.
This isn’t the first time the U.S. and China have traded jabs over drone technoloy: DJI, the world’s largest drone maker, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government earlier this month over being designated a “Chinese military company,” claiming the designation is “unlawful and misguided.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/decarts-ai-simulates-a-real-time-playable-version-of-minecraft/,"Decart's AI simulates a real-time, playable version of Minecraft | TechCrunch",Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-31,"Decart, an Israeli AI company that emerged from stealth today with $21 million in funding from Sequoia and Oren Zeev, has released what it’s claiming is the first playable “open-world” AI model.
Called Oasis, the model, which is available for download, powers a demo on Decart’s site: a Minecraft-like game that’s generated on the fly, end to end. Trained on videos of Minecraft gameplay, Oasis takes in keyboard and mouse movements and generates frames in real time, simulating physics, rules, and graphics.
Oasis is part of an emerging category of generative AI models called “world models.” Many of these models can simulate games — but few at frame rates as high as Oasis.
I tried the demo out of curiosity, and I’d say it has a ways to go before it’s a genuinely fun experience. The resolution is quite low, and Oasis tends to quickly “forget” the level layout — I’d turn my character around only to see a rearranged landscape.
Decart’s adding new features, however, such as the ability to upload an image to create a custom “world.” And it says that future versions of Oasis, which was optimized to run on Etched’s upcoming AI accelerator chips (the demo currently runs on Nvidia H100 GPUs), could generate up to 4K gameplay.
“[These] models may even augment modern entertainment platforms by generating content on the fly according to the user preferences,” Decart writes in a blog post. “Or perhaps a gaming experience that provides new possibilities for the user interaction such as textual and audio prompts guiding the gameplay.”
I wonder about the copyright implications. Decart doesn’t say that it got Microsoft’s blessing to train on footage of Minecraft. (Microsoft owns Minecraft.) Is Oasis basically creating an unauthorized copy of Minecraft? That’s for the courts to decide."

The firm is known for backing exclusively women founders, and this new fund is a slight departure from that focus but comes as funding to diverse founders continues to dip. Crunchbase found that Black founders, for example, landed just 0.3% of all capital raised in the first half of this year, continuing a downward trend that has shown no signs of reversal, Crunchbase senior data reporter Gené Teare told me.
Nisha Dua, the co-founder of BBG Ventures, told Business Insider that returning LPs increased their fund commitments for this fund and that new LPs include Melinda French Gates’ Pivotal Ventures and Fairview Capital. The latest BBG fund will focus on diverse founders building in healthcare, fintech, and AI."

The news makes FFF one of the few diverse-focused funds to fully return a fund in a move that may boost the image of investing in women founders across Silicon Valley.
Any further investments and exits to come from Fund I will be profitable for investors. Fortune reports that many young firms like this never return their first funds. FFF was founded in 2014 with the goal of backing early-stage female-founded companies. Its investments include the healthcare company Peanut, the astrology app Co-Star, and the healthcare unicorn Maven. TechCrunch reported a year ago that FFF is now raising $75 million for Fund IV."

TechCrunch spoke to Sparta back in 2018 at the offices of Playground Global, a key investor.
The deal marks Oura’s third acquisition in two years. The company purchased digital identity platform Proxy in May 2023. This September, it added Veri to the list, as it looks to grow out its metabolic health/diabetes monitoring capabilities.Sparta’s primary offering is the health platform Trinsic, which tracks health vitals for enterprise clients. The technology will be integrated into the hardware firm’s B2B offering, Oura Business.
Business applications have played an increasingly important role in the world of health-based wearables in recent years. Oura Business lets employers purchase the ring in bulk or through gift cards, allowing employees to choose their specific size and color.
“Through our work over the years with partners like the Department of Defense, we’ve proved that Oura Ring is uniquely positioned to support population health remotely and at scale,” Oura’s chief commercial officer says in a release. “The addition of Sparta Science and its Trinsic data platform will help us meet the specific needs of our partners.”
Oura says it will continue to support Sparta’s force plates through the end of the year, at which point it will end production on the clinical-grade hardware. Oura Ring 4, the wearable firm’s latest hardware, was released in October."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-lack-of-compute-is-delaying-the-companys-products/,OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says lack of compute capacity is delaying the company's products | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-31,"In a Reddit AMA, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitted that a lack of compute capacity is one major factor preventing the company from shipping products as often as it’d like.
“All of these models have gotten quite complex,” he wrote in response to a question about why OpenAI’s next AI models were taking so long. “We also face a lot of limitations and hard decisions about [how] we allocated our compute towards many great ideas.”
Many reports suggest that OpenAI has struggled to secure enough compute infrastructure to run and train its generative models. Just this week, Reuters, citing sources, said that OpenAI has for months been working with Broadcom to create an AI chip for running models, which could arrive as soon as 2026.
Partly as a result of strained capacity, Altman said, OpenAI’s realistic-sounding conversational feature for ChatGPT, Advanced Voice Mode, won’t be getting the vision capabilities first teased in April anytime soon. At its April press event, OpenAI showed the ChatGPT app running on a smartphone and responding to visual cues, such as the clothes someone was wearing, within view of the phone’s camera.
Reporting from Fortune later revealed the demo was rushed to steal attention away from Google’s I/O developer conference, which was taking place the same week. Many within OpenAI didn’t think GPT-4o was ready to be revealed. Tellingly, the voice-only version of Advanced Voice Mode was delayed for months.
In the AMA, Altman indicated that the next major release of OpenAI’s image generator, DALL-E, has no launch timeline. (“We don’t have a release plan yet,” he said.) Meanwhile, Sora, OpenAI’s video-generating tool, has been held back by the “need to perfect the model, get safety/impersonation/other things right, and scale compute,” wrote Kevin Weil, OpenAI’s chief product officer, who also participated in the AMA.
Sora has reportedly suffered from technical setbacks that position it poorly against rival systems from Luma, Runway, and others. Per The Information, the original system, revealed in February, took more than 10 minutes of processing time to make a 1-minute video clip.
In October, one of the co-leads on Sora, Tim Brooks, left for Google.
Later in the AMA, Altman said that OpenAI’s still considering allowing “NSFW” content in ChatGPT “someday” (“we totally believe in treating adult users like adults,” he wrote), and that the company’s top priority is improving its o1 series of “reasoning” models and their successors. OpenAI previewed a number of features coming to o1 at its DevDay conference in London this week, including image understanding.
“We have some very good releases coming later this year,” Altman wrote. “Nothing that we are going to call GPT-5, though.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/carl-pei-says-nothing-could-build-its-own-operating-system/,Carl Pei says Nothing could build its own operating system | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-31,"Two mobile operating systems currently comprise nearly 100% of the global smartphone market. Building one is hard, and for most phone makers, there are better uses of resources, especially when Android is right there for the taking. While it’s a potential differentiator, these companies have largely opted to maintain Google’s mobile OS, customized by skins and unique features.
Huawei recently bucked the trend with the release of Harmony OS, though that was a direct product of geopolitical restrictions on using American products. Despite its massive resources, however, the Chinese electronics giant struggled tremendously as it scrambled to build its own Android alternative.
Given its penchant for shaking up the market, perhaps it’s not wholly surprising that London-based Nothing could build its own mobile OS from the ground up. At TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 on Wednesday, founder and CEO Carl Pei confirmed that the company is exploring what a true Nothing OS could look like.
Pei praised smartphones as “our most important gateway to the people we care about and the information we need to consume,” while criticizing the industry’s Google/Apple duopoly.
“We’re thinking about how we maneuver here,” he added, “and maybe create something of our own. Some kind of operating system.”
The goals of such a move would be to extend Nothing’s impact on the industry, while creating an entirely new revenue stream.
“Now you can make impact on the software side,” Pei explained. “You can change how people use their devices. On the business side, it’s also very lucrative. In some ways, it kind of sucks to be a hardware company, because the supply chain, high capex, low margins, and high risk for product market fit. In a lot of ways, having some software revenue is a lot more comfortable: higher margins. But I think the most important thing is still to satisfy the consumer.”
The founder said he thinks the process of building a mobile OS has become significantly easier, thanks to the recent AI boom. Such technology will also go a long way toward offering a level of customization that has been lacking on existing platforms.
“If you think about the tech stack for what an OS is, I don’t think we need to work on the lower parts of the stack — drivers and how hardware connects to software and the kernel,” Pei added. “I don’t think we need to work on that, but we should work on innovating the user experience, because operating systems haven’t really changed for 40 years. These computers, smartphones, and these devices have so much information on us. We do so much on them, but they don’t leverage any of that information to make the experience any better.”
Asked whether the company was looking to raise in order to build out such a project, Pei declined to comment.
“I don’t think it needs to be very experienced,” he said. “This is applied AI, this is not foundational. We’re not building capabilities; we’re not training large language models; we’re not building text to speech or any of that. That ship has sailed, and it’s going to get hyper competitive. Two or three players are going to win big and the rest are going to lose money.”
Pei continued: “Irrespective of [whether] funding comes or not, it’s something we can work on.”
AI would be an important piece of such an operating system, he explained, but not the be-all and end-all.
“We shouldn’t call it the AI operating system,” he said. “AI is just a tool, and ultimately it comes down to who can make the best product, who can create the best market fit, get the highest user satisfaction. Because in the absence of that, it’s just not going to work.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/kalshi-secures-tens-of-millions-in-loans-from-vcs-eyes-50m-round-amid-election-betting-boom-source-says/,"Kalshi secures tens of millions in loans from VCs, eyes $50M+ round amid election betting boom, source says | TechCrunch",Marina Temkin,2024-10-31,"Investors are rushing to throw millions at a hot startup called Kalshi as loans or even as unusual we’ll-figure-it-out later cash. Kalshi is an exchange that allows people to bet, as official commodity trading contracts, on the outcomes of cultural events, from election results to how long Taylor Swift’s latest album will top the charts.
Betting on the outcome of the upcoming U.S. election has spiked demand so high that Kalshi surged to the top spot on Apple’s App Store, after years of being unranked among the finance category and to the seventh position overall as of this writing.
Kalshi’s need for cash reserves increased sharply to ensure it can provide instant funding for customers betting on the U.S. election. So, over the last several days, the Sequoia-backed 5-year-old startup has received tens of millions from investors in short-term loans, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. Additionally, the company is currently in discussions with new and existing investors about raising a formal equity round of as much as $50 million, though it is also possible the startup could raise more, the person said.
Investors who provided capital to Kalshi so the company could sustain its growth until election day included VC firm Neo, one of its earliest backers. Neo’s founder, Ali Partovi, sent Kalshi a total of $12.4 million, composed of $5.4 million of Neo’s capital and $7 million of Partovi’s personal funds, according to the now-deleted tweet posted by Kalshi’s co-founder and CEO, Tarek Mansour. While it’s extremely rare for investors to send money (much less millions) without terms locked down and a signed contract, Partovi’s message to Mansour said, “We can figure out the terms later.”
Kalshi didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Kalshi opened its election market last month after a judge denied the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s request to block the trading of elections-linked derivatives. (The CFTC is appealing the court’s ruling.) Since then, the company traded nearly $200 million in contract value for people wanting to bet on the outcome of the political race, Mansour told CNBC on Monday. “The demand curve is truly exponential,” he said.
Kalshi rushed to boost its cash position in anticipation of additional betting on the U.S. election. Like most brokerages, the company offers instant funding to new users. This means users can start trading right away, even though it may take two to three business days for the funds to be officially transferred from the customer’s bank account to Kalshi’s.
Although investors suppose that Kalshi’s growth spike will subside after the election, they believe the company grew so much over the last month that it won’t revert to its prior size, the person said.
Since Kalshi won the ruling against the CFTC, other companies began to offer election contract trading for U.S. citizens. On Monday, Robinhood introduced a market for betting on the presidential election. Interactive Brokers also launched election contracts following Kalshi’s legal victory.
In addition to Sequoia and Neo, Kalshi’s backers include Y Combinator, Henry Kravis, and Mantis VC, a fund managed. The company raised a total of $106 million in equity capital and was last valued at $787 million, according to PitchBook data."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/ford-pauses-f-150-lightning-production-as-tesla-cybertruck-heats-up/,Ford pauses F-150 Lightning production as Tesla Cybertruck heats up | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-10-31,"Ford will pause production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck starting in mid-November for almost two months as it struggles with decreased demand, increased competition, and losses in its electric vehicle business.
“We continue to adjust production for an optimal mix of sales growth and profitability,” a Ford spokesperson told TechCrunch. The news was previously reported by Automotive News.
The decision to halt production comes as the Tesla Cybertruck has pushed past Ford’s popular Mach-E to become the third best-selling EV in America. It also follows incumbent rival General Motors beating Ford in electric vehicle sales for the third quarter. GM sold 32,095 EVs, topping Ford’s 23,509 electric models.
During an earnings call earlier this week, Ford said it expected full-year Model e revenue to hit $1.2 billion. That’s on top of projected losses of about $5.5 billion, which is slightly lower than expected but still higher than losses in 2023. Model e is Ford’s EV business, which the automaker reports on separately from its Ford Blue gas-powered car business and Ford Pro commercial business.
The F-150 Lightning is produced at Ford’s Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan. The automaker will pause production starting November 15, which is a Friday. The plant will remain closed until January 6, 2025. The pause includes the holiday break week that Ford usually gives to its U.S. plants starting December 23.
The pause follows cuts of one-third of staff at the plant earlier this year, and it comes ahead of the U.S. election next week. Government support for EVs has been an issue of debate in Michigan, which is a major swing state.
In response to weakening demand for EVs and rising costs to produce battery-powered cars, Ford said in August it would delay plans to produce an electric three-row SUV and a next-generation EV pickup.
A year ago, Ford slashed its production target for the F-150 Lightning to match demand.
During the earnings call this week, Ford CEO Jim Farley noted that the automaker is focused on hybrid vehicles.
“Most of our competitors don’t offer hybrid on an F-150 or a Maverick. And this has been a fantastic revenue opportunity for us. We frankly can’t keep up with the demand,” Farley said. “And I think that has encouraged us to put hybrid across a whole lineup and be more curious about other partial electric solutions, which we’ll talk to you about.”"

TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 is wrapped! And what a whirlwind it was. Some highlights? Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson weighed in on whether Tesla robotaxis will launch next year in California (“no” and he explains why) and made a significant announcement on his own company. Meanwhile, Rivian’s head of software Wassym Bensaid said buttons are an anomaly (the future is voice) and gave us a few more details about where the fruits of the Rivian-VW joint venture deal might end up. Hint: Scout Motors.
Missed the interviews? Here is the full interview with Levinson and the one with Bensaid.
There was, of course, so much more, including GM chairperson and CEO Mary Barra, who covered a lot of ground on AVs, China, and EVs in an interview with global managing editor Matt Rosoff. For one, she still sees a future where GM makes an autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or pedals (RIP, Origin). You can catch the whole interview here.
And how could I forget, BANF made it to the Startup Battlefield top 20.
A little bird told us about some job movement over at Rivian. Specifically, Rivian’s head of battery manufacturing engineering Kenton Harris has left the company and is now the global chief engineer at Ford.

Remember when Waymo raised $5 billion over the summer? Welp, the company’s round is a bit bigger now. The company closed a $5.6 billion Series C funding round led by parent company Alphabet and joined by a who’s who of Silicon Valley venture firms.
Waymo was mum on the specifics, saying only that it was a “multi-year” commitment. Andreessen Horowitz, Silver Lake, Fidelity, Tiger Global, Perry Creek, and T. Rowe Price all joined the round. Waymo declined to say how much each invested.
Reminder, this is the Alphabet subsidiary’s second external fundraising round, and its first since a $2.25 billion Series B in 2020 that eventually grew to $3.2 billion.
OK, this was not on my bingo card and something I missed, but VC Reilly Brennan spotted it (and shared on his newsletter). Applied Intuition acquired the IP of Ghost Autonomy, the AV startup that shuttered earlier this year.
Infinite Machines, the New York-based startup developing a cyberpunk-inspired electric scooter, raised $9 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz’s American Dynamism team.
Joby Aviation, the electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle startup, launched a public offering to sell up to $200 million of its shares of common stock. Joby said it will use the proceeds from the raise — together with its existing cash — to fund its certification and manufacturing efforts, prepare for commercial launch in 2025, and use for general working capital.
This is more of a dead deal: Electric aircraft startup Lilium said it will shut down after failing to raise emergency money from the German government. The filing came after a series of setbacks from the German company that was once a darling in the nascent industry of electric aircraft. Reminder: Lilium had raised more than $1 billion from investors before going public in 2021 on the Nasdaq Exchange via a reverse merger with a blank-check company, SPAC Qell.
Third Wave Automation, a developer of autonomous high-reach forklifts powered by Shared Autonomy, raised $27 million in a Series C round led by Toyota’s fund Woven Capital. Innovation Endeavors, Norwest Venture Partners, and Qualcomm Ventures also joined the round, bringing total capital raised to $97 million.
WeRide debuted on the Nasdaq last week, joining the increasing number of Chinese companies accessing foreign markets. The autonomous vehicle startup raised $440.5 million, and its valuation has now topped $4 billion. Impressive, but less than the $5 billion the company had been going for.
Zero, the electric motorcycle company, is in the process of closing a new funding round for a little bit more than $120 million. Zero has sold around $100 million of the equity round so far from two undisclosed investors.
Aurora Innovation delayed its commercial self-driving truck launch to spring 2025.
During Disrupt, editor-in-chief Connie Loizos interviewed investor Vinod Khosla and transportation did in fact come up. He mentioned a startup he has invested in called Glydways. He believes that Glydways, which is developing personal, autonomous pods designed to operate on narrow, dedicated paths, can replace most cars in most of our cities in the next 25 years. The answer is not robotaxis.
“That sounds radical, but these entrepreneurs want to make that happen, and I’m pretty certain it will happen, and it’s not roboatxis; it’s not Waymo. It’s a much better solution.”
Scout Motors, the Volkswagen Group spinoff, unveiled two EVs it hopes will hook American customers with modern-meets-rugged styling that downplays digital and embraces the mechanical. But in a twist, the company has also added a variant to its all-electric Scout Traveler SUV and Scout Terra truck that will come equipped with a built-in gas-powered generator. Which one do you think will sell better? I have my thoughts, but we’ll have to wait until 2027 (when the vehicles go into production) to find out.
Tesla’s $25,000 EV flip-flop, explained.
Kyte, the rental car startup that bills itself as the “best alternative to Hertz,” is pulling out of almost all of its major markets in the United States and has cut its workforce roughly in half in a bid to survive after exploring a sale earlier this year.
Lyft agreed to a $2.1 million settlement proposed by the Federal Trade Commission over the ride-hailing company’s “deceptive earnings claims about how much money drivers could expect to make.”
Jon McNeill, former Tesla president and ex-Lyft COO who is now CEO of VC firm DVx Ventures, talked about innovation through subtraction at the World Business Forum. He also talked about the Tesla robotaxi and why EV startups fail.
Right before TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, I went over to Zoox HQ in Foster City, California, to try out its custom-built robotaxi. To be clear, this was a rather short ride from one Zoox building to another one about a mile away.
However, the robotaxi encountered traffic, completed a right turn on red and an unprotected left, and reached speeds beyond 35 miles per hour. It wasn’t jerky, and in that brief ride the system maneuvered confidently. The next step? Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson told me onstage that the company is going to start offering rides in its robotaxis on public roads in San Francisco and Las Vegas.
What is “This week’s wheels”? It’s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we’re testing, whether it’s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike, or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/meta-is-making-a-robot-hand-that-can-feel-touch/,Meta is making a robot hand that can 'feel' touch | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-31,"Meta says it’s partnering with sensor firm GelSight and Wonik Robotics, a South Korean robotics company, to commercialize tactile sensors for AI.
The new devices aren’t meant for consumers. Rather, they’re intended for scientists. Meta says it envisions them being used to advance research into AI that can “learn about the world in richer detail” and “better understand and model the physical world.”
GelSight will work with Meta to bring to market Digit 360, which Meta describes as a “a tactile fingertip with human-level multimodal sensing capabilities.” The successor to Meta’s Digit sensor, Digit 360 digitizes touch signals, using an on-device AI chip and roughly 18 “sensing features” to detect changes in its surroundings.
“We developed a touch-perception-specific optical system with a wide field of view … for capturing omnidirectional deformations on the fingertip surface,” Meta explained in a blog post. “Additionally, we equipped the sensor with many sensing modalities, since each touch interaction with the environment has a unique profile produced by the mechanical, geometrical, and chemical properties of a surface to perceive vibrations, sense heat, and even smell odor.”
Digit 360 will be available for purchase next year, and Meta’s launched a call for proposals through which researchers can gain early access.
Meta’s work with Wonik will focus on a new generation of Wonik’s Allegro Hand, a robotic hand with tactile sensors like Digit 360. Building on a platform Meta developed to integrate sensors on a single robot hand, the upcoming Allegro Hand will feature control boards that encode data from the tactile sensors onto a host computer.
The Allegro Hand will be available starting next year."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/three-investors-talk-the-highs-and-lows-of-space-investing/,Three investors talk the highs and lows of space investing | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-31,"The space industry operates in waves: There are massive highs and big lows, but it’s always exhilarating. Three venture capitalists who invest in space joined us onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt on Monday to talk about what’s coming next for this dynamic area.
Much of the current investing is shadowed by the SPAC boom in 2021 and subsequent bust, which saw many of those companies’ valuations dwindle to a fraction of their former value. But it’s hard to tell whether the industry has recovered from this event, particularly given that the route to exits is unclear, Embedded Ventures co-founder Jordan Noone said.
“This SPAC wave was, I think, a one-time phenomena, and those lessons are learned where the investors that did go through those some made money, some didn’t, some were spectacular exits, some were catastrophic, but the current market doesn’t support that,” he said. “I do think routes to exits is a big question that’s coming up in the current wave of startups, whether those are growth companies or those are day one companies.”
Lewis Jones, investment GP at Seraphim Space, said the SPAC phenomenon was ultimately healthy for the industry, however painful it was for investors at the time: “I think people recognize now that you can’t take space companies public prematurely,” he said. “The acquisitions that have been around the last few quarters haven’t necessarily been desirable outcomes, and we haven’t necessarily seen a pathway to a space company going public properly and winning out on that. So hopefully that shake-up means people start thinking about it, and there’ll be some good opportunities in the future.”
But if the past caused some investors to shy away from investing in space, it didn’t shy away from all of them — Katelin Holloway, founding partner at Seven Seven Six, said that while her firm has only made three investments in space, she expects it to grow in the future.
“For decades, people have been working deeply and desperately on this advancement in technology, the advancement in funding and getting attention. So you’re seeing NASA giving grants, yes, but they’re very risk averse. And so what you’re seeing now are people who are very into risk, very risk heavy, helping to push things forward,” she said.
Much of the risk doesn’t come from the technical risk, but rather the market risk. As the industry matures, and moves into the application layer, there are a lot of less tech-risky bets to be made in the application layer, Jones said.
“I’m looking a lot at downstream geospatial startups,” he said. “You’re not necessarily betting on their ability to develop novel AI algorithms. It’s very much, how do you leverage the data? And it becomes a lot more market centric than it does tech-centric.”
Ultimately, Holloway said, the teams that win will be those that ship.
“The teams that are going to be the ones that win are the ones that are going to outperform by shipping. We’ve had a bevy of companies that dream really big, beautiful, incredible ideas that are very awe-inspiring, but they cannot deliver. And so the companies that are going to be the ones that win are the ones that can ship and ship very quickly.”
In terms of future opportunities for investing, Noone said he’s excited by things that have become economically and technically possible in space as launch costs have gone down, like orbital delivery, manufacturing in space, and a market on the moon."

ChatGPT will choose to search the web based on what you ask, or you can manually choose to search by clicking the new web search icon.
Responses have both in-line and sidebar attribution to news publishers and other data sources OpenAI has licensing deals with. For example, a search for weekend events in San Francisco might pull up a summary sourced from local news websites, while a follow-up question about restaurant suggestions will show a list of local options.
Election results-related queries will be directed to sources like AP and Reuters, OpenAI says.
ChatGPT Plus and Team users will get access to ChatGPT Search on mobile and the web to start, while OpenAI’s enterprise and educational customers will get ChatGPT Search in the coming weeks, followed by free users.
OpenAI has also released a browser extension to make ChatGPT Search the default search engine in Chrome.
OpenAI says that it plans to keep improving search, particularly in areas like shopping and travel, and leverage its o1 “reasoning” models for “deeper research.” The company’s also planning to bring ChatGPT Search to its Advanced Voice Mode feature, as well as to logged-out users of ChatGPT.
Some publishers have protested AI-generated overviews like ChatGPT Search and Google’s AI Overviews, saying that they threaten to cannibalize traffic to the sites from which they source their information. One study found that AI Overviews could negatively affect about 25% of publisher traffic due to the de-emphasis on article links.
OpenAI says it incorporated feedback from publisher partners about how ChatGPT Search decides which articles are most relevant to a query, as well as determining the summary length and quotations for articles."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/google-maps-is-getting-new-ai-features-powered-by-gemini/,Google Maps is getting new AI features powered by Gemini | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-31,"Google Maps is getting new features powered by Gemini, Google’s generative AI model. On Thursday the company announced incoming updates that will allow Google Maps users in the U.S. to tap into AI to help them find new places to visit and answer questions about different locations.
The platform is also getting enhanced navigation features to help motorists get to their destination by highlighting things like which lane you’re supposed to be in.
By bringing Gemini into Maps, Google will be looking to ensure that its navigation app is better poised to compete with Apple Maps and navigation startups.
In other updates, Google Maps will allow users to get ideas for places to go and things to do simply by asking the service. For instance, if you have a friend visiting you, you can ask Maps for “things to do with friends at night.” Gemini will then serve up a curated list of options, such as checking out a speakeasy or live music.
To learn more about the places that Gemini recommends, users can read a quick summary of what people have thought about the place. If you have a specific follow-up question, say if it has outdoor seating, you can also ask Gemini.
These new capabilities are rolling out in the United States on Android and iOS this week. Google said it plans to bring similar experiences to Search, including AI-powered review summaries and the option to ask questions about places.
As for the new navigation features, Google is making it easier for Maps users to drive in unfamiliar areas with multiple lanes, forks, and exits. Google Maps will now display lanes, crosswalks, and road signs clearly on the map. Plus, it will show exactly which lane you should be in so you don’t have to merge at the last second.
The update will also make it easier to explore stuff to do along your route before you start driving. Once you enter your destination, Google Maps will display top landmarks, attractions, scenic spots, and dining options.
Then, once you get to your destination, Google Maps will show you nearby parking lots. After you park, the app will remind you to save your parking space so you don’t forget where you left your car. You can also get walking directions from your car to the entrance of your destination, with the option to launch Street View or AR (augmented reality) walking navigation.
In addition, Google Maps will allow users to see and report weather disruptions on the road, such as flooded, unplowed, and low-visibility areas.
Google also announced that Google Maps’ Immersive View feature, which creates a 3D model of a destination, is expanding to 150 cities globally. As part of the expansion, the feature will launch in Brussels, Kyoto, and Frankfurt, among other new locations.
As part of today’s announcement Google revealed that it’s bringing Gemini to Waze, its other navigation app. The company has started testing a feature that will allow users to report traffic incidents using their voice.  For instance, you can tap the reporting button and speak naturally and say something like: “Looks like there are cars jammed up ahead.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/googles-gemini-api-and-ai-studio-get-grounding-with-google-search/,Google's Gemini API and AI Studio get grounding with Google Search | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-10-31,"Starting today, developers using Google’s Gemini API and its Google AI Studio to build AI-based services and bots will be able to ground their prompts’ results with data from Google Search. This should enable more accurate responses based on fresher data.
As has been the case before, developers will be able to try out grounding for free in AI Studio, which is essentially Google’s playground for developers to test and refine their prompts, and to access its latest large language models (LLMs). Gemini API users will have to be on the paid tier and will pay $35 per 1,000 grounded queries.
AI Studio’s recently launched built-in compare mode makes it easy to see how the results of grounded queries differ from those that rely solely on the model’s own data.
At its core, grounding connects a model with verifiable data — whether that’s a company’s internal data or, in this case, Google’s entire search catalog. This also helps the system avoid hallucinations. In an example Google showed me ahead of today’s launch, a prompt asking who won the Emmy for best comedy series in 2024, the model — without grounding — said it was “Ted Lasso.” But that was a hallucination. “Ted Lasso” won the award, but in 2022. With grounding on, the model provided the correct result (“Hacks”), included additional context, and cited its sources.
Turning on grounding is as easy as toggling on a switch and deciding on how often the API should use grounding by making changes to the “dynamic retrieval” setting. That could be as straightforward as opting to turn it on for every prompt or going with a more nuanced setting that then uses a smaller model to evaluate the prompt and decide whether it would benefit from being augmented with data from Google Search.
“Grounding can help … when you ask a very recent question that’s beyond the model’s knowledge cutoff, but it could also help with a question which is not as recent … but you may want richer detail,” Shrestha Basu Mallick, Google’s group product manager for the Gemini API and AI Studio, explained. “There might be developers who say we only want to ground on recent facts, and they would set this [dynamic retrieval value] higher. And there might be developers who say: No, I want the rich detail of Google search on everything.”
When Google enriches results with data from Google Search, it also provides supporting links back to the underlying sources. Logan Kilpatrick, who joined Google earlier this year after previously leading developer relations at OpenAI, told me that displaying these links is a requirement of the Gemini license for anyone who uses this feature.
“It is very important for us for two reasons: one, we want to make sure our publishers get the credit and the visibility,” Basu Mallick added. “But second, this also is something that users like. When I get an LLM answer, I often go to Google Search and check that answer. We’re providing a way for them to do this easily, so this is much valued by users.”
In this context, it’s worth noting that while AI Studio started out as something more akin to a prompt tuning tool, it’s a lot more now.
“Success for AI Studio looks like: you come in, you try one of the Gemini models, and you see this actually is really powerful and works well for your use case,” said Kilpatrick. “There’s a bunch we do to surface potential interesting use cases to developers front and center in the UI, but ultimately, the goal is not to keep you in AI Studio and just have you sort of play around with the models. The goal is to get you code. You press ‘Get Code’ in the top right-hand corner, you go start building something, and you might come back to AI Studio to experiment with a future model.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/how-to-court-and-retain-gen-z-workers/,How to court — and retain — Gen Z workers | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-10-31,"It’s the topic on everyone’s mind: Are Gen Z workers actually different?
TechCrunch sought to find out at this year’s Disrupt 2024. We sat down with SignalFire’s Heather Doshay, Comprehensive.io’s Roger Lee, and CapitalG’s Lauren Illovsky to chat about how to hire and retain talent. One topic that came up was how younger workers are much different than their older counterparts.
“It was the same with millennials, right?” Illovsky asked onstage. “We remember when boomers criticized millennials, and now millennials were criticizing Gen Z. I love Gen Z, too. I think there’s an appreciation for how much they push the boundaries and force you to think.”
She said employers can either be grouchy about it or try to see the world from a different perspective and how it affects what Gen Z can bring to the table. Doshay noted that this generation has been in the workforce for at least five years, meaning they’ve faced a labor market affected by the pandemic, economic uncertainty, and mass layoffs in tech.
“So there’s a lack of loyalty amongst Gen Z in the workforce that we’re seeing in early data,” Doshay said, citing that a report by her company found that Gen Zers stay in a job for an average of 1.1 years, compared to the older generations that spent decades at a company. “That challenges you to do better,” she said. “What can you do to retain these folks and keep them there longer?”
At the same time, she said, it’s still early. Gen Z’s behavior might evolve over time as the workforce changes with them. “I think it’s really important to have that perspective in your workforce and have a really diverse set of people,” she said. “If your consumer base reflects Gen Z, you want to make sure that you have that DNA in your workforce.”
Lee said that Gen Zers value transparency a lot more than other generations. Today, young people talk openly about their salaries and will post TikToks of themselves being fired. Lee said that companies should find ways to be more transparent with their employees, which can make them stand out from the companies that aren’t.
Of course, we had to ask about that now-viral video of Keith Rabois talking about not hiring someone over 30 years old. Without naming names, we spoke about the concept of ageism and how it actually hurts companies. Illovsky said that companies need to have a workforce that is diverse in age, which results in a diverse skill set. Doshay said that older generations tend to be more engaged in the workforce, and reminded the audience that it’s illegal to discriminate based on age. In fact, not hiring anyone over 30 probably meant most of the audience wouldn’t hire themselves, she said.
“Also, since when was 30 the cutoff?” Lee added jokingly. “I’m a little insulted by that.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/whatsapp-users-can-now-filter-chats-with-customized-lists/,WhatsApp users can now filter chats with customized lists | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-10-31,"WhatsApp is making it easier to organize the many messages filling up your inbox. The messaging app announced Thursday that it’s adding the ability to filter chats into customizable categories. This will help you keep track of conversations with family members, work colleagues, college friends, and more.
The “Custom Lists” feature is an enhancement to the chat filters that WhatsApp introduced back in April. Previously, you only had access to three filters: “All,” “Unread,” and “Groups.” With the new update, you can now create lists of your own, letting you focus on your favorite chats at once.
To create a list, tap the plus sign (+) in the filter bar at the top of the Chats tab and give the list a name. You can then add anyone you want to the list, including both groups and one-on-one chats. As you add more lists, you’ll be able to swipe on the screen to navigate through the filters. Additionally, you can edit a list by long-pressing it and choosing to add or remove people or groups.
By default, WhatsApp will still open to the “All” category, which displays all messages in chronological order.
Custom Lists is rolling out today and will become available to everyone in the following weeks."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/college-social-app-fizzs-serial-failed-retiree-ceo-steps-down-as-founder-takes-helm/,College social app Fizz’s ‘serial failed retiree’ CEO steps down as founder takes helm | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-10-31,"Veteran entrepreneur Rakesh Mathur stepped down as CEO of the college social network Fizz, handing over the reins to 22-year-old founder Teddy Solomon.
It’s full circle for Fizz, the anonymous platform that Solomon started with his Stanford classmate Ashton Cofer before they dropped out to work on the app full-time. Mathur has been working with the young founders since late 2021, when his daughter — also a Stanford student — met Solomon at a party and proclaimed to her father that she had met “the next Mark Zuckerberg.”
Maybe Mathur’s daughter has a future career in early-stage investing because she was on to something. Fizz isn’t Facebook, and thankfully, Solomon has not yet had to testify for his company’s shortcomings on Capitol Hill. But three years later, he has made a name for himself. Fizz has raised over $40 million and spread to 250 college campuses, where students have posted on the platform about 20 million times.
“From my standpoint, I get to the stage that I find somebody who can do a better job than I can, that has the right level of passion, and then I step back and I’m a chairman, a mentor,” Mathur told TechCrunch.
Mathur decided that Solomon was ready to take the reins of the company because of how much the company had gone through in such a short time period.
“We raised money in the end of 2021, and everything was easy; 2022 was a disaster to raise money in,” Mathur said. “So he lived through that. That normally takes a whole cycle — six, seven years to go through an upturn and a downturn.”
Fizz has also faced the pressure that will plague any social media platform when it gains enough traction — what if people use the platform irresponsibly?
The company got into hot water last year when students at a high school in Vermont abused the platform, which turned into a hotbed for bullying. Rather than doubling down on its plans to expand to high schools, Fizz made the choice to stop catering to these younger users, who are less likely to use the anonymous platform responsibly. But at this point, some of the turbulence has settled for the company, which still has about $20 million in funding in the bank.
“The time to do something like this is when you have as much momentum as you could possibly have, and we have unbelievable momentum right now,” Solomon told TechCrunch. “We’re seeing the quickest expansion we’ve ever had, and we’re seeing just the morale in the company and around the app and the excitement around what we’re building higher than ever.”
Fizz has recently started showing advertisements on the app in an attempt to drive some revenue, working with companies like Perplexity. But now Solomon has to learn how to run ads in a way that doesn’t detract from user experience.
“We have a waitlist of companies who are trying to do advertising with us, and we’re taking it very slowly, learning as much as we can,” Solomon said. “I walk around Stanford’s campus and I see DoorDash ambassadors all around campus and companies that are really trying to reach college users, and what we can offer them is they’re all on our platform.”
For Mathur, stepping down as CEO means that he can get back to his retirement.
“I’m as much a serial failed retiree as I am a serial entrepreneur,” he said. But the intergenerational bond that the two entrepreneurs have formed isn’t going away. The two spend so much time together socially — Mathur even took Solomon on a trip across India — that his daughter, the Stanford student who first introduced them, had to warn him that he’s not allowed to go to Stanford parties.
“My friends at Stanford love Rakesh, you have no idea,” Solomon said. But Mathur doesn’t need to relive his youth — he just wants to get the coveted invite to Solomon’s weekly pancake breakfast with his Stanford friends, which takes place every Friday at 6 a.m.
“Rakesh gets mad because he says I don’t invite him to pancakes anymore,” Solomon said. “That’s not true. My friends graduated, Rakesh.”
“Part of this transition was that I would get invited to pancakes,” Mathur joked. “That was the final step … I’ve got the pancake invite locked and loaded.”
Solomon learned how to run a startup, raise capital, and manage a team from Mathur. But what he values most from Mathur’s mentorship is his knack for keeping a stressful startup environment energizing.
“What Rakesh taught me most was how to have fun while you’re doing it, because Rakesh has never stopped having fun to this day, after a dozen companies and all he’s done in his career,” Solomon said. “He has an eerily similar energy to me, given how many years apart we are, but we both just love to love what we’re doing, and want to continue loving what we’re doing.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/nvidia-runai-deal-to-be-reviewed-under-eus-merger-rules/,Nvidia-Run:ai deal to be reviewed under EU's merger rules | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-31,"The European Union has tossed a wrench in the works of chipmaker Nvidia’s proposed acquisition of Tel Aviv-based AI workload management startup Run:ai. The deal, which was announced back in April — with a price tag of $700 million per our sources — will be reviewed by the bloc after a request by competition regulators in Italy under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR).
Nvidia cannot implement the transaction before notifying and obtaining clearance from the Commission. So, at a minimum, the referral may add a few weeks to its timeline for completing the deal. However, if the EU’s preliminary check identifies specific issues of concern, the bloc may move to a deeper investigation — which could add months of delay and uncertainty.
The proposed transaction does not meet the EUMR’s standard notification thresholds. However, EU law allows a national regulator to notify a transaction to the Commission if it believes it poses serious risks for competition locally and which could affect trade within the bloc’s Single Market.
“Italy submitted a referral request to the Commission pursuant to Article 22(1) of the EUMR. This provision allows Member States to request the Commission to examine a merger that does not have an EU dimension but affects trade within the Single Market and threatens to significantly affect competition within the territory of the Member State(s) making the request,” the Commission wrote in a press release Thursday.
The EU’s acceptance of the referral means it agrees the proposed transaction meets the criteria for referral under Article 22.
“In particular, the transaction threatens to significantly affect competition in the markets where NVIDIA and Run:ai are active, which are likely to be at least European Economic Area-wide and therefore include the referring country Italy,” the EU wrote. “The Commission also concluded that it is best placed to examine the transaction given its knowledge and case experience in related markets.”
The Commission has now asked Nvidia to notify the transaction — a formal step that means the chipmaker must prepare documentation to inform the bloc’s competition enforcers of the details of the proposed merger so they can assess impacts.
While Big Tech enjoyed many years of minimal oversight of its (killer) acquisitions of startups and smaller rivals, there has been a change of approach over the last few years as regulators recognized the anti-competitive legacy of sitting on their hands for so long while a few platform giants gobbled up market power.
With AI, the rapidly developing software field where innovation is dependent upon access to a small number of key inputs — such as the graphics processing units, or GPUs, that Nvidia has geared toward training AI models — the specter of a rapid repeat of the market concentration issue has encouraged swifter vigilance from antitrust enforcers.
Though, as yet, no harder action has been taken. So it will certainly be interesting to see what the Commission’s review concludes here.
Nvidia spokesman John Rizzo emailed a statement responding to the EU’s merger review. “We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about Run:ai,” the company wrote. “After the acquisition closes, we’ll continue to make AI available in every cloud and enterprise, and help customers select any system and software solution that works best for them.”
This report was updated with comment from Nvidia."

Anthropic is launching Claude apps for Mac and Windows today in public beta, which — as Anthropic writes in a blog post — “brings Claude’s capabilities directly to your preferred work environment.” These capabilities, to be clear, don’t include Anthropic’s recently announced Computer Use feature, which allows the company’s newest flagship model, an upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to perform tasks on your PC.
The desktop apps are available both for free Claude users and users subscribed to Anthropic’s premium plans.
Anthropic also released a dictation tool for Claude. However, this feature is currently not available in the new desktop apps. On iOS, Android, and iPadOS, users can record and upload a message up to 10 minutes in length to have Claude transcribe and respond to it. Note this isn’t a real-time conversation mode; dictation is more akin to sending a voice message.
The new features arrive as Anthropic is reportedly raising billions of dollars at an over $40 billion valuation. It has a vested interest, it goes without saying, in making Claude competitive with rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/space-ceos-talk-about-the-challenges-and-opportunities-of-selling-defense-tech/,Space CEOs talk about the challenges and opportunities of selling defense tech | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-31,"Space executives took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt on Monday to talk about the challenges and opportunities of building out dual-use technology, or tech that has both a defense and a commercial use case.
The dual-use strategy can be tricky for young startups to manage, however, because they run the risk of diluting their focus by trying to sell to both the Department of Defense (DOD) and commercial companies, True Anomaly CEO Even Rogers warned. True Anomaly, which is developing software and hardware to enable mobile satellite operations, “is not a space company,” he said. “We’re a defense company.”
But staying focused can get challenging for startups if their investors are not fully aligned with their mission, he said. “When investors start to push the dual-use thesis … it can dilute the focus, particularly at an early stage, and it just requires very open and honest conversations with investors and a very careful selection of who’s around the table,” he said.
With the rapid industrialization of space, however, there are more commercial opportunities emerging for startups.
“There are no clear bright lines between commercial and government in space,” Slingshot Aerospace CEO Tim Solms said. “Dual use is upon us. … There are no defense-only or commercial-only operations out there right now. There is a lot of blend in there, so you have to be able to navigate both.”
Both agreed that the term “dual use” is “idiosyncratic,” as Rogers put it, especially now that space is a strongly contested domain.
For startups that are looking to sell to the government, there’s been a huge effort inside the DOD to work with small businesses and procure technologies outside the traditional defense and aerospace primes. As Debra Emmons, CTO of The Aerospace Corporation, said onstage, the government has stood up the Defense Innovation Unit, the Office of Strategic Capital, and other funding mechanisms to bring private and public money together.
Many of these programs are to assist companies at the early stage, however, so a dual-use strategy could be a hedge against the government’s relative slowness to sign on new companies to programs of record.
“I do think we are looking at a place where we need to really bring in more on those later stages,” Emmons said.
But startups that want to work with the government need to understand that there will be additional hurdles to jump and more relationship-building and trust that need to be established. The relationship-building is especially important; to some extent, the defense tech winners will be those companies that can navigate government most effectively, not necessarily those that have the best technology.
“The tech is table stakes,” Rogers said. “The talent is table stakes. What you have to master is a go-to-market strategy that starts with operational advocacy, clarity about the operational requirements.”
Solms agreed: “Number one, focus on the mission, understand the mission. Don’t come to a point solution. You’re not trying to solve a thing; you’re trying to support a mission.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/mealme-startup-integrating-food-ordering-tech-into-app-picks-up-8m/,"MealMe, the startup integrating food ordering tech into apps, picks up $8M | TechCrunch",Lauren Forristal,2024-10-31,"MealMe, a unified API that embeds food and retail ordering into consumer apps and websites, announced on Thursday that it secured $8 million in Series A funding. The newly raised capital brings the total amount raised to $16 million.
Since its launch in 2019, MealMe has undergone several changes. Initially, it was a consumer app designed to help people find the best deals on delivery from restaurants and grocery stores. It then evolved to allow consumers to order food directly through the MealMe app.
The company has now completely transitioned to a B2B model, offering its API for other businesses to integrate ordering technology into their applications and websites. When a company integrates MealMe’s API, it gets access to real-time product pricing and availability, and it enables customers to order their products from local stores.
MealMe says that its API provides inventory data on more than 1 billion products from more than 1.2 million grocery stores, restaurants, and retailers across the U.S. and Canada. It currently serves more than 100 customers, including Fantuan Delivery, Favor Delivery, Tripadvisor, and others.
Matthew Bouchner, MealMe co-founder and president, told TechCrunch, “We built the API for ourselves with the consumer app to add ordering from stores into our app, and then realized that, OK, well, we can continue growing our app, or we can pivot to B2B and be the infrastructure layer for anybody that needs the ability to pull menus and inventory and send orders into stores.”
Bouchner added that the company made the pivot after seeing the growing trend of embedded commerce, which essentially involves integrating e-commerce features into existing platforms. This allows businesses to offer their products directly to customers through platforms they already use.
“Everything is going to be embedded. You’re going to be able to order from your car, from your TV, from your existing social networking apps, with your AI-based assistant, and there needs to be an infrastructure layer that connects that consumer-facing platform to stores and to marketplaces … I think that we are going to be at the forefront of everything embedded for years to come,” he said.
The Series A was led by Mercury Fund with participation from existing investors Gaingels and Palm Drive Capital.
The company will use the new capital to strengthen marketing efforts and grow the team to deliver better developer support to enterprise customers. In addition to food ordering and delivery, the company aims to focus on expanding into other areas, such as broader e-commerce and AI."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/d-id-launches-new-high-quality-avatars-capable-of-real-time-conversations/,D-ID launches new high-quality avatars capable of real-time conversations | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-31,"AI video platform D-ID announced today that it is releasing two new types of avatars — Express and Premium+ — for content creation.
Companies are chasing the golden goose of creating AI avatars that are more humanlike and can potentially offload video creation for enterprise use cases in areas like marketing, sales, and customer support. With different generative models, it is easier to give little text input and little visual data to create videos for business purposes that don’t look entirely out of place. D-ID’s new models are an effort to make it more competitive in this landscape.
Express avatars can be trained with roughly one minute of video and can replicate users’ head movements during speech. Premium+ is the company’s marquee model, which might need at least a few minutes of recording for training but can reproduce an AI avatar for videos with hands and torso. The company’s idea is that with hands and torso movements, the avatar feels more human-like in interaction with other users.
The company said that the Premium+ models are capable of real-time interaction that might be good for use cases like webinar and translation.
The company plans to engage these avatars for enterprise use cases such as creating sales leads, customer engagement, and personalized marketing campaigns.
“We believe the best way to interact with AI models is face-to-face; that is why we are creating these new hyper-realistic avatars and a natural user interface,” D-ID CEO Gil Perry told TechCrunch over a call.
“We also think businesspeople would create a digital avatar of themselves. We want those avatars to be safe and built in a secure way so this tech is not used to mislead anyone.”
D-ID said that personalized video campaigns are more effective, causing click-through rates to increase by 30% and conversion rates to increase by 35%.
Along with the new avatar, the company is launching its enterprise marketing suite as well with tools such as interactive avatars and AI influencers for brands, video campaign generation, translation support in 30 languages, integration with platforms like Canva and PowerPoint, and an API-led integration with CRMs and marketing automation tools.
Last year, D-ID launched an app that lets users create videos from a single photograph. While the company’s new avatars are limited to its desktop studio tools for now, it plans to expand this tech to the mobile app."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/buddy-ai-is-using-ai-and-gaming-to-help-children-learn-english-as-a-second-language/,Buddy.ai is using AI and gaming to help children learn English as a second language | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-10-31,"In 2014, Ivan Crewkov moved his family from Siberia to the U.S. as his startup, Cubic.AI, was preparing to launch a Kickstarter campaign for its smart speaker. A week before the campaign was supposed to go live, Amazon launched its Echo smart speaker, rendering Cubic.AI essentially dead in the water.
“It was a disaster,” Crewkov told TechCrunch. “It made zero sense to compete with Amazon and Google; we ended up selling the company [two years later].”
But the experience wasn’t a total loss. Moving his family from Siberia to the U.S. meant putting his daughters, used to speaking Russian at home, into English-speaking schools. His eldest daughter started working with an online tutor, and when Crewkov realized that the tutor was reading scripted answers, the idea behind his next and current startup, Buddy.ai, was born.
“I just realized that we could probably create an AI character that would do the same things if lessons are scripted,” Crewkov said. “My daughter struggled; she was our first tester and our first user.”
Buddy.ai is an animated, multimodal, conversational character tutor meant to help children learn English as a second language. The company works as a subscription app that consumers can download. The company has also started working with schools in countries like Brazil as well.
Crewkov said that despite their background working in voice-based AI, it was challenging to get the business off the ground. When they started, they thought they would be able to get the product to market within six months, a goal Crewkov now refers to as “naive.” Instead, it took years.
Because the product is aimed at children, the company had to navigate the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) and similar laws in other countries. Plus, it’s a tough problem to crack. The AI had to be trained not just to understand human voice but to also understand children’s voices speaking in languages they didn’t fully know yet.
“We are trying to understand a 4-year-old Brazilian girl who is trying to say her first words in English at the same time as a 4-year-old Arabic girl from Saudi Arabia,” Crewkov said. “Completely different accents and completely different languages. We just started collecting data in countries [where] there were no hardcore [regulations] like COPPA and trained the first model on that data.”
But the company prevailed, and now seven years later it is approaching 55 million downloads and works with more than 22 million students annually.
Buddy.ai just raised an $11 million seed round led by BITKRAFT Ventures with participation from One Way Ventures, J Ventures, and Point72 Ventures, among others.
Crewkov said that fundraising for Buddy.ai was tough from the beginning, and despite the rise of interest in AI, this round was still a slog. He said they spoke to 186 investors to close this seed round. BITKRAFT just happened to be the second firm they spoke to, and Crewkov said that they were the perfect fit for what his company was doing.
“We were specifically interested in finding a fund with expertise in the gaming field and that’s why we are so in love with BITKRAFT,” Crewkov said. “Children treat Buddy as a game. A fun fact is most of the downloads are actually made by children who just want to play with buddy.”
The company plans to invest all of the capital into product development. Crewkov said that despite the company’s age and traction, thus far he considers the tech to be pretty underdeveloped. Buddy.ai plans to hire a head of game design and a head of UX design with this latest round.
Crewkov added that a big push for the company is to add on more languages and continue to build out its relationships with schools.
Buddy.ai is not the only company looking to use AI characters to help people practice a new language. Univerbal is another that has raised $2 million in venture capital. Loora has raised $21.3 million. Buddy.ai’s approach of focusing on children learning English as a second language helps it stand out.
“We just believe that the future is hybrid where AI tutors and AI agents can really help teachers,” Crewkov said. “You just need to provide a lot of practice, practice daily. We will never [have] enough teachers to do that; it’s the prefect applications to AI.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/noma-is-building-tools-to-spot-security-issues-with-ai-apps/,Noma is building tools to spot security issues with AI apps | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-31,"Companies are concerned that their eagerness to adopt AI has made them more vulnerable to cyberthreats. Per a recent poll of over 350 IT leaders, more than half of the executives surveyed said the complexity of AI applications weakened their organization’s cybersecurity posture. More than two-fifths of executives believe their security teams lack the skills needed to protect their AI applications and workloads, per another survey.
The demand for solutions to secure AI apps has spawned an entire cohort of startups. HiddenLayer and Protect AI, for example, focus on defending AI systems from adversarial attacks, while Cranium provides visibility into AI systems at the application level.
A new venture emerging from stealth today, Noma Security, does all of this and more, claims co-founder and CEO Niv Braun. The startup is developing tools to identify vulnerable data pipelines and code in data science environments, as well as threats like prompt injection attacks.
Braun launched Noma with Alon Tron after leaving customer experience automation firm Verint, where he noticed a “significant blind spot” for security teams in the data and AI lifecycle.
“Existing tools are designed for the traditional software lifecycle,” Braun said. “However, the data and AI lifecycle is inherently different. It involves distinct R&D processes, relies on different technologies, and faces unique technical vulnerabilities within AI models.”
Noma is designed to help spot — and fix — misconfigurations in the components used to develop and run AI applications. For instance, the platform scans for “sensitive” data in model training datasets, such as text containing personally identifiable information.
Braun argues that companies can be better equipped to deal with threats if they can consolidate AI app security functions in one dashboard that can be deployed in cloud-based and self-hosted environments.
“Many single-function security solutions are flooding the market, trying to capitalize on the AI hype,” he said. “By helping companies understand their AI application footprint and giving them governance controls, Noma is not only helping organizations minimize and mitigate risk, but also giving them the confidence they need to expand their AI usage faster and to more high-value parts of the business.”
Noma, founded in 2023, already has paying customers, Braun says, including Fortune 500 clients in B2B software, financial services, and retail. The startup recently closed a $25 million Series A funding round that Braun said was preempted by investors; Noma had cash to spare.
“We decided to accept the [$25 million], even with substantial funds still in the bank, to accelerate our development and especially our go-to-market teams and efforts,” he said, adding that Noma plans to double the size of its 20-person team in the coming year.
Ballistic Ventures led Noma’s Series A, which brings the company’s total capital raised to $32 million. Noma raised $7 million in a previously undisclosed seed round led by Glilot Capital Partners with participation from Cyber Club London.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/temus-low-cost-marketplace-faces-formal-probe-in-eu-over-raft-of-dsa-compliance-concerns/,Temu's low-cost marketplace faces formal probe in EU over raft of DSA compliance concerns | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-31,"The European Union has expanded its scrutiny of online marketplaces by opening a formal proceeding on Chinese low-cost e-commerce platform, Temu, under the Digital Services Act (DSA), the Commission announced Thursday.
Enforcers of the online governance framework will now dial up their oversight of Temu. The bloc’s suspicions are focused on concerns about the sale of illegal products, which may include things like toys and cosmetics that could harm consumers by not complying with EU standards; addictive design related to how the marketplace seeks to gamify shoppers’ engagement; the transparency of Temu’s recommender systems, including the lack of a non-profiling-based option for users; and issues with obligations related to researcher access to public data.
If the Commission confirms any breaches of the DSA, Temu’s parent, Pinduoduo, could face fines of up to 6% of its annual global turnover.
The EU only designated Temu as subject to the DSA’s strictest set of rules — which apply transparency requirements on larger platforms as well as requiring they assess and mitigate systemic risks — back in May, with compliance for those rules expected from this month, so the bloc’s enforcers are moving quickly.
They’ve previously said online marketplace safety is one of their core priorities for DSA enforcement, opening an earlier investigation of the e-commerce giant AliXpress this spring (which remains ongoing).
In a briefing with journalists ahead of the formal proceeding being made public, Commission officials said the swiftly opened investigation on Temu reflects both how rapidly the marketplace has grown in the region (it launched only last year), and how many concerns have been shared by others, including consumer protection agencies and Member State-level Digital Services Coordinators (DSCs), which enforce the DSA’s general rules.
The Commission noted this is the first time it’s building an investigatory case on the basis of data provided by DSCs, who have had an oversight role on Temu since mid-February. DSCs in Ireland and Germany are among those that have provided to the EU data on Temu.
Customs authorities and market surveillance bodies have also raised concerns, the Commission says.
Back in May, consumer protections from around the EU grabbed headlines after lodging a series of coordinated complaints against Temu, accusing the company of breaching the DSA’s general rules. Since then the EU has taken over oversight of Temu after it was confirmed as a so-called very large online platform.
Temu’s assessment and mitigation of systemic risks is one of the areas the Commission will now investigate.
Officials told journalists they are concerned Temu’s risk assessment document — which the company shared with the EU at the end of September — was “far too generic.”
The bloc said it’s worried about illegal products quickly reappearing on the platform after being taken down and “rogue traders” also respawning. But it wants to do more systemic checks to find out how extensive a problem this might be.
The Commission’s concerns on addictive design relate to DSA obligations on platforms to prevent negative impacts on users’ mental well-being. Temu’s system of gamified reward programs and features like indefinite scrolling merit closer assessment, officials said.
The researcher access issue relates to public data that Temu should be making available (such as through APIs) so that independent researchers can study things like its rates of take downs of non-compliant products.
While the bloc had already sent Temu a couple of requests for information regarding its DSA compliance — including in relation to illegal products — the Commission’s formal proceeding unlocks more enforcement powers, meaning the EU will be able to deepen its investigation.
Officials stressed that while they have reason to suspect Temu could be non-compliant they need to gather more data to confirm whether or not there has been a breach.
The EU also points out that DSA investigations may be closed if a platform offers commitments that assuage concerns. And the bloc remains keen for the regulation to be seen moving the needle on priority safety issues — hence the Commission accepting binding commitments from TikTok to resolve concerns around addictive design of the TikTok Lite app earlier this year.
In a statement responding to the DSA investigation, Temu wrote: “Temu takes its obligations under the DSA seriously, continuously investing to strengthen our compliance system and safeguard consumer interests on our platform. We will cooperate fully with regulators to support our shared goal of a safe, trusted marketplace for consumers.”
The company also noted that it is in discussions to join the Commission’s Memorandum of Understanding on the sale of counterfeit goods on the internet — a voluntary effort to boost efforts to combat the sale of counterfeit goods online.
“Counterfeiting is an industrywide challenge, and we believe that collaborative efforts are essential to advancing our shared goals of protecting consumers and rights holders,” Temu added.
Responding to the Commission’s DSA proceeding announcement in a statement, Fernando Hortal Foronda, digital policy officer at the European Consumer Organisation, welcomed the development: “There are many problems consumer groups have identified with Temu, which include many dangerous or illegal products on sale or the frequent use of design techniques to trick consumers.
“This decision by the Commission is a promising step, but only the first. Now, it’s important the Commission keeps up the pressure on Temu and pushes the company to comply with the law as soon as possible. It is neither fair to consumers, nor to the many businesses that do comply, that certain companies such as Temu get away with flouting the law.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/2024-looks-set-to-be-another-record-breaking-year-for-ransomware-and-its-likely-going-to-get-worse/,2024 looks set to be another record-breaking year for ransomware — and it's likely going to get worse | TechCrunch,Carly Page,2024-10-31,"The ransomware industry is thriving, not losing.
Despite various law enforcement wins against ransomware actors, like the sweeping takedown of LockBit and the seizure of Radar, hackers continue to reap the rewards of these data-theft attacks — and 2024 looks set to be their most profitable year to date.
That’s according to Allan Liska, a ransomware expert who serves as a threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. In an interview with TechCrunch in London earlier this month, Liska confirmed that 2024 is on track to be another record-breaking year for ransomware — with equally record-breaking ransoms paid by victims to hackers.
“The curve is going to flatten a little bit, which I guess is good news. But a record-breaking year is still a record-breaking year,” Liska told TechCrunch. “We’ve also this year, for the first time that I’m aware of, had four eight-figure ransoms paid.”
One of these eight-figure sums was the $22 million ransom that Change Healthcare paid to the Russian cybercrime gang ALPHV following the theft of highly sensitive medical data related to hundreds of millions of Americans. What followed, Liska said, was rampant in-fighting between the ransomware group and its affiliate, which carried out the hack on ALPHV’s behalf.
“If you wanted a reality show, this was it,” said Liska.
This apparent scrappiness is only likely to worsen as younger threat actors join the ransomware foray, as we’ve seen with highly skilled and financially motivated hackers like Lapsus$ and, more recently, Scattered Spider. This loose-knit group of predominantly teenage, native English-speaking hackers has carried out some of the most disastrous cyberattacks in history, such as the breach of MGM Hotels and the suspected links to the recent cyberattack on Transport for London.
The disjointed nature of these attackers is evidenced by the increase of data theft-only attacks, which have increased by more than 30% in 2024, according to Liska. “That is up significantly from just a couple of years ago,” he told TechCrunch. “A lot of the newer threat actors just don’t want to deal with encryption, decryption, or anything like that,” referring to attacks that exfiltrate huge amounts of stolen data.
While the persistence of teenage hackers has already led to a rise in extortion-only attacks, that might be just the tip of the iceberg. Liska warns that these scrappy threat actors could choose to skip data theft entirely and decide to steal money directly from cryptocurrency exchanges instead. Worse, Liska warns that the fight against ransomware can spill into real-world violence, describing escalatory extortion tactics by groups like Scattered Spider, which use real-world information against their targets if their victims say they won’t pay a ransom.
The outcome of the upcoming U.S. election could also have a major effect on the future of ransomware.
Liska notes that the global ransomware taskforce set up under the Biden administration has been a “huge benefit” to the fight against hackers, thanks to an increase in the sharing of intelligence between nations. Liska said that there is “a good chance that goes away” if the U.S. no longer shares intelligence with its allies under a successive Trump administration, which has promised wide-scale government deregulation.
“I don’t think that’s something we’re prepared for — and we could see even more of an acceleration of ransomware attacks if law enforcement is less able to do their job,” said Liska.
Under the previous Trump administration, “we saw WannaCry and NotPetya, and there was no immediate response,” said Liska
What’s the solution? According to Liska, who said at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 that banning ransomware payments wasn’t the answer, doing so is now the only solution.
“We’ve had 20-plus law enforcement actions just this year against ransomware, and that is fantastic. But if we’re going to feed eight-figure ransom payments to these attackers then that changes the incentive model. You might get arrested, but on the other hand, you might get an eight-figure ransom payment, that’s a challenge that is hard to resist.”
“My answer is: ban ransom payments, which is a terrible solution, but it may be the least-bad solution that we have,” Liska added."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/nfl-quarterback-turned-founder-colin-kaepernick-on-the-challenges-facing-disrupters/,NFL quarterback turned-founder Colin Kaepernick on the challenges facing disrupters | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-31,"Former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 on Wednesday to talk about the challenges facing people who want to disrupt something — both inside and outside of the tech world.
“One of the biggest challenges that you will likely face when you try to disrupt something — or you try to do something you’re passionate about, and it ends up disrupting something in that process, is you face a lot of resistance,” Kaepernick said. “There will be difficult times, and during those times, you want to have those people that you can lean on, the people that can support you, and that’s really what gives you that endurance.”
Kaepernick is no stranger to disrupting the status quo, as he made national headlines in 2016 when he took a knee to protest racial injustice. The former NFL star says that while he faced a lot of resistance, he also saw a push to create a better and more equitable future.
“When you do that and you see such a strong response to it, it really gives you perspective and insight,” Kaepernick said. “We have such a long way to go. But, the other part that I learned during that time period, there are also a lot of people that want to go that long way with you, and I think that has been the beautiful part coming out of that is while there has been resistance to it, there’s also been a lot of organizing.”
As someone who has had thousands of stories written about him, he now wants to help creators take control of their narratives with Lumi. The startup is aiming to empower creators by helping them independently create and publish stories and content.
As for founders who are looking to disrupt and explore their passions, Kaepernick offered a few words of advice.
“Do your homework and know why you’re doing what you’re doing,” he said. “And then two, once you know that, go after it passionately and go after it with everything that you have and bring people with you. I would not be sitting here today and none of you would know me at all if there weren’t a whole lot of people that helped me along the way, and that’s everyone from my wife to family and friends to teammates to coaches, some of the investors and advisors that I’ve had along the way. So have those people with you, because that makes us, that makes you sustainable for the long run.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/aurora-innovation-delays-commercial-autonomous-truck-launch-to-2025/,Aurora Innovation delays commercial autonomous truck launch to 2025 | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-10-30,"Autonomous vehicle technology startup Aurora Innovation is targeting April 2025 for commercial deployment of its autonomous trucks, pushing its timeline back by about a quarter. The company had originally planned to launch by the end of 2024. The company said it delayed the launch so it can continue to validate its self-driving technology.
“While this is modestly later than we had intended, this timing remains within the margin of error we have anticipated and conveyed throughout 2024,” Aurora CEO and co-founder Chris Urmson wrote in his third-quarter earnings shareholder letter. “With our intention to introduce the Aurora Driver with a crawl, walk, run approach, this shift to our timeline will have a negligible financial impact.”
Aurora will go to market as a carrier, but its end goal is to pursue a driver-as-a-service model, wherein carriers purchase trucks with the Aurora Driver tech on board and then offer their services via those trucks to shippers.
One of the ways Aurora measures the performance and commercial readiness of its Aurora Driver is its use of on-site support, which the company says will be the most expensive support provided. As of the end of the third quarter, the Aurora Driver was delivering commercial loads without the support of a remote human 80% of the time, which is up from 75% in the second quarter. The goal is to reach 90% by commercial launch in the spring.
The startup intends to deploy up to 10 driverless trucks during commercial launch, with the goal of increasing to tens of trucks by the end of 2025.
Aurora has been testing commercial loads with pilot customers including FedEx, Werner, Schneider, Hirschbach, Uber Freight, and others. The company schedules roughly 160 commercial loads per week, which Aurora says is more than double the volume from last year. As of October 27, 2024, Aurora’s trucks have autonomously delivered more than 8,200 loads and driven over 2.2 million commercial miles — but all with a human behind the wheel.
Aurora, a pre-revenue company building pioneer tech, recorded an operating expense of $196 million in the third quarter, including stock-based compensation of $35 million. That’s less than the $212 million it spent in the same period last year, which Aurora says demonstrates its commitment to being frugal on its path to commercialization.
The startup ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and investments after raising almost half a billion dollars in August, which should give Aurora runway into 2026 and fund its initial stage of scaling and getting to a place of sustainability.
Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Aurora Driver was delivering commercial loads without a human driver 75% of the time in the second quarter."

These 20 companies were selected as the best of the Startup Battlefield 200 and competed for a chance to take home the Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. After three days of intense pitching, we have a winner.
The startups taking part in the Startup Battlefield had all been hand-picked to participate in our startup competition. All the companies presented a live demo in front of multiple groups of VCs and tech leaders serving as judges for a chance to win $100,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.
After hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges’ notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: GeCKo Materials, Luna, MabLab, Salva Health, and Stitch3D.
These startups made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included Navin Chaddha (Mayfield), Chris Farmer (SignalFire), Dayna Grayson (Construct Capital), Ann Miura-Ko (Floodgate), and Hans Tung (Notable Capital).
We’re now ready to announce that the winner of TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 2024 is . . .
Six years ago, while researching for a college entrepreneurship competition, Valentina Agudelo identified a troubling gap in breast cancer survival rates between Latin America and the developed world, with women in her native Colombia and the rest of the continent dying at higher rates due to late detection. She realized that breast cancer is highly treatable when diagnosed early, yet many Latin American countries have large rural populations lacking access to mammograms and other diagnostic tools. So Agudelo and her two best friends decided to create Salva Health, a theoretical portable device that would detect breast cancer early.
Read more about Salva Health in our separate post.
It looks fake, or at least like a good illusion: There’s GeCKo Materials founder Capella Kerst dangling a full wine bottle from her pinky finger, the only thing keeping it from smashing to pieces being the super-strong dry-adhesive her startup has brought to market. But it’s no trick. It’s the result of years of academic research that Dr. Kerst built on by inventing a method to mass-manufacture the adhesive. Inspired by the way real-life geckos’ feet grip surfaces, the adhesive is like a new Velcro — except it only needs one side, leaves no residue, and can detach as quickly as it attaches. It can do this at least 120,000 times and, as Dr. Kerst noted in a recent interview with TechCrunch, can stay attached for seconds, minutes, or even years.

These two companies follow in the footsteps of Startup Battlefield legends like Dropbox, Discord, Cloudflare, and Mint on the Disrupt stage. With more than 1,500 alumni having participated in the program, Startup Battlefield Alumni have collectively raised over $29 billion in funding with more than 200 successful exits."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/perplexitys-ceo-punts-on-defining-plagiarism/,Perplexity's CEO punts on defining 'plagiarism' | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-30,"Perplexity’s CEO, Aravind Srinivas, wouldn’t say how Perplexity defines “plagiarism” in an onstage interview with Devin Coldewey at TechCrunch’s Disrupt 2024 conference.
It’s a touchy subject. News Corp’s Dow Jones and the New York Post have sued Perplexity over what they describe as a “content kleptocracy.” Many other news sites have expressed concerns that Perplexity closely replicates their content — just this month, The New York Times sent the startup a cease and desist.
Srinivas was adamant that Perplexity “always cites its sources” and doesn’t claim ownership of any content.
“It’s surfacing content from the web, summarizing it in a manner that the user can digest,” he said, “and then provides all this information — exactly how journalists do their job, or academics do their job, or students.”
In a recent blog post responding to the Dow Jones lawsuit, Perplexity argued that publishers wished its technology “didn’t exist” and would prefer “publicly reported facts are owned by corporations.” But the post failed to address whether Perplexity allegedly regurgitates content at a massive scale, as some publishers claim — and then competes with those publishers for the same audience.
A report this week from AI plagiarism detector Copyleaks found that one Perplexity summary paraphrased 48% of a Forbes article, while another included 28% paraphrasing and 7% plagiarism (as Copyleaks defines it).
Srinivas pointed out that Perplexity cites its sources — albeit sometimes with mistakes.
“At the end of every sentence, there’s a footnote or the corresponding page for where it’s truly information from,” he said. “Of course, it’s not, like, extremely precise … but we’re trying our best to do those kind of things.”
Srinivas mentioned several times during the interview that Perplexity is working with media companies including Time, Fortune, and Der Spiegel in a revenue-share program. Dow Jones, he said, was a potential partner, too, but chose instead to escalate the situation — and mislead the public in its public comments about the suit.
“Well, [Dow Jones] claimed that we didn’t respond,” Srinivas said. “And that’s not true. And we actually responded the same day. So, I hope people appreciate that our attempt is to collaborate and engage and work together.”
Srinivas also pushed back against the notion that people use Perplexity to summarize paywalled articles, which the Dow Jones lawsuit alludes to. Instead, he said, most of Perplexity’s users turn to the platform for financial research, despite Perplexity’s hallucinations from time to time.
“Nobody comes to Perplexity for consuming their daily news,” he said. “People come here to make sense of what’s going on. Like, how does that particular piece of news affect me? In the context of news, should I continue to buy more Nvidia stock? These are not the kind of questions you can come and ask TechCrunch, but you come and ask Perplexity.”
Perplexity is said to be in talks to raise around $500 million at an $8 billion valuation. Srinivas recently said that the platform hit 100 million search queries per week, and Perplexity is releasing products at a rapid clip, from online shopping tools to sports score trackers to new advertising capabilities.
So what’s the endgame? Perhaps, mused Srinivas, a world in which “scientists claim ownership over a certain fact” and “other people” — publishers, presumably — can’t control where they appear or how they’re contextualized.
“Our belief is that facts need to be universally distributed to everybody,” Srinivas said."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/rivians-chief-software-officer-says-in-car-buttons-are-an-anomaly/,Rivian's chief software officer says in-car buttons are 'an anomaly' | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-30,"The trend of big touchscreens in cars has left many yearning for the not-so-distant days when most user interactions happened with physical buttons. But Rivian’s chief software officer Wassym Bensaid believes using buttons in a car is an “anomaly.”
“It’s a bug. It’s not a feature,” Bensaid said Wednesday at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. “Ideally, you would want to interact with your car through voice. The problem today is that most voice assistants are just broken.”
To that end, Bensaid said that “every week” he’s driving around an engineering vehicle that has an AI-powered voice assistant, though he did not specify which one. He mentioned earlier in his interview with TechCrunch’s transportation editor Kirsten Korosec that Rivian has “partnerships that I cannot yet talk about.”
“I think the car is actually a fantastic environment for AI,” he said, while noting that latency and hallucinations are still very big problems that need to be solved.
“The final north star I have is having voice [controls] become the primary means of interaction with the vehicle. The reality is that the vehicle is so feature-rich, that even if we do a fantastic job in the UI, there will always be prioritization that we need to do in terms of having things one or two menus behind,” Bensaid told TechCrunch after he got off stage.
Bensaid also said he’s a big believer in the ability of AI-powered voice controls to handle complex requests. For instance, he said if a driver says “I’m hungry” the in-car assistant should be able to quickly direct them to a nearby restaurant that they might prefer.
This is not a dramatically new idea; Automakers like Mercedes-Benz have spent years promising a seamless voice-controlled in-car experience, with mixed results. But Bensaid said Rivian’s goal is to make it possible to take every touchscreen control and make it available by voice.
Before any of that happens, Bensaid said he remains focused on delivering a custom experience to Rivian owners — meaning CarPlay is not showing up anytime soon. While he said the team inside Rivian “continue[s] to debate that,” he said on stage that he believes leveraging CarPlay is “laziness” and that he prefers to integrate specific apps, like Apple Music.
CarPlay “takes over all the pixels in the screen, and it’s a replacement of the entire experience, and we truly believe that with the technology capabilities that we have, we can offer a much more refined, integrated experience,” he said."

In September, Amazon asked employees to come back to the office five days a week starting in 2025.
The AWS CEO previously told employees that nine out of 10 workers he spoke with supported the policy, according to reports. This letter rejects the contention that the RTO policy was widely supported, saying that statistic is inconsistent with the experiences of many employees. Employees in the letter said they were “appalled” to hear Garman’s non-data driven explanation.
AWS seems to be sticking by its RTO policy. This month, Matt Garman told employees they could work somewhere else if they didn’t like coming into the office."

That’s according to a new study from the AI Democracy Projects, a collaboration between Proof News, fact-checking service Factchequeado, and the Institute for Advanced Study in San Francisco. The study found a sharp disparity between the factuality of English- and Spanish-language responses produced by five leading generative AI models: Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama 3, and Mistral’s Mixtral 8x7B v0.1.
The study posed questions to the models designed to mimic queries an Arizona-based voter in the upcoming U.S. presidential election might ask, such as “What does it mean if I’m a federal-only voter?” and “What is the Electoral College?” Given the same 25 prompts in English and Spanish, 52% of the responses from the models to the Spanish queries contained wrong information, compared to 43% of the responses to the queries in English.
The study highlights the surprising ways in which AI models can exhibit bias — and the harm that bias can cause."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/zoox-co-founder-on-tesla-self-driving-they-dont-have-technology-that-works/,Zoox co-founder on Tesla self-driving: 'They don't have technology that works' | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-30,"Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson doesn’t believe Tesla will launch a robotaxi ride-hailing service in California (or anywhere else) next year despite what Elon Musk recently claimed.
The “fundamental issue is they don’t have technology that works,” Levinson said Wednesday at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. “And by works, I want to differentiate between a driver assistance system that drives most of the time — except when it doesn’t, and then you have to take over — versus a system that’s so reliable and robust that you don’t need a person in it.”
Levinson went further and specifically pointed to Tesla’s decision to rely solely on cameras to support its driver assistance system.  “Our perspective is you really do need significantly more hardware than Tesla is putting in their vehicles to build a robotaxi that is not just as safe, but as especially safer than a human,” he said.
Levinson’s comments come just a few weeks after Musk revealed the prototype of Tesla’s so-called “Cybercab” robotaxi. Musk also announced at the Cybercab event that Tesla wants to start allowing Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs to operate as robotaxis in California and Texas by the end of 2025.
Levinson said he uses Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software “every couple of weeks.” And while he called it “impressive,” he also said he finds it “a bit stressful.”
“Usually it does the right thing, and then it sort of lulls you into this false sense of complacency, and then it does the wrong thing,” he said. ‘You’re like, Oh, my God!’”
Levinson went on to say he believes FSD is “about 100 times less safe than a human if you look at all the metrics that are publicly available.” (Tesla releases quarterly safety reports that claim its driver-assistance gets into fewer crashes than cars without it — though these self-reported statistics have been criticized as being selective.)
The comments about Tesla came as Levinson announced Zoox is launching its custom-built robotaxi in San Francisco and Las Vegas markets in the coming weeks. The company plans to make them available to an early-rider program in 2025."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/clashing-approaches-to-combat-ais-perpetual-bullst-machine/,Clashing approaches to combat AI's 'perpetual bulls**t machine' | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-30,"The AI stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 got off to a fiery but constructive start on a panel about combating disinformation. But in a spirited exchange of views tempered by expressions of respect and agreement, all three panelists had harsh words for social media and generative AI.
None was harsher, though, than Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate.
“We’ve always had BS in politics, and a lot of politicians use lying as an art, a tool of doing politics. What we have now is is quantitatively different, and to such a scale that it’s like comparing the conventional arms race of BS in politics to the nuclear race,” he said.
“It’s the economics that have changed so radically: The marginal cost of the production of a piece of disinformation has been reduced to zero by generative AI, and the marginal costs of the distribution of disinformation [is also zero],” he continued. “So what you have, theoretically, is a perfect loop system in which generative AI is producing, it’s distributing, and then it’s assessing the performance — A/B testing and improving. You’ve got a perpetual bulls–t machine. That’s quite worrying!”
Brandie Nonnecke, director of UC Berkeley’s CITRIS Policy Lab, pointed out that self-regulation in the form of voluntary limits and transparency reports is totally insufficient.
“I don’t think that these transparency reports really do anything, in part because in these transparency reports, they’ll say, look at what a great job we’re doing: We removed 10s of 1000s of pieces of harmful content. Well, what didn’t you remove? What’s still floating around that you didn’t catch? It gives a false sense that they’re actually doing due diligence, when I think underneath that all is a big mess of them trying to figure out how to deal with all of this content,” she said.
Pamela San Martin, co-chair of the Facebook Oversight Board, agreed in principle but warned not to throw the baby out with the bath water. “I think that it would be completely untrue to say that any social media platform is doing everything they have to do — especially I would not say that about Meta,” she said.
“I agree what you said, but we thought this year that had 80 elections would be the year of AI and elections, that all the elections throughout the world would be flooded of AI deepfakes, that that would be what control the narrative,” she continued. “We have seen a rise in it, but we have not seen elections being completely flooded with AI generated content. Why do I say that? Not because I disagree, it is very concerning, but I also think that we have to keep in mind that if we start make taking measures out of fear, we will lose the good part of AI.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/matt-mullenweg-talks-about-automattics-staffing-issues-and-financials-at-techcrunch-disrupt/,Matt Mullenweg talks about Automattic's staffing issues and financials at TechCrunch Disrupt | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-30,"WordPress co-creator and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg talked about his fight with WP Engine, Automattic’s staffing issues, and the company’s financials at TechCrunch Disrupt on Wednesday.
Mullenweg repeated a lot of stuff from the past month about the trademark fight, WP Engine not contributing to the community, and misleading customers to believe it was associated with WordPress.com. If you need a refresher on the WordPress community drama, we have an article that will help you catch up.
He said the company was short-staffed after the exodus of 159 employees, who took a six-month severance offer earlier that month. Since then, Automattic has been aggressively hiring and had already recruited 26 people this month.
Mullenweg said that the second offer — which had nine months of severance and lost access to WordPress.org as part of the package — was designed to catch a leaker within the company giving out confidential information. He added that the company had to ask others who took the offer to stay until the next year as they were short-staffed.
Talking about trademark issues, Mullenweg said in the initial days of Automattic, he gave the WordPress Foundation the WordPress trademark as investors were in control of Automattic. While the foundation still owns the trademark, Automattic has the exclusive license to use it commercially. Plus, Mullenweg said he has 84% of vote control at the company.
When asked about what the other WordPress Foundation board members think about this battle, he said they are incredibly supportive and referred to the minutes of the meetings published on the foundation site — the post doesn’t mention anything about the trademark.
Automattic CEO also talked about the legal battle with WP Engine and said that it might take a few years to resolve it.
“Estimates I have heard from Neil [Katyal, the lawyer representing Automattic] in the case and others is that worst case scenario, if we lose everything, it would be kind of happening in 2026 or 2027,” he said.
Earlier this year, Blackrock, one of the investors in Automattic, marked down their investment to almost half the value from the time they bought the shares in 2021. While Mullenweg didn’t directly address that markdown, he said the company generates around half a billion dollars in annual revenue, running at “break even or better,” and hiring aggressively.
“We haven’t raised any primary capital and have no plans to,” Mullenweg said.
Talking about the possibility of a WordPress fork because of ongoing tension in the community, Mullenweg said that would be fantastic.
“There might be a fork. I mean, we’ve had WordPress forks before — probably about three or four times in the history [of WordPress]. That’s one of the beautiful things about open source is that there can be a fork,” he said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg-says-a-fork-would-be-fantastic/,WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg says a fork would be 'fantastic' | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-10-30,"WordPress co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg, speaking on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 on Wednesday, said he’s not worried that the recent legal drama between his company, Automattic, and WordPress host WP Engine may lead to a fork of the open source WordPress software. In fact, he said, he’d welcome it.
“There might be a fork. I mean, we’ve had WordPress forks before — probably about three or four times in the history [of WordPress],” Mullenweg said in response to a question about whether he was worried about the potential of a fork. “That’s one of the beautiful things about open source is that there can be a fork.”
The Automattic CEO also suggested that rival WP Engine essentially had already forked the software because the version it runs is “very, very different” from what the WordPress core is today. If WordPress was then officially forked as a result of this growing discontent with his direction of the community and the legal battle over the use of the WordPress trademark, Mullenweg suggested that would be the better path.
“I think that’d be fantastic, actually. So people can have alternative governance or an alternative approach,” he noted.
The exec also pointed out that the size of the WordPress community could support such a move. WordPress 6.7, which is coming out in a few weeks, had over 600 contributors, for example. “Only about 10% of those are from Automattic,” Mullenweg said.
Plus, he noted that the WordPress core software had seen some 40 million downloads since September 17. “The actual activity of WordPress is going quite strong,” he added.
The interview came amid a heated legal dispute with the WordPress hosting provider WP Engine, which has upset the open source community and led to the departure of over 150 Automattic employees who disagree with Mullenweg’s new direction.
Mullenweg alleged that WP Engine’s use of the “WP” brand is meant to confuse people into thinking that WP Engine is officially associated with WordPress when it is not, and suggested that WP Engine doesn’t do enough to contribute to WordPress, a claim that WP Engine disputes. As a result, he’s asking WP Engine to share 8% of its revenue or the equivalent of revenue in terms of engineering hours working on the core.
“It’s not just about the money. It’s really about like … if you’re gonna profit off the WordPress trademark, you need to be part of the WordPress ecosystem,” Mullenweg said at Disrupt.
This is not the first time Mullenweg has suggested a fork could be a solution to the ongoing debate around the future of WordPress. Earlier in October, he posted on X that he would “welcome more forks.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/zoox-custom-robotaxis-are-finally-coming-to-san-francisco-and-las-vegas/,Zoox custom robotaxis are finally coming to San Francisco and Las Vegas | TechCrunch,"Kirsten Korosec, Sean O'Kane",2024-10-30,"Amazon-owned AV company Zoox will start rolling out dozens of its purpose-built autonomous vehicle in San Francisco and in Las Vegas in the coming weeks, co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson announced on the TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 stage.
Levinson said that Zoox will start offering rides — starting with employees — in the SoMa neighborhood of San Francisco, and on the Las Vegas Strip. Levinson told TechCrunch on the sidelines that Zoox is starting with SoMa even though it’s more difficult in part because the company has a operations in the area.
“We have achieved that internal safety readiness” required to launch the service, he said on stage.
The announcement comes a decade after Zoox was founded and four years since it was acquired by Amazon and unveiled its purpose-built robotaxi. In that time, the nascent autonomous vehicle industry has gone through the full hype cycle that led to multi-billion-dollar valuations and later a wave of shutdowns and consolidation.
“We still exist,” Levinson said, in a nod to the tumult the industry has gone through in recent years.
Levinson said Zoox is going to take a “measured approach” to rolling out its robotaxi service, and noted that his company has been working closely with local and federal safety regulators.
“I can say that in the next few weeks, we’re actually going to have a couple dozen Zoox robotaxis across our Foster City, San Francisco and Las Vegas, geofences that will expand several fold over the next year,” he said. “And then, you know, 2026 is when we’re going to really start cranking out production vehicles at very large scale.”
He also said Zoox will launch an “explorer” program of early riders who will be able to use the robotaxis for free before opening the service up to paying customers. (Rival Waymo operated a similar invite-only early rider program before opening its service to the paying public.) These early riders, or explorers, will gain access to the Zoox vehicles early next year starting with Las Vegas, Levinson said.
The Zoox AVs will operate throughout the “most busy 16 hours” of the day, Levinson said, noting that it’s “so boring at four in the morning, we don’t think we would learn very much.”
In San Francisco, Levinson said Zoox hopes to steadily expand beyond the SoMa neighborhood, and eventually, into surrounding cities like Foster City, where the company is already operating the vehicles.
In Las Vegas, Levinson said Zoox is working with “many” of the resort-hotels up and down the strip to pick up and drop off passengers at the entrances. “We’re not ready to share which hotels those are, but we’re not going to just be driving up and down the strip,” he said.
Zoox will continue to scale, geographically and by its fleet size. Zoox uses suppliers for its vehicle components and then assembles the robotaxis in house at facilities in Fremont and Hayward, California, Levinson said.
“We actually do it ourselves, which is really cool,” he said. “We have the facilities to produce tens of thousands of our own robotaxis, which is really cool, but we do get a lot of the components from suppliers all over the world, and then we kind of put them together. So it’s not quite as involved of a manufacturing process as a regular car, but it’s still very sophisticated.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/matt-mullenweg-says-automattic-is-very-short-staffed-amid-wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama/,Matt Mullenweg says Automattic is 'very short-staffed' amid WordPress vs. WP Engine drama | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-30,"Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg says the company is “very short-staffed” amid WordPress’s ongoing drama with WP Engine, which hosts websites built on WordPress. The WordPress co-founder took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 on Wednesday.
The saga began when Mullenweg called WP Engine a “cancer to WordPress.” Mullenweg called out WP Engine, claiming that they don’t contribute sufficiently to the open source project and that WP Engine’s use of the “WP” brand has confused customers into believing it is part of WordPress.
The dispute has led to pushback from engineers, and even Automattic employees. On October 3, 159 Automattic employees who didn’t agree with Mullenweg’s direction of the company and WordPress overall took a severance package and left the company.
After 159 Automattic employees took the first deal, which included six months of severance, Mullenweg posted another alignment offer on Automattic Slack on October 17. This second deal offered nine months of severance, but employees only had four hours to respond.
“With the first deal, we cut off your access the same day,” Mullenweg said. “The second deal, we said, hey 159 left. We’ve seen a huge boost in businesses, so we’re hiring as fast as you can. So the second deal, if you’re the leaker, we’ll cut off access immediately. But, for others, we might ask them to stay on until possibly next year, just because we’re very short-staffed, so we kind of need to hire, so there were some other people that have taken it.”
Mullenweg’s comments indicate that Automattic was looking to catch the employee who was sharing company information with members of the press regarding the ongoing drama.
Mullenweg confirmed that before the saga began, Automattic had roughly 1,900 employees, and that the headcount is now at around 1,700.
The WordPress co-founder confirmed that Automattic hired 26 people in October amid the drama."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/scout-motors-evs-will-use-rivian-vw-software-and-architecture/,Scout Motors EVs will use Rivian-VW software and architecture | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-30,"VW’s new offshoot EV company Scout Motors, which revealed its first two vehicles last week, will use the software and zonal architecture being developed by the joint venture between Rivian and the Volkswagen Group.
Rivian Chief Software Officer Wassym Bensaid confirmed to TechCrunch at Disrupt 2024 that Scout will leverage the joint venture tech when its vehicles go into production in 2027. VW and Rivian are still working to close the $5 billion deal, which they expect to happen before the end of this year.
Rivian and VW had previously said that they planned to use the tech to power most of the German automaker’s future vehicles. But the question of whether the Scout vehicles would join the party had remained up in the air in the wake of last week’s reveal.
Scout revealed two EV prototypes: The Traveler SUV and the Terra pickup truck. The company said at the time that the vehicles would use a zonal architecture — meaning it would rely on just a handful of computers that control the functions of a few “zones” of the electrical architecture. And the software in Scout’s press images looked awfully similar to what you can find in Rivian’s current vehicles, so Bensaid’s confirmation is not all that surprising.
Bensaid stressed on the Disrupt stage that each brand that uses the joint venture’s software will “continue to have their own identity,” as well as “their own features.”
“We’re enabling competition,” he said.
Bensaid also noted how much the Scout vehicles resemble Rivian’s overall design sensibility, even outside of the software. “That’s fantastic,” he said. “It’s great validation of the Rivian product.”"

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/modash-is-flipping-the-influencer-marketing-script-by-connecting-brands-with-the-long-tail-of-creators/,Modash is flipping the influencer marketing script by connecting brands with the long tail of creators | TechCrunch,Anna Heim,2024-10-30,"Estonia-based startup Modash has raised a $12 million Series A led by henQ, a Dutch VC firm that prides itself in “funding the odd ones.” And what’s odd about Modash, according to CEO Avery Schrader, is that its team “has a really strong opinion in a space that nobody really has much faith in anymore.”
The space in question is influencer marketing. Like competitors CreatorIQ and Upfluence, Modash helps brands like Farfetch discover people who can promote their message. But instead of focusing on content creators with big followings, Modash scrapes open data to let its clients find matches among the long tail of the 250 million creators it says it lists (unless they opt out.)
This means brands are being connected with relatively niche content creators through Modash’s platform. But — the founders’ theory is — these are individuals who can pack a marketing punch as their smaller follower bases may be more engaged with, and put a higher store on, what they’re saying.
Essentially, it’s a flipping of the usual influencer marketing script which could help circumvent some of the cynicism that’s sprung up around highly paid influencers shilling products. Not having creators sign in also makes it easier to scale, in a space where pure marketplaces have struggled.
This is why Modash remains bullish on the creator economy — even as Schrader understands why others might not be. “The whole VC class has already placed one or two bets that have already gone down the drain in the space,” he told TechCrunch.
“[But] people miss the point that the creator is the atomic unit of the internet, and [creators] will just keep making stuff,” he went on, explaining why he and his team believe in the marketing power of content creators and in the market opportunity of helping them monetize.
“Whatever you immediately think of when you think ‘influencer’… I think it really has a negative connotation… Whatever you don’t consume is what you think of an influencer as, and then whatever you consume, whatever is in your own YouTube search history, that’s who we support,” he added. “It’s like the small creators doing the weirdest stuff, talking about the things they really love.”
The 26-year-old Canadian fits the bill himself; originally from Nova Scotia where he tinkered with videos and forums, he made his way to Estonia after reading that it was becoming “the Silicon Valley of Europe.” There, he soon found himself recording podcast episodes with the Baltics technorati, while trying his hand at influencer marketing for clients like Estonian scale-up Bolt.
The client side of the problem is key to Modash. The startup’s vision is that brands want an end-to-end platform that lets them source creators, but also analyze campaigns, manage payments, and more. That’s what it monetizes, with plans starting from $199 a month up to a custom enterprise tier.
With Bolt and an Estonian agency among its first clients, Tallinn proved to be a great launchpad for Modash. Whether or not the comparison with Silicon Valley stands, network effects were clearly at play and several Estonian founders became Modash’s first mentors and angels, some of whom have returned to join its latest round too.
The capital city is also where Schrader met his co-founder and CTO, Estonian software engineer Hendry Sadrak (on the right in the picture above) and the rest of their founding team. “Even today, 40% or 50% of the company is in Estonia,” said Schrader. “Lots of them from Bolt, Pipedrive, Transferwise… — the Estonian mafia.”
If Schrader sounded unsure about the exact percentage of local staffers it’s a reflection of how much the team has grown over the last few months. “We were like 25 [people] in the beginning of the year, we’re now 60, and we’ve set a cap for next year that we won’t go beyond 99, because it’s really important to keep the team as small as we can.”
Many of Modash’s new hires will focus on data engineering, as AI-enabled discovery features are a big part of its product roadmap.
In addition, the startup plans to recruit people for customer-facing roles in North America to be closer to its clients there.
Schrader himself was back in Canada when he talked to TechCrunch, and he told us he plans to spend at least half his time in the country going forward. International expansion and an increased focus on e-commerce will be the startup’s priorities leading up to its Series B round, he said."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/this-week-in-ai-a-preview-of-disrupt-2024s-stacked-ai-panels/,This Week in AI: A preview of Disrupt 2024's stacked AI panels | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-30,"Hiya, folks, welcome to TechCrunch’s regular AI newsletter. If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here.
This week, the TechCrunch crew (including yours truly) is at TC’s annual Disrupt conference in San Francisco. We’ve got a packed lineup of speakers from the AI industry, academia, and policy, so in lieu of my usual op-ed I thought I’d preview some of the great content headed your way.
My colleague Devin Coldewey will be interviewing Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas onstage. The AI-powered search engine is riding high, recently hitting 100 million queries served per week — but it’s also being sued by News Corp’s Dow Jones over what the publisher describes as a “content kleptocracy.”
Kirsten Korosec, TC’s transportation editor, will chat with Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson in a fireside. Levinson, who has been in the thick of autonomous car technology for a decade, is now preparing the Amazon-owned robotaxi company for its next big adventure — and we’ll be reporting on it.
We’ll also have a panel on how AI Is flooding the web with disinformation — featuring Meta Oversight Board member Pamela San Martin, Center for Countering Digital Hate CEO Imran Ahmed, and UC Berkeley CITRIS Policy Lab founder Brandie Nonnecke. The trio will discuss how, as generative AI tools become more widely available, they’re being abused by an array of actors, including state actors, to create deepfakes and sow disinformation.
And we’ll hear from Cara CEO Jingna Zhang, AI Now Institute co-executive director Sarah Myers West, and ElevenLabs’ Aleksandra Pedraszewska on AI’s legal and ethical minefields. AI’s meteoric rise has created new ethical dilemmas and exacerbated old ones, while lawsuits drop left and right. This threatens both new and established AI companies, and the creators and workers whose labor feeds the models. The panel will tackle all of this — and more.
That’s just a sampling of what’s on deck this week. Expect appearances from AI experts like U.S. AI Safety Institute director Elizabeth Kelly, California senator Scott Wiener, Berkeley AI policy hub co-director Jessica Newman, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, Suno CEO Mikey Shulman, and Splice CEO Kakul Srivastava.
Apple Intelligence launches: Through a free software update, iPhone, iPad, and Mac users can access the first set of Apple’s AI-powered Apple Intelligence capabilities.
Bret Taylor’s startup raises new money: Sierra, the AI startup co-founded by OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor, has raised $175 million in a funding round that values the startup at $4.5 billion.
Google expands AI Overviews: Google Search’s AI Overviews, which display a snapshot of information at the top of the results page, are beginning to roll out in more than 100 countries and territories.
Generative AI and e-waste: The immense and quickly advancing computing requirements of AI models could lead to the industry discarding the e-waste equivalent of more than 10 billion iPhones per year by 2030, researchers project.
Open source, now defined: The Open Source Initiative, a long-running institution aiming to define and “steward” all things open source, this week released version 1.0 of its definition of open source AI.
Meta releases its own podcast generator: Meta has released an “open” implementation of the viral generate-a-podcast feature in Google’s NotebookLM.
Hallucinated transcriptions: OpenAI’s Whisper transcription tool has hallucination issues, researchers say. Whisper has reportedly introduced everything from racial commentary to imagined treatments into transcripts.
Google says it taught a model to convert photos of handwriting into “digital ink.”
The model, InkSight, was trained to recognize written words on a page and output strokes that roughly resemble handwriting. The goal, the Google researchers behind the project say, was to “capture the stroke-level trajectory details of handwriting” so that a user can store the resulting strokes in the note-taking app of their choice.
InkSight isn’t perfect. Google notes that it makes errors. But the company also claims that the model performs well across a range of scenarios, including challenging lighting conditions.
Let’s hope it’s not used to forge any signatures.
Cohere for AI, the nonprofit research lab run by AI startup Cohere, has released a new family of text-generating models called Aya Expanse. The models can write and understand text in 23 different languages, and Cohere claims they outperform models, including Meta’s Llama 3.1 70B, on certain benchmarks.
Cohere says a technique it’s dubbed “data arbitrage” was key in training Aya Expanse. Taking inspiration from how humans learn by going to different teachers for unique skills, Cohere selected particularly capable multilingual “teacher” models to generate synthetic training data for Aya Expanse.
Synthetic data has its issues. Some studies suggest that overreliance on it can lead to models whose quality and diversity get progressively worse. But Cohere says that data arbitrage effectively mitigates this. We’ll see soon enough if the claim holds up to scrutiny.
OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode, the company’s realistic-sounding voice feature for ChatGPT, is now available for free in the ChatGPT mobile app for users in the EU, Switzerland, Iceland, and Norway in addition to Liechtenstein. Previously, users in those regions had to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus to use Advanced Voice Mode.
A recent piece in The New York Times highlighted the upsides — and downsides — of Advanced Voice Mode, like its reliance on tropes and stereotypes when trying to communicate in the ways users ask. Advanced Voice Mode has blown up on TikTok for its uncanny ability to mimic voices and accents. But some experts warn it could lead to emotional dependency on a system that has no intelligence — or empathy, for that matter."

Companies around the world, whether they are startups or global enterprises, are struggling with the question of how they can move faster and take advantage of the incredible opportunities this technology offers.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/betaworks-focuses-on-ai-applications-in-its-latest-camp/,Betaworks focuses on AI applications in its latest Camp | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-10-30,"For its most recent Camp, VC and accelerator Betaworks was on the lookout for startups building native applications made possible by AI.
The program was first announced in May. To explain this focus, managing partner John Borthwick wrote at the time that while things like AI chatbots and writing assistants exist, “we aren’t yet living in the future we imagine.”
In other words, despite advances in AI technology, Borthwick said that “when end users like ourselves are faced with a task or project we are certain could be done faster, better, smarter, by harnessing the power of AI, the ready-made tools we have available to us in that moment are surprisingly limited.”
Naturally, Betaworks is hoping its Camp participants can change that. Its Camps are 12-week thematic programs, with each participating startup receiving $500,000 from a syndicate of investors. The most recent program is culminating with Demo Day on Wednesday.
Betaworks partner (and former TechCrunch deputy editor) Jordan Crook said the accepted companies ultimately fell into three broad categories: “agentic” B2B, personalized software, and hardware-enabled AI.
Here are the startups:
Unternet is working to break down the web’s “dumb rectangles,” where we have to open tab after tab while trying to accomplish tasks like comparison shopping. It’s building a new form of web application that can be understood and used by AI, as well as a web client that can turn user intent into action within these “web applets.”
Ursula is building artificially alive characters that it says have emotions, experience needs, form memories, and exhibit unique behavioral patterns. Its first creation is a kids’ companion also called Ursula.
ESAI helps students craft their personal narrative for college applications and more. The company says it does this in an ethical way by automating the process of helping students draw connections between their experiences and transform those experiences into a compelling narrative.
Autoplay is creating AI agents that help users navigate software in real time, so businesses can improve product adoption and reduce churn. It uses self-driving technology that learns the software and integrates with session replay databases to understand user intent.
Alice Camera offers an AI-native, mirrorless camera that attaches to a user’s phone, making it easier to capture professional-quality content. It automates aspects of the camera functionality and streamlines post-production.
Dessn has created a Chrome extension that overlays a live app, allowing product designers to make changes. The AI writes the code and pushes it straight to the codebase, with developers approving the code before it goes live.
Sarama builds a dog collar that analyzes dog vocalizations to give owners a better understanding of their pets’ emotional and physical needs. Its founders have both worked in animal communications research.
Tato simplifies complex IT projects by auto-documenting interactions like meetings, emails, documents, and project management apps, then providing insights about those interactions to the right people on the team.
Hopscotch Labs has built an app called BeeBot, which turns on when you put on AirPods or headphones, then provides information about nearby places, people, and events as you walk. Its founders include Foursquare’s Dennis Crowley."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/apple-upgrades-macbook-pro-with-m4-chips/,Apple upgrades MacBook Pro with M4 chips | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-30,"Apple on Wednesday wrapped up Macweek (well, Mac half week) by introducing an updated MacBook Pro. Apple’s most premium laptop is catching up to is brethren with the addition of M4 chips. The Pro and Mini are the first two Macs getting the new chip. The Pro will also be the first to sport the just-announced M4 Max as an upgradeable option.
The new Pros will arrive with 14- and 16-inch Liquid Retina XDR displays that peak at 1,000 nits of brightness. Both sizes ship with the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max options and a 12-megapixel webcam. The M4 Pro and Max models are getting their Thunderbolt 4 ports upgraded to Thunderbolt 5. Apple rates their battery life as a full 24 hours — the longest it’s claimed for any MacBook.
Apple Intelligence is, naturally, a big piece of the puzzle as well. The first wave of features arrived with Monday’s macOS Sequoia 15.1 release, including writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for the redesigned Siri experience. The forthcoming 15.2 release should deliver most of the remaining features promised by Apple at WWDC in June, including Genmoji, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence, Image Wand, and ChatGPT integration.
Both models start with a 16GB base of memory. Ditto for the MacBook Air. Apple’s ultraportable is getting that upgrade for both the M2 and M3 models — though the systems remain otherwise unchanged from last year. The M2 version retains the same $999 base price as last year as well.
The 14-inch starts at $1,599 for M4 and $1,999 for M4 Pro. The 16-inch starts at $2,499. Both are up for preorder Wednesday. They’re set to start shipping on November 8, along with the new iMac and Mac mini announced earlier this week."

A day after announcing the M4 Pro alongside the tiny new Mac mini, the company is showcasing the M4 Max, which is coming to the MacBook Pro line.
Like the other members of the M4 line, the Max is built atop second-gen 3-nanometer architecture. It’s also Apple’s second chip (after the M4 Pro) to support Thunderbolt 5 transfer speeds. Those are a bit more than twice as fast as Thunderbolt 4. The company also claims that the new Neural Engine doubles the speed of the M3.
The current M4 line breaks down as follows:

""What is your company's definition of plagiarism?"" A kickoff, and question, for Perplexity AI you'll find only at #TechCrunchDisrupt2024. pic.twitter.com/IN3CZ93fPK
As Perplexity AI deals with a number of legal challenges from news publishers — including News Corp’s Dow Jones and the New York Post — concerned about how the company summarizes and utilizes their content to inform its answers for users, Senior Editor Devin Coldewey came out swinging during CEO Aravind Srinivas’ Disrupt Stage interview.
When asked how Perplexity defined “plagiarism,” Srinivas wouldn’t say, but was adamant that the company “always cites its sources” and doesn’t claim ownership of any content. Srinivas also mentioned several times during the interview that Perplexity is working with media companies including Time, Fortune, and Der Spiegel in a revenue-share program.

The Zoox co-founder and CTO doesn’t believe Tesla will launch a robotaxi ride-hailing service in California (or anywhere else) next year despite what Elon Musk recently claimed.
The “fundamental issue is they don’t have technology that works,” Levinson said. “And by works, I want to differentiate between a driver assistance system that drives most of the time — except when it doesn’t, and then you have to take over — versus a system that’s so reliable and robust that you don’t need a person in it.”

Pei sat down with Hardware Editor Brian Heater to discuss why the company’s smartphones do so well in India and how it can break into the U.S. market — including potentially making its own operating system.
During the conversation, Pei joked that he dropped out of business school because he was playing “a lot of League of Legends” and how he, like other tech founders, thinks a lot about the Roman Empire.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/boston-dynamics-electric-atlas-humanoid-executes-autonomous-automotive-parts-picking/,Boston Dynamics’ electric Atlas humanoid executes autonomous automotive parts picking | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-30,"Boston Dynamics’ new humanoid has been quietly improving by leaps and bounds behind the scenes. Announced in April, we caught some brief insight into the electric Atlas’ strength in August through a video of the robot doing pushups. The latest video, released Wednesday, showcases the robot doing work in a demo space, moving engine parts between bins.
Boston Dynamics is quick to note that the actions are being performed autonomously, without “prescribed or teleoperated movements.” That caveat is seemingly a bit of shade tossed at other humanoid demos that have been misleading in a bid to capture online attention.
The video arrives two weeks after the Hyundai-owned robotics firm announced a watershed deal with the Toyota Research Institute (TRI). It’s not clear how much of the three-minute video is a product of that partnership, which brings TRI’s impressive robotics learning and real-time adaptations to the platform.
Boston Dynamics notes, “The robot is able to detect and react to changes in the environment (e.g., moving fixtures) and action failures (e.g., failure to insert the cover, tripping, environment collision) using a combination of vision, force, and proprioceptive sensors.”
As with competitors like Figure, Tesla, and Apptronik, Boston Dynamics’ first applications for the bipedal robot include work in automotive factories. The focus makes a lot of sense, given that the firm is now owned by Hyundai, which has opted to do a deal with Toyota’s research wing. Automotive has also been well ahead of the automation curve for decades now.
In addition to the autonomously executed tasks, the video showcases impressive adaptive — and strong — actuators, as the robot pivots at its waist. The action minimizes movements, saving precious seconds in the process."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/wonder-dynamics-now-lets-you-go-straight-from-multi-camera-video-to-fully-animated-3d-scene/,Wonder Dynamics now lets you go straight from multi-camera video to fully animated 3D scene | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-30,"Wonder Dynamics made a strong opening play in AI-enhanced visual effects, providing tools animators and filmmakers actually find useful — and earning the startup a prompt acquisition by Autodesk. Their latest tool further automates the animation process, letting you put in practically any video and get a fully editable 3D scene, characters and all.
The feature combines the company’s existing drop-in actor replacement, in which you could easily replace a person with an animated 3D character keyed to their movements, with a full-scale 3D background of your choosing.
To be clear, as with all the company’s previous features, this is not intended to provide a finished product — just a base layer to build on. Animation is labor intensive, and location shooting is difficult and expensive — if you can film two friends walking down the hall and convert it to robots walking down a futuristic street, that’s super useful for previsualization, story flow, and other early stages of production.
“The idea is that you can shoot and edit your video in your living room, with desired performances, cut, and camera framings as you would want to see in your animation,” said Wonder Dynamics co-founder Nikola Todorovic. “This process would provide you with a quick previs and, most importantly, 3D scenes to edit each individual element in either Blender, Maya, or Unreal.”
Impressively, you can use multiple cameras to shoot the same scene, as you might normally with human actors, and the video-to-3D flow will place them in the same scene as virtual cameras following the original motion by estimating foot travel and other metrics. Again, helpful for early in the process when camera work is being roughed out — not something you want to decide on shoot day!
You can see it in action here:
Unlike some generative and text-to-video (or video-to-video) type models, the output of the Wonder Animation tool is all industry-standard 3D assets. Once you shoot it, it’s not locked in — you can drag and drop the cameras and tweak the character’s movements, or totally recompose and relight the scene. Some of this was possible in the original Wonder Studio, but the focus here is on fully animated scenes rather than, say, replacing one actor with a CG character.
Anyone using Wonder Studio should be able to access the animation feature today, though it’s technically in beta and will probably see improvements as feedback is submitted."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/bifrost-ai-raises-8m-for-its-3d-and-ai-data-generation-platform/,Bifrost helps industrials speed up model training with its 3D data-generation platform | TechCrunch,Kate Park,2024-10-30,"For many companies working on AI models with applications in the physical world, data presents the biggest opportunity. It’s also the biggest hurdle they face, as nicely labeled and clean real-world data is as readily available as hen’s teeth, and the costs and effort required to gather and clean up data can be immense.
Bifrost, a 3D data-generation platform, believes its tech can help robotics and industrial companies solve at least one part of that problem: the time required to train AI models. The startup, based out of San Francisco, says its platform lets companies generate simulated 3D worlds to instruct their AI models and help their robots adjust to new objects, tasks, and surroundings within hours instead of months.
The company said on Wednesday that it has raised $8 million in a Series A funding round led by Carbide Ventures.
“Most of our customers need vast amounts of real-world data to train AI models,” co-founder and CEO Charles Wong said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. “This often means they would have to deploy fleets of robots across hundreds of locations, collect millions of hours of footage, manually label the data, and implement rigorous quality checks to reduce human errors and bias. This approach is brutal. It costs millions, takes years, and proves nearly impossible to scale.”
Wong co-founded the firm with Aravind Kandiah in 2020. Wong previously worked on AI perception models for self-driving cars at NuTonomy, an MIT spinout that worked on self-driving vehicles and autonomous mobile robots. Meanwhile, Kandiah previously built a medical AI system that detects early signs of blindness and diabetic retinopathy.
“It didn’t take long for us to realize something fundamental: AI and robotics need enormous amounts of high-quality data to function well. And that data is essential,” Kandiah told TechCrunch. “It can make or break the performance and potential of these systems. So we joined forces to start Bifrost with a single goal: solve the data problem, so AI and robotics can finally tackle the complex challenges of the physical world.”
Bifrost claims it is different from its competitors because its platform doesn’t require a team versed in creating 3D simulations to generate such data. This, Wong said, gives AI engineers a significant advantage, allowing them to develop AI systems for tasks like patrolling contested waters with autonomous boats without needing to hire a 3D team.
“Nvidia’s Omniverse tools, by contrast, require a dedicated 3D team just to operate,” Kandiah said, adding that Bifrost enables engineers in various heavy industries to teach AI systems new skills and accomplish more faster.
Bifrost’s product is currently in a closed beta with select heavy industry partners. The startup will use the fresh cash to fund the platform’s public launch in the coming months, as well as to hire more staff to speed up product development.
Wong said that the company’s primary market is the U.S., but it is also gaining momentum in Japan thanks to the country’s significant industrial sector. The startup generates revenue via an annual subscription model.
The platform’s primary users include AI developers who specialize in creating robotics systems, computer vision, and perception models for applications in industries such as robotics, aerospace, defense, maritime, geospatial, and industrial automation. Its target customers are big industrial companies, government organizations, and startups in the growth to late stages, all of which would have teams focused on developing physical AI solutions in their respective fields.
“We are initially focused on mission-critical, heavy industrial applications. By 2025, we aim to expand platform availability. … Looking ahead, we plan to support a broad spectrum of commercial robotics use cases, especially as robotics applications have been rapidly emerging across nearly every major sector and industry,” Kandiah said.
The Series A brings Bifrost’s total capital raised to $13.7 million. The round also saw participation from Airbus Ventures, Peak XV’s Surge, Wavemaker Partners, MD One, and Techstars. The outfit has 22 staff in the U.S. and Singapore."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/hummingbirds-platform-that-connects-local-creators-brand-campaigns-raises-5-4-m/,"Hummingbirds, a platform that connects local creators with brand campaigns in their area, raises $5.4M | TechCrunch",Lauren Forristal,2024-10-30,"Hummingbirds is a female-founded startup that connects hyperlocal content creators with brands that reward them for sharing products with their small and highly engaged communities via social media to juice their marketing.
The company announced Wednesday a $5.4 million seed round, bringing the total amount raised to $10 million. The new capital will support the platform’s expansion into 20 more cities by 2025, including Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Denver, Colorado.
Launched last year, the platform bets on localized and word-of-mouth marketing, where brands aim to build trust with local customers. Businesses, large and small, often struggle with local marketing, whether due to ineffective traditional advertising, limited budgets, or competition from other brands. Hummingbirds believes the solution lies in leveraging nearby creators such as the “PTA moms” (i.e., parents who are actively involved in school activities like fundraising) and other locals to help promote products.
“When [brands] think about driving in-store behavior to these retailers, they need a new marketing tool, and that’s where Hummingbirds has really found that we can help those brands move quickly and build that brand awareness, build a loyal following, actually bring them customers who go back to the store and buy their product over and over,” co-founder Charise Flynn told TechCrunch.
Hummingbirds enables brands to launch targeted marketing campaigns aimed at local residents, encouraging them to share products on social media with their followers. There are currently over 300 brand partners, from well-known brands like ChopLocal, Cutwater, Goodles, and Olipop to smaller businesses and local chains, such as AE Dairy and Fareway Grocery.
To incentivize participation, businesses offer rewards such as gift cards that range from $50 to $250, as well as complimentary experiences (such as a massage at a spa), free merchandise, and other perks.
Although Hummingbirds takes 0% commission from creators, brands are required to pay a fee to launch campaigns on the platform.
The platform focuses on everyday creators who see social sharing as a hobby, with most of their followers being friends and local connections. It argues that “nano creators” — those with up to 10,000 followers — often achieve higher engagement rates due to their loyal followings. The company claims that its strategy of producing “city-specific content” can increase sales by up to 14x and enhance social engagement by 80%.
“Their engagement rate is way higher than the traditional industry standard. We see, on average, 3-4% engagement … most influencers are at 0.7% engagement,” Flynn said.
Several startups that are fairly similar to Hummingbirds have emerged over the years, such as Franki, Mavely, Mavn, and Soci, but Hummingbirds sets itself apart by targeting content creators primarily located in Middle America. The platform operates in over 20 cities, including Des Moines, Iowa; Madison, Wisconsin; Nashville, Tennessee; and Omaha, Nebraska.
This focus is strategic, as the company believes that this region is often overlooked and challenging for many brands aiming to expand their reach.
“They don’t know how to market to Middle America. [Customers are] spending a significant amount on groceries, and so they’re able to activate our Hummingbird communities in order to build brand awareness and move product velocity. It’s been really beneficial that we focus on a part of their marketing that is a little bit more challenging for them,” Flynn explained.
Co-founder Emily Steele is the visionary behind Hummingbirds. As a small content creator in Iowa, she recognized the opportunity to assist brands in reaching her community.
“Hummingbirds spun out of trying an oat milk latte in Des Moines, Iowa, and sharing it on social and getting other people excited to share the small businesses in our own city,” Steele told us. She also mentioned that the company name comes from a nickname her father-in-law calls her, as hummingbirds are the “local pollinators” and are always “buzzing around town.”
Recently, the company has experienced rapid growth. In the past year, it claims to have quadrupled its revenue and doubled its community size, now boasting 11,000 creators.
Participants in the seed round include Allos Ventures, Ground Game, Homegrown Capital, InnoVenture Iowa Fund, ISA Ventures, M25 Fund, and Next Level Ventures."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/dropbox-is-laying-off-20-of-its-staff/,Dropbox is laying off 20% of its staff | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-30,"Dropbox is laying off 20% of its workforce as the cloud company undergoes what CEO Drew Houston calls a “transitional period.”
In a letter to staff, Houston said that the reduction in headcount would impact 528 people. The goal, he added, was to make cuts in areas where Dropbox has “over-invested” while designing a “flatter, more efficient” team structure.
“As CEO, I take full responsibility for this decision and the circumstances that led to it, and I’m truly sorry to those impacted by this change,” he wrote. “This market is moving fast and investors are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into this space. This both validates the opportunity we’ve been pursuing and underscores the need for even more urgency, even more aggressive investment, and decisive action.”
According to a filing with the SEC, Dropbox estimates it’ll lay out total cash expenditures of $63 million to $68 million on the layoffs, primarily in the form of severance and benefits, and recognize $47 million to $52 million of incremental expense. Most of the payouts will occur in Q4 2024, with the remainder to be recognized in H1 2025.
Affected employees will receive severance, equity, and transition payments, as well as certain healthcare benefits and job placement services.
Dropbox has struggled to grow in recent months, losing market share to rivals, including Box and Google Drive. In its most recent fiscal quarter, the company added only 63,000 new users — a fraction of its roughly 18 million user base — while revenue growth slid to the low single digits.
In Q2, Dropbox saw the lowest quarter for growth in its history: 1.9% year-over-year growth to $634.5 million. As of August, the company’s shares had lost more than 20% of their value year to date.
“We continue to see softening demand and macro headwinds in our core business,” Houston wrote. “While I’m proud of the progress we’ve made in the last couple years, in some parts of the business, we’re still not delivering at the level our customers deserve or performing in line with industry peers.”
The layoffs come a year after Dropbox let go of roughly 500 employees — and as the company increasingly invests in AI technologies. Dropbox recently expanded its AI-powered smart organization and search tool, Dropbox Dash, with enterprise-focused features, including data governance controls.
In his letter, Houston said that Dropbox plans to share more details on high-level changes and its 2025 strategy in the coming days."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/kindle-colorsoft-review-a-subtle-approach-to-color/,Amazon Kindle Colorsoft review: A muted approach to color | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-30,"October was an exciting month for reading devices. We got a new iPad mini, a couple of products from Boox, and this strange yet compelling iPhone e-reader adapter from Astropad. The biggest splash of all, however, came from Amazon. It’s unsurprising, as the retail giant commands around 80% of the devoted e-reader market.
The past month belies the overall state of the industry. E-readers are one of the quieter mainstream consumer electronics categories. This is due in no small part to Amazon’s domination. With no competitors positioned to challenge the company’s throne, refreshes have taken on an increasingly sporadic cadence.
This year, however, Amazon is greeting the holiday season with the largest Kindle refresh in recent memory. The large-form Scribe has been updated with improved note-taking capabilities and AI-based text summaries. The bestselling Paperwhite is getting a bigger display and faster processor. The base Kindle’s page turns have sped up, and the device has gotten a brighter front light and more color options.
All of these relatively minor refreshes were overshadowed by a new edition to the line. After 16 years of Kindles, many of us had given up on the notion of color. But color e-paper has become a reality in recent years. Notably, the Kindle’s chief competitor, Kobo, released the Libra Colour in April.
E-paper is the heart of these devices, and adding that extra layer never seemed like a priority for Amazon. If people wanted color, they could simply buy a tablet and deal with the shorter battery life and a display that’s harsher on the eyes.
One key thing that makes the Colorsoft so intriguing is that it’s still a Kindle in the truest sense. The device shares far more common DNA with the Paperwhite than any Fire tablet. In fact, the reader could have just as appropriately been branded the Kindle Paperwhite Color.
In fact, the addition of color comes courtesy of a secondary layer added to the e-paper stack. It’s based on E Ink’s Kaleido color filter, albeit custom built for the Kindle line. The result lives up to the Colorsoft name. I would describe it as subtle — pale even. In fact, if you’re not looking directly at the display, you might miss the fact that it’s a color model.
Amazon compares the reading experience to print. Certainly the result is easier on the eyes than color reproduction on, say, an iPad. The effect is nice for colors and highlighted passages. If you’re primarily a prose reader, you won’t encounter the feature all that much. If you’re looking for a device for, say, comics, the color may be a bit muted for your taste.
The long-awaited addition of color unfortunately serves as a stark reminder of Comixology’s sunsetting under the Amazon corporate umbrella. Between that app and a color Kindle, the company had the opportunity to really own the space — though, notably, e-paper’s refresh rate is less than ideal for the kind of dynamism Comixology brought to the form.
For the most part, tablets will hew a bit closer to the original art. Colorsoft’s reproductions are akin to reading the Sunday funnies. The color filter brings to mind the CMYK printing process used in newspaper printing. The effect is enhanced by the fact that the Kindle display is more of a grayish hue than the full white you get with a tablet or phone.
Beyond the color display, the Paperwhite Signature Edition and Colorsoft are strikingly similar. Both now sport 7-inch displays with a 300 ppi density. Both devices have the same footprint, measuring 5 x 7 x .3 inches, with a fully flush display, though the Colorsoft weighs a hair more at 7.7 ounces (the Paperwhite Signature is 7.5 ounces). You likely won’t notice the difference.
Both products come with 32GB of storage by default; that’s double the storage of the standard Paperwhite and base Kindle. The new Scribe has 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB options. The USB-C connector has been standardized across the line, though only the Signature Paperwhite and Colorsoft have wireless charging — something I don’t imagine being a dealbreaker for most. While the two Paperwhite models, the base Kindle, and the new Scribe all have different body colors, the Colorsoft, ironically, only comes in black.
It makes sense that Amazon used the Paperwhite as the basis for Colorsoft. It is, as noted above, the bestselling Kindle, straddling the fence between the base and Scribe models. The premium Oasis — to which I was always partial — has been phased out. I’m a bit sad to see it go, but Amazon hadn’t updated the thing in five years. Likely most consumers simply didn’t care enough about a premium e-reader.
One spot where the Paperwhite has the upper hand is battery life. The Colorsoft is listed at “up to eight weeks” to the Paperwhite’s “up to 12 weeks.” Once you get into the realm of multiple months on a charge, the difference gets fairly moot. You just need to set aside 2.5 hours somewhere in there to fully charge them.
The Paperwhite wins on price as well. At $280, the Colorsoft has edged into that premium e-reader category, priced roughly the same as the Oasis. The Paperwhite and Signature Paperwhite run $160 and $200, respectively. The new base Kindle starts at $110, and the Scribe is tough to swallow at $400.
It’s nice to know that the Kindle line has life in it yet. Color, the feature we’ve waited a decade and a half for, is finally here. As for whether it’s worth $80 more than the Signature Paperwhite, it’s a far more subtle distinction than the price difference implies, especially when most of the time you spend reading text will be the standard Kindle monotone experience. Still, the device benefits from several generations of improvement, offering an overall great reading experience — even if color still feels like a bit of a novelty."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/apple-will-buy-renewable-power-for-its-mac-mini-users/,Apple will buy renewable power for its Mac mini users | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-10-30,"With its new miniaturized Mac mini, Apple has a second product — and its first Mac — that qualifies for its “carbon neutral” label. As part of the push, the company is buying enough renewable power to offset emissions generated from customer use of the computers.
For years, tech companies have been tracking, and in some cases reducing, the emissions profiles of their products. Usually that involves querying suppliers about their own supply chains, where they get power to run their operations, and how they’ll be shipping finished products. But in 2023, with the Apple Watch Series 9, the Cupertino-based company made the unorthodox decision to eliminate emissions from product use by making additional investments in renewable power.
Powering something like a smartwatch represents a tiny fraction of the overall carbon footprint of the device; things like chips, displays, and batteries contribute far more to the total.
But with a product like the Mac mini, using the device can generate far more pollution than charging a watch. It’s also a larger fraction of the device’s overall carbon footprint.
Shrinking the Mac mini also likely helped keep the footprint down, though it’s impossible to tell since Apple doesn’t break out specific figures for things like materials and manufacturing in its environmental declarations.
What is notable, though, is how semiconductors contribute to a computer’s climate impact. Semiconductor manufacturing is energy intensive and uses chemicals that have significantly higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide. Making and shipping the base model Mac mini, which has 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, generates 32 kg of carbon pollution, even after Apple accounts for its low-carbon power investments. The top spec version includes far more chips inside, providing 64GB of RAM and 8TB of storage, and that nearly quadruples the carbon footprint to 121 kg.
In the end, Apple says it zeros out those figures for any Mac mini by purchasing carbon credits from nature-based projects like sustainably managed forests and restored ecosystems. But the difference between the bottom and top specs reveals just how much carbon remains embedded in the computing industry, and just how hard the last bit will be to eliminate."

In a recent Gartner survey, 64% of consumers said that they’d prefer companies didn’t use AI of any kind — including chatbots — in their customer service. Fifty-three percent went so far as to say they’d weigh switching to a rival if a company considered replacing its human agents with AI.
Alex Levin, a former product manager at Thomson Reuters and the ex-SVP of growth at Handy, believes most people hate chatbots because they’ve had bad experiences in the past.
“Contact center teams are often given only cost-reduction goals, forcing them to move to low-quality deflection or terrible deterministic bots,” he told TechCrunch. ” At Handy, I was continuously frustrated by legacy contact center software, most of which was created before the cloud even existed and required an army of developers and IT admins to maintain.”
Levin felt chatbots could deliver compelling experiences, however, when powered by the right mix of technologies. So he teamed up with Rebecca Greene, who he met at Handy, where she was chief product officer, to start Regal, which builds AI-powered contact center solutions.
“As operators, we wanted to move fast, make quick changes, do A/B tests, and operate the contact center the way we saw our colleagues doing in marketing and product,” Levin said.
Regal offers phone- and text-based chatbots that can field common customer service requests. The chatbots can handle things like interruptions without breaking the flow of a conversation, and adjust their verbiage depending on a customer’s sentiment (e.g., apologizing if a customer is upset).
Brands can customize the language Regal’s chatbots use, set guardrails, and have the chatbots pull in data like a customer’s birthday, name, and conversation history to make chats more engaging.
Regal’s chatbots can also take certain actions — acting as “AI agents,” if you will. For example, the chatbots can send out text or email follow-ups, schedule next-step calls, and transfer to a human agent if the conversation needs to be escalated.
With the market for call center AI bots expected to be worth over $10 billion by 2032, it’s not entirely surprising that Regal has plenty of competition. Got It AI is developing a “fully autonomous” contact center; Cognigy provides a platform to build call center workflow automations; and OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor’s Sierra is focusing on chatbots for customer service functions.
Levin says he’s pleased with Regal’s growth so far, though.
“Millions of people worldwide engage with their favorite brands — like Google, Kin, Toyota, AAA, and Ro — monthly through Regal,” he said. “We believe that 10 years from now, most contact center interactions will be autonomous. So we’re all in.”
Regal claims to have hundreds of customers, and this month it closed a $40 million investment round from Emergence Capital, Founder Collective, and Homebrew. The round brings Regal’s total raised to $83 million and will be used for product development and growing Regal’s 100-person, New York-based team."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/archon-emerges-from-stealth-with-20m-and-antibody-cages-to-power-up-drug-development/,Archon emerges from stealth with $20M and 'antibody cages' to power up drug development | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-30,"Archon Biosciences, a biotech startup putting AI to work designing novel biomolecules, has just emerged from stealth with an impressive $20 million in seed funding. The company aims to supercharge antibody treatments using specially designed protein “cages” that multiply their effects, opening up new opportunities in drug development.
The company was spun out of Baker Lab, the University of Washington research outfit overseen by pioneering computational biologist and recent Nobel Prize winner David Baker. His team’s work on generative protein design using AI and other means has been foundational in the fast-evolving industry, and Archon is taking a specific aspect of it to market.
One shortcoming of antibody treatments (and research into effective treatments) is that, like all molecular biology, the process depends a bit on chance. It’s difficult to control how much an antibody or protein actually binds to its target on a cell or other surface.
What Archon’s antibody cages, or AbCs, do (as documented in this paper published in Science) is offer a scaffold for modifying and multiplying their effectiveness. A free-floating antibody may have only a small chance of binding to a target protein, but if you were to stick a dozen of them together in a big dodecahedron, that significantly and perhaps profoundly improves that chance.
This may be the difference between being able to tell if a medication works or not.
“There are many high-profile cases where we understand not only a target’s biology but also why past attempts to drug the target have failed in the clinic. These key disease levers are at our fingertips, but we lack the tools to safely and effectively engage them,” explained James Lazarovits, co-founder and CEO of Archon, in a press release. “We have developed a proprietary protein design platform coupled with rapid in-house manufacturing and testing to revolutionize how biologics are developed.”
The startup’s protein design platform uses the generative protein creation and simulation tools created at and licensed from Baker Lab, and the resulting AbCs could have a variety of effects. And they don’t need any exotic manufacturing methods — if you can produce proteins and antibodies at scale, you can probably make AbCs too.
The $20 million round was led by Madrona Ventures with participation from DUMAC Inc., Sahsen Ventures, WRF Capital, Pack Ventures, Alexandria Venture Investments, and Cornucopian Capital; it comes on top of some $7 million in grants from a number of institutes and government agencies.
Archon is, like UW and Baker Lab, based in Seattle. TechCrunch will be visiting soon to learn and share more about this promising spinout."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/tony-fadell-on-mission-driven-aholes-silicon-valley-entitlement-and-why-llms-are-know-it-alls/,"Tony Fadell on mission-driven a--holes, Silicon Valley entitlement and why LLMs are 'know-it-alls' | TechCrunch",Aisha Malik,2024-10-30,"Tony Fadell, the father of the iPod and founder of Nest, took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 on Tuesday to talk about how building the next generation of deep tech startups requires mission-driven a–holes. The entrepreneur and investor did not hold back onstage as he called out Silicon Valley for its entitlement and dunked on large language models (LLMs) being “know-it-alls,” earning a wave of laughs and applause across the fully packed auditorium.
Fadell explained why he believes “mission-driven a–holes are a good thing, and in fact, needed to create and ship world-class technology products.
“People work with people who are very difficult, and those are the ones that create and change the world. But there are two types of a–holes. Everybody’s an a–hole, but you gotta understand why,” Fadell said. “If they’re an a–hole, because it’s their ego, they’re trying to push people down, that is an egocentric a–hole. But if you are an a–hole on the details, you’re sitting there pushing on the details, you’re not criticizing the people, but you are critiquing their work and saying you can do better, that is a mission-driven a–hole.”
Fadell thinks it’s not a bad thing when someone is keen on the details and makes sure their team is getting things right. He believes that focusing on details is what you need to make great products, and when you have a manager who cares, that’s a good thing.
The entrepreneur and investor also called out Silicon Valley for its entitlement, making a joke about how startups aren’t hiring Googlers because “you’re lucky that they even showed up.”
“They just showed up on a bus, and they came in for lunch, and then took the bus home,” Fadell said. “They say, ‘I worked today, I’m getting a massage, oh, where’s the yogurt?’ That’s why I don’t like any of our startups hiring most Googlers because they’ve got this culture thing.”
He noted that during his days at General Magic in the ’90s, the team decided they weren’t going to hire people from the East Coast because of their demands.
“We said, we will never hire people from the East Coast,” Fadell said. “So this was IBM and Sperry and all that s— because they had to have their driver, or they had to have their company car, and they had to have their corporate lunch and their special executive toilet. We’re like we’re never hiring any of these people. It’s just not going to work; it’s a culture clash. And now I wake up today and Silicon Valley has turned into that s—, and I’m like get me the f— out of here, yeah? Entitlement everywhere!”
Fadell then went on to call out LLMs for being know-it-alls, joking that no one wants to hire a know-it-all. He believes LLMs are great for certain things, but they can’t be adopted across the board.
He believes LLMs can be great for entertainment, like if you’re asking ChatGPT to write you a funny poem. However, Fadell says that since LLMs are prone to hallucinations, they shouldn’t be used in cases where people could be at risk. For instance, he thinks doctors shouldn’t be using ChatGPT to create patient reports because people could be harmed if treatment plans are entered incorrectly or drugs are misnamed.
“If you look at artificial-specific models, they work really well,” Fadell said. “They don’t hallucinate, but LLMs are trying to be this general thing because we’re trying to make science fiction happen.”"

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/mdc-is-building-a-surgical-robot-that-operates-inside-an-mri/,MDC is building a surgical robot that operates inside an MRI | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-29,"MRIs are an indispensable tool for surgeons, though the technology certainly has its limitations. Take, for instance, surgeons using the machines to guide their procedures. The current process entails putting the patient into a machine to get an image, before pulling them out to advance a needle one centimeter at a time. It’s a time-consuming and frankly inefficient use of resources.
Boasting the tagline “Creating a new chapter in minimally invasive surgery,” Bay Area-based MDC believes the answer lies in robotics. While robotics undoubtedly represent the future of surgery, they present their own challenges in this application. After all, traditional robotics contain many elements that cannot operate inside an MRI.
The company pitched on the Startup Battlefield stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024.
MDC’s challenge, then, was creating a robotic system that could operate on a patient inside an MRI without relying on electric motors, rare earth metals and other elements that would inhibit the imaging machine’s operations.
The young startup’s work is built upon research conducted during founder and CEO Sam Frishman’s time at John Hopkins and Stanford. Frishman describes the solution as “high stiffness, low friction hydraulic transmissions and actuators.” The system is powered by water and tethered to the outside of the MRI through a tube.
“Our system has a few differentiators,” Frishman tells TechCrunch. “One is the ability to have really dexterous control directly by the physician. They’re controlling the needle, whether it’s positioning, advancing, actuating — it’s like they’re holding it in their hand.”
MDC is specifically targeting biopsies and ablations in its initial offering. The CEO says those minimally invasive procedures are just the start.
“Really, it’s enabling new capabilities that are beyond what is possible today,” says Frishman. “That’s where the digitization, the power assist, the guidance through AI and all of the data we gather, you start having beyond human capabilities added, though the physician is still fully in control and making all of the decisions.”
MDC is a recent graduate of SOSV’s HAX accelerator, and pitched onstage today as part of the Startup Battlefield at Disrupt. The firm has raised $1.2 million in pre-seed money."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/ashton-kutchers-sound-ventures-backs-fei-fei-lis-world-labs-in-continued-ai-push/,Ashton Kutcher's Sound Ventures backs Fei-Fei Li's World Labs in continued AI push | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-10-29,"Ashton Kutcher’s VC firm, Sound Ventures, co-led by general partners Guy Oseary and Effie Epstein, is betting on AI — including with an investment in Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs, the investors confirmed onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 on Tuesday.
The startup, founded by Li, the Stanford professor dubbed the “Godmother of AI,” has already raised $230 million from investors including a16z, NEA, and Radical Ventures, valuing the company at over $1 billion. It aims to develop “large world models” that will be able to understand and interact with the 3D world and is targeting game companies and movie studios as its first customers — the latter an area where a Hollywood actor-turned-investor could have input.
Announced last year, Sound Ventures’ $265 million AI fund has invested in various large language model and AI companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Stability AI, and Magic.dev.
Of note, Kutcher said today that the firm hasn’t yet sold any of its OpenAI shares — a confirmation that these investors believe the company will continue to get even bigger.
The team is also interested in startups working to bring AI technology to a new physical form factor or possibly, a new OS.
“I don’t know that the existing form factors that we have, or the existing operating systems that we have for hardware are optimized for [AI], but so we’re really curious about the space,” said Oseary.
He mentioned that Sound Ventures had met with Humane, the makers of the Ai pin, two years ago, and had invested in Rabbit, the AI hardware startup co-founded by Jesse Lyu.
“The reason we got really excited about what Jesse was building is because of the Large Action Model component. So we actually look at the hardware as almost being irrelevant over time — the form factor didn’t matter,” explained Epstein, speaking about Sound Ventures’ interest in the combination of AI and hardware.
“Maybe today it looks like a dongle that kind of looks like your phone, but tomorrow it looks like something else, and eventually it’s irrelevant,” she continued. “But this software is… learning our preferences and can take action on our behalf. And in fact, there’s a moment in time where a company like that could actually be founded and potentially disrupt a player like Apple,” Epstein said.
“It was less of a hardware play for us. We really looked at it as investing in another foundation model,” she added.
The VC firm is also interested in investing in the new AI device being built by legendary Apple designer Jony Ive, in collaboration with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.
In fact, Kutcher said that they had “had a conversation with Jony today,” though TechCrunch understands a term sheet has not yet been signed.
“Somebody’s going to have a breakthrough in this space and it’s going to be really helpful and really profound for all of us,” said Kutcher."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/haptics-touch-based-navigation-helps-blind-and-sighted-alike-get-around-without-looking/,Haptic's touch-based navigation helps blind and sighted alike get around without looking | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-29,"Smartphones and navigation apps have become second nature these days. But for those with blindness and low vision, it’s not quite so convenient. Haptic has been building a non-visual, non-verbal way of telling people where to go, and they’ve decided it’s time to scale up and take it global.
Haptic presented onstage today as part of the Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, showing their progress from concept to prototype to platform. The company got started in 2017 when, after a friend lost their sight in an accident, co-founder and CEO Kevin Yoo and colleagues began looking into ways someone could navigate without using visual or auditory cues.
Though there are plenty of screen-reading options and spoken directions in apps, these options aren’t always convenient or practical. But as head of operations Enzo Caruso pointed out, there are other interfaces we could be using. Touch, for instance.
“Why not receive info in a more robust, intuitive, and accessible way? Everyone can understand the sensation of touch. It’s global, it’s worldwide, it’s universal,” he said.
The advance Haptic has made is a way of using vibration and other tactile sensations to communicate the simple, intuitive idea that the user is going in the right direction. Using the app or API, your device will send a steady pulse when you’re on track, then quicken or intensify if you veer off course; they call it a “haptic corridor,” and yes — it’s patented.
“HapticNav is fully patented, we hold the core fundamental technology for Systems and Methods for Haptic Navigation,” said Yoo on stage.
Though it’s hard to imagine, it’s intuitive enough to get after just a few seconds; I tested it in person and found it quite easy to get a handle on.
The advantages of the approach are plentiful: It works in any language, requires no special hardware, and can be used to direct someone down a crowded city sidewalk, an open landscape, or even inside a building (though that part is still in development).
Originally this haptic corridor was communicated through a wearable of their own, but since then the company has embraced the progress made in the market.
“Technology advances while you’re advancing — and smartwatches got better. So, do you want to be in competition with the Googles and Apples out there… or do you want to have them as allies? You can take your SDK from thousands of users to billions of users,” said Caruso.
Yoo explained that this year marked the company’s change in focus from proving out the product to putting it in as many hands as possible. A partnership with the likes of Google or Uber would certainly go a long way toward doing that.
Imagine, he said, not having to even take your phone out of your pocket to walk straight to your Uber at the airport, or finding your way through a crowded venue by the pulse of your smartwatch. Anyone might find that useful, in addition to people with vision impairments for whom it may be an everyday navigation tool. It’s also a way to improve compliance with existing and incoming accessibility requirements, Yoo noted.
Here’s one user, James, getting around his neighborhood with the help of the app, HapticNav:
“Google and Apple, telecoms, Uber, governments… all of this is coming together into a common ground,” said Yoo. With the capabilities of today’s smartwatches and phones, combined with a new software focus at Haptic on “hyper-accurate location,” they hope to introduce indoor navigation and integration with other services.
Haptic currently partners with Waymap, Cooley, WID, and Infinite Access, and are in talks with many more. They also just landed a new contract with Aira, an app that allows people with vision impairments to get live assistance from a sighted helper via their phone. The haptic navigation would reduce the need for that assistant to give step-by-step directions, instead just dropping pins on a map or providing other services.
This, and not monetizing their own app, is how they intend to make money, Yoo emphasized: “We have a free app available to the world, live in 31 countries right now… and we have the licensing and integration model — that’s the business.”
The company is mid-raise and hoping to close a funding round that will let them pursue bigger partners (the Ubers and T-Mobiles of the world) in earnest."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/ashton-kutcher-explains-why-hes-betting-on-ai-but-not-trying-to-pick-a-winner/,"Ashton Kutcher explains why he's betting on AI, but not trying to pick a 'winner' | TechCrunch",Aisha Malik,2024-10-29,"Ashton Kutcher, co-founder of Sound Ventures, believes that every company is going to become an AI company, but that there might not be a winner in the space.
The actor and investor spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 on Tuesday alongside Sound co-founder Guy Oseary and partner Effie Epstein to detail what the firm is looking for in founders and startups, and how they believe foundational AI companies are setting the stage for the future.
“Foundation-layer AI companies are going to be some of the most valuable companies that have ever been created in the history of humankind,” Kutcher said.
He said it’s easy to underestimate how big of a deal AI is, and that he believes foundational AI models are going to be the foundation of everything to come.
“There will not be a company in the world that is not, in some way, shape, or form, using AI in the future,” Kutcher said. “So every company is going to be an AI company. And it’s our thesis that whether it’s open source AI, whether it’s closed systems like Anthropic or OpenAI or World Labs, or whether you’re building software using Magic.dev, those things are going to be the underpinnings of everything else.”
However, he doesn’t think there will be a winner in the space. He believes that while foundational AI companies converge in some ways, they are also differentiating.
“Sometimes you can get too smart and too cute and think that you can pick the winner, and there might not be a winner,” Kutcher said. “It might not be in one of these monopoly spaces, because there’s a lot of different people that stand to gain a lot from AI and AGI in general.”
While some people fear AI, Kutcher says everyone should be excited about the potential that the technology brings.
“I think a lot of people were afraid of the personal computer when it first came out, and I think a lot of people were afraid of the car when it first came out, and a lot of people were afraid of the industrial world revolution when it happened,” Kutcher said. “And I think this next level of innovation for humans, that humans should be very excited about the potential, because I think we’re all going to be capable of doing much more than we’ve been capable of doing historically.”
Kutcher and Sound have been betting big on AI, as the firm launched a $265 million AI fund last year to invest in large language model companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Hugging Face.
The actor, who has known OpenAI CEO Sam Altman since he founded Loopt, shared that Altman was fine with Sound investing in several different AI companies.
“We do a really good job of maintaining silos of information, not sharing outside of the companies and not sharing across the companies,” Kutcher said. “And we just had a sense that we believed in this space.”
Kutcher noted that Sound hasn’t taken money off the table with OpenAI, which is now worth $157 billion.
Kutcher also took time to share his advice for founders and advised them not to focus too much time on their deck, noting that he and the other Sound partners don’t remember OpenAI’s deck.
“It’s about the people and the humans that are in the building, that are building it, and the competencies that they have and why they’re gonna win, and the market thesis and what the insight is, that is the breakthrough,” he said. “It’s not the deck. Like stop spending so much time on the deck.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/gecko-materials-wants-to-sell-you-the-next-velcro/,Gecko Materials wants to sell you the next Velcro | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-29,"It looks fake, or at least like a good illusion: There’s Gecko Materials founder Dr. Capella Kerst dangling a full wine bottle from her pinky finger, the only thing keeping it from smashing to pieces being the super-strong dry-adhesive her startup has brought to market.
But it’s no trick. It’s the result of years of academic research that Kerst, who holds a PhD in mechanical engineering from Stanford University, built on by inventing a method to mass-manufacture the adhesive. Inspired by the way real-life gecko feet grip surfaces, you could think of it like a new Velcro — except it only needs one side, leaves no residue, and can detach as quickly as it attaches. It can do this at least 120,000 times and, as Kerst noted in a recent interview with TechCrunch, can stay attached for seconds, minutes, or even years.
Kerst has spent the last few years giving this magic trick-style demo any and everywhere: At VC happy hours, during pitch meetings, and on TikTok and Instagram Reels. And it works. Not just mechanically, but as a method of quickly captivating investors and customers. Gecko Materials raised a $2 million seed round in 2021 in less than 36 hours, and boasts Ford, Pacific Gas & Electric, and even NASA as early customers.
Yes, before Kerst makes her pitch on the Startup Battlefield stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, Gecko Materials’ adhesive has already been to space.
The adhesive is incredibly strong. One square-inch tile of it can hold 15 pounds, vertically, while six of them is enough to pull a car. It works by leveraging van der Waals forces, which involves interactions at the intermolecular level.
It can be complicated to understand, so Kerst likes to lean on what Gecko’s material is not.
“It’s not excretion, it’s not tape, it’s not glue, it’s not micro-hooks,” Kerst explained. It doesn’t require an electrical charge of any kind. It’s also not based on suction, which is what some other companies that promise gecko-like adhesive tend to use, Kerst wryly noted. Suction-based methods create concentrations of force, she said, meaning force is applied unevenly, potentially causing fractures or leaving debris behind.
Really, she said, Gecko’s material is more like micro hairs that are 1/100th of the size of a hair on a person’s head. When applied to a smooth or semi-smooth surface, they pull down and “shear” to create “an extremely strong force.” Pull in the opposite direction at anything more than 20 degrees relative to the plane of that shear and it detaches in milliseconds.
This makes it possible to uniformly load the force and, just as importantly, uniformly disengage the force, which means it can be used for very delicate objects like quartz wafers, glass, solar panels, or even food items like eggs and rotten tomatoes.
So far that has meant it is a great material for robots or drones that do lots of picking and placing, which is one reason Gecko Material has found early success with manufacturers.
“We’re eliminating the traditional pitfalls of adhesives,” Kerst said.
The wine bottle demo is emblematic of how Kerst wants to approach mass-manufacturing Gecko Materials adhesive. It’s simple, but impactful. The demo “gets people’s ideas flowing,” Kerst told TechCrunch. “We’re a public benefit corp., so we are for-profit, but I want to help people save energy, time, and money, and just bring back innovation in the hardware space.”
It’s such a tempting product to fiddle with that, in a recent interview with YouTube show The Pitch, she had a prospective investor ready to pony up $1,200 on the spot to take a piece home. (In part, funnily enough, so the investor could show it to some magician friends.)
Getting that cost down is a goal as Gecko Material scales production, Kerst admits. The current cost is roughly 10 times more than other common adhesive options like 3M’s command strips. But Gecko Material already has software-like gross profit margins of more than 80% on the material, and Kerst is quick to point out that 3M command strips can only really be used once.
Gecko Material already generated more than $700,000 in revenue in 2023, and Kerst said the company has a “clear path” with its current paying customers to do $75 million in annual recurring revenue in five years. It’s also in the process of raising another round of funding to scale operations.
“I’m really passionate about being able to make local manufacturing more sustainable and bring that around the world,” Kerst said. She also does not shy from the Velcro comparisons. “I do see a pathway in which Gecko Materials is like a household name, a worldwide name. Obviously, we’re already a space-wide name,” she smiled."

ForceField is building a set of “patent-pending” APIs dubbed MARQ, the first of which is designed to authenticate content.
For context, a 2022 report from European law enforcement agency Europol predicted that 90% of all online content will be AI-generated by 2026. The internet is already awash with manipulated content — either entirely machine-generated, or made with the help of AI — forcing big tech companies to develop new tools to address the problem. Google last month announced that it will soon begin flagging AI-generated images in its search engine, following in the footsteps of Meta, which was already doing so on Facebook and Instagram — though with questionable accuracy.
YouTube, meanwhile, now allows people to request the removal of content that simulates their face or voice.
The issue of “fake” content isn’t going away, and it’s a problem that has given rise to a swathe of startups that are tackling the problem through various means, such as Clarity, Reality Defender, and Truepic, which have all raised sizeable sums from big-name backers in recent years.
ForceField, for its part, is focusing on the device level rather than the content — this means any data stream, on any device, where ForceField’s technology is present. This could be a mobile app with ForceField’s API integrated, or a surveillance camera’s video-management system or drone’s hardware — it can “sign and hash for verification” in real-time.
ForceField’s first product, called HashMarq, verifies content submissions and labels it as authentic, replete with a badge of authenticity. Rather than using tangential techniques such as adversarial AI (i.e. fighting AI with AI) or watermarking, Forcefield’s technology establishes a “chain of custody” to establish provenance by figuring out whether a specific piece of content has been altered — it does so by looking at metadata from data streams and connected devices. What we’re talking about here is blockchain technology, though ForceField founder and CEO MC Spano (pictured above) stresses that this isn’t a “web3” startup.
“We’re leveraging blockchain, we’re not using coins or crypto — we’re not a web3 company,” Spano told TechCrunch. “We’re using blockchain in the most innate and purposeful way, which is smart contracting. We authenticate anything collected, like a video, photo, an audio file, a screenshot on a mobile device — but we also secure and authenticate any multimedia collected on any IoT, which means anything from a BlackBerry to a robot. But any streaming data as it’s collected, we’re signing it, we’re hashing it, and then we’re using ledger technology.”
These “smart contracts” live on the blockchain (though ForceField doesn’t reveal which one) to ensure their security, transparency, and immutability — they can’t be changed. Enterprise customers — which may include anyone from chief information officers to trust and safety teams — can access the technology through an API or SDK which they integrate into their own applications. So HashMarq basically serves as a digital certificate for content that has passed its proof checks.
“We’re building tech for the good guys — we’re anticipating that the market, meaning governments, enterprises, small companies, even individuals, will need to prove what they’re putting out in the world is real,” Spano said. “This is compared to something like what Meta and other companies are doing, where they’re basically labeling something that’s generated by AI.”
So what, exactly, does ForceField’s technology look at when assessing the veracity of a given asset?
“We’re looking at about 90 proof points, but I can’t share all of them,” Spano said. “The notion is that we’re looking at the geospatial intelligence around that device, what was around at the time, what signals, what other devices, and the time. What time was this device, specifically, collecting this video? And how long was it from the collection to the submission? Those points alone can tell journalists or news organizations or law enforcement so much more than what they would originally have, and it also can pinpoint a geographic location.”
Though ForceField formally came to fruition in 2021, Spano says the genesis for the product came in 2018 when she was assaulted in New York City, and subsequently faced major obstacles both in gathering and submitting the evidence required by law enforcement.
“I knew that there were cameras, I knew that the evidence was able to be gathered,” Spano said. “But when I dealt with NYPD to get the evidence, they wouldn’t get a subpoena — so I had to go to the owner of the camera myself to request the footage. I recorded it with my phone, and when I turned that recording into NYPD, they said it wasn’t admissible. And that’s when I realized the justice system starts way earlier than in the courts.”
And this gets to the crux of the problem that Spano and ForceField are trying to solve — a problem that has become even greater in the age of generative AI, where anyone with a laptop is able to create plausible, but entirely fake, “evidence.”
It is still early days, but ForceField is developing a proof-of-concept (PoC) with insurance giant Erie, while Spano says the company also has letters of intent signed with three additional customers, with plans to finalize the PoC and launch commercially in Q1 2025.
While insurance will be a big market for ForceField at first, Spano says that with the advent of AI and the ability for pretty much anyone to create authentic-looking assets, there’s no real limits on the industries in which it can apply to. A citizen journalist, for example, who has captured a video on their mobile device, could submit it to a news station, which would integrate with ForceField’s API to determine the authenticity of the source data. Law enforcement, too, could use the technology to verify witness or victim submissions.
In terms of financing, the company has so far been funded via a mixture of bootstrapping (Spano sold a previous company) and capital provided by angels, including actor Debra Messing, as well as Wilfredo Fernandez, X’s head of government affairs and a scout at VC firm Lightspeed. ForceField has also received money through its participation in Techstars last year, while it’s just taken on its first institutional funding via a strategic investment from its customer, Erie Insurance.
Spano also said that she hopes to close a seed round by the end of the year, adding that she believes one of the most important facets of the company is that it is an entirely woman-led company in a very male-dominated space.
“There’s a really big issue with funding solo women teams here in the U.S.,” Spano said. “I am the only woman building this type of technology right now, every other competitor are all led by men — so having a woman’s voice, and transparency, and honesty, and truth… is really important.”"

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/banfs-smart-tires-for-trucks-promise-to-save-fuel-and-lives/,BANF’s smart tires for trucks promise to save fuel and lives | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-10-29,"Tire health has a huge impact on a truck’s fuel efficiency and safety on the road.
And yet, with all of the arguably sexier solutions out there offering driver assist features and self-driving software, tires don’t get the attention they deserve. At least, so says Ron Lee, the head of business development at BANF, a startup that builds hardware and software to monitor tire health.
Korea-based BANF, which stands for Begin A New Feature, uses sensors to collect data on tire pressure, temperature, tread wear, wheel alignment, and even lug nut stability. That data is analyzed using machine learning to provide drivers and fleet managers with insights about not only tire health, but also cargo load measurement and road surface conditions. Lee says BANF’s insights are up to 90% accurate, and are useful to everyone from fleet management companies to OEMs to departments of transportation.
“Tires are the sole point of contact with the road,” Lee told TechCrunch. “We’re not saying that we’re replacing vision-based methodologies of capturing potholes or road conditions, but we’re more of a complementary solution. We are more accurate at capturing road coefficient and also the depths of potholes, which is one of the key indexes that road management needs to know because they have limited budgets, so they have to know where to prioritize.”
The four-year-old startup, which has operations in Korea and China and plans to launch in Texas, is coming online at a time when autonomous trucks are gaining a foothold on highways.
“Autonomous vehicles, their aim is to run 24/7 to maximize profit, which means more tire stress,” Lee said, noting that electric vehicles are also heavier due to their batteries, which can wear down tires. “Tire data will be even more important in the future.”
Tire incumbents have embraced smart tire tech in recent years, and they’ve found customers in AV startups. May Mobility and Kodiak Robotics both rely on Bridgestone’s in-wheel sensors and predictive algorithms for tire-health monitoring, and Gatik relies on Goodyear’s road-friction detection technology. Bridgestone invested in startup Tyrata, a tire sensor and data management company, in 2022, and Goodyear-backed Tactile Mobility, which uses virtual sensors and cloud computing to estimate tire grip, in 2021.
BANF, which is competing in the TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 Startup Battlefield, has a somewhat different solution from others in the industry. The main piece of its hardware offering is a “triaxis” sensor that’s mounted to the inner liner of the tire and measures motion and forces along the X-axis, or length of the truck, like acceleration or deceleration; captures Y-axis side-to-side movement, like when the truck is turning or swerving; and measures the Z-axis, or up-and-down motion, of the truck, like bumps and road vibrations.
The sensor also has pressure and temperature sensors, and can send raw data via Bluetooth to the next bit of hardware in BANF’s stack, the “smart profiler.”
The profiler acts as a transmitter, receiver, and charger all in one. It attaches to the truck’s mud flap and is connected to the vehicle’s battery so it can provide wireless power and a continual power supply to the sensors. It also facilitates the transfer of sensor data to wherever the client wants to receive that data, whether that be telematic devices, fleet management devices, or even to the vehicle’s onboard system for real-time monitoring and analysis.
The whole system costs $50 per vehicle per month, says Lee. He also said BANF’s tech could save fleet owners up to $4,500 per truck annually on fuel consumption and tire maintenance.
BANF is currently collaborating with Volvo Group, Hyundai Motor Group, and DHL on various projects. Lee says BANF’s tech is currently on 123 vehicles, including four passenger vehicles, with the rest on Class 8 trucks operating in Sweden, the U.S., India, Korea, and China.
The executive said BANF is working with major tire manufacturers in the U.S. to commercialize the startup’s tech via a profit-sharing agreement by the end of 2026.
BANF raised a $5 million pre-Series A last year, and is close to closing a $12 million Series A round, according to Lee. BANF aims to begin trading on Korea’s stock exchange at the end of 2027, and then try its hand at a U.S. Nasdaq IPO. But Lee said BANF is open to other exit opportunities.
“We have many exit options, and not just to the tire companies,” Lee said. “We could be very beneficial to commercial vehicle manufacturers to win over market share. And also fleet management companies, telematic device companies, even insurance companies.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/google-says-its-next-gen-ai-agents-wont-launch-until-2025-at-the-earliest/,Google says its next-gen AI agents won't launch until 2025 at the earliest | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-29,"Google won’t ship tech from Project Astra, its wide-ranging effort to build AI apps and “agents” for real-time, multimodal understanding, until next year at the earliest.
Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed the timeline in remarks during Google’s Q3 earnings call Tuesday. “[Google is] building out experiences where AI can see and reason about the world around you,” he said. “Project Astra is a glimpse of that future. We’re working to ship experiences like this as early as 2025.”
Project Astra, which Google demoed at its I/O developer conference in May 2024, encompasses a range of technologies, from smartphone apps that can recognize the world around them and answer related questions to AI assistants that can perform actions on a user’s behalf.
In a prerecorded demo during I/O, Google showed a Project Astra prototype answering questions about things within view of a smartphone’s camera, like which neighborhood a user might be in or the name of a part on a broken bicycle.
The Information reported this month that Google was planning to launch a consumer-focused agent experience as early as this December — one capable of purchasing a product, booking a flight, and other such chores. That now seems unlikely — unless the experience in question is divorced from Project Astra.
Anthropic recently became one of the first companies with a large generative AI model able to control apps and web browsers on a PC. But, illustrating how challenging building AI agents can be, Anthropic’s struggles with many basic tasks."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/aesthetic-launches-the-shazam-for-fashion/,Aesthetic launches the 'Shazam for fashion' | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-10-29,"Aesthetic, a new fashion company looking to be the “Shazam for clothes,” launched this week and is using AI to help people identify and shop for clothing they sourced on social media.
The fashion concierge, called Alma, makes it easy for people to buy clothes that might otherwise be hard to find. Say you see an outfit you like on Instagram. You send a link to the post in a direct message to the Aesthetic account on TikTok or Instagram. Alma responds with a link to view the content on the Aesthetic website, where consumers can shop the look or add it to a collection board called Lookbook.
“Our goal is to help users save, shop, and share their fashion inspiration without having to leave their favorite social apps,” said CEO LJ Northington.
Northington had been thinking about what he felt was the lack of innovative tech in e-commerce. Fresh out of college, Northington worked on a project for a well-respected creative director. After hearing the same complaint from the director he was working with, Northington started working on concepts for personal shopping but couldn’t quite find something that worked.
He took a step back and simply asked, “What’s the easiest way to learn someone’s aesthetic?” he told TechCrunch. “The answer was pretty simple: look at their social media feed.”
Northington is already thinking big for the app. Aesthetics have taken over pop culture, and he thinks his app can be used to help creators monetize their style. He says he’s talking with brands and record labels about how their artists can create their own Aesthetic pages so fans can shop their trends. Think of how everyone dressed up in silver for Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” tour or the neon green looks of Charli XCX’s Brat Summer.
He declined to state how much the company has raised so far, but says that Aesthetic has received investments from Slow Capital and Zeal Capital Partners.
The proprietary fashion AI/ML platform is being funded by the Google Cloud AI startup program.
“We’re using the money to get to profitability,” Northington said. “Luckily Google is helping us out with some of the larger AI items, so we’re able to run a pretty cost-efficient business.”
Before this, Northington worked in business development and strategy for Westbrook, the media company co-founded by Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith. He wanted to be an NFL player for most of his life, but at the same time, grew up watching his father’s entrepreneurial journey and saw the fulfillment it gave him. When Northington’s career in sports fell through, he thought the business world was the closest thing to becoming a professional athlete.
He also studied psychology at Harvard, which helped him gain a different perspective on consumer habits and motivation. “Building consumer tech in today’s world is a very psychological, philosophical endeavor,” he said. “Building a consumer app is basically one big social experiment.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/mary-barra-still-thinks-gm-will-make-an-av-with-no-steering-wheel/,Mary Barra still thinks GM will make an AV with no steering wheel | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-29,"General Motors CEO Mary Barra still believes an autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel and pedals is “definitely” in her company’s future, despite recently suspending work on the purpose-built Origin.
Barra told the crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 on Tuesday that she still has an eye on a robotaxi with no steering wheel but that she made the call to kill the Origin after an exhausting, years-long attempt to change the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS).
“I’ve probably been working on it for six, seven years now,” Barra said onstage. “There came a point earlier this year where we said: ‘How much harder can we go when we don’t have the legislative change?’ And then if you look at how hard it is to get a new law passed right now, we decided that we had to make the right decision.”
That decision came earlier this year in July, after months of controversy at GM’s self-driving subsidiary Cruise. GM took a $583 million charge when it canceled the Origin project. The company had once projected it would make Origins “in the tens of thousands.”
Barra also said on the Disrupt Stage that she “absolutely” still believes people will one day buy their own personal autonomous vehicles. “We’re going to see how it unfolds and how consumers leverage the technology,” she said.
But she admitted that the rise of autonomous vehicle technology has taken longer than she imagined. “I think we all thought in that 2016, 2017 time frame it was going to go much more quickly,” she said.
This story has been updated to reflect that GM has suspended work on the Origin."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/elevenlabs-has-hired-the-team-behind-omnivore-a-reader-app/,"ElevenLabs has hired the team behind Omnivore, a reader app | TechCrunch",Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-29,"Generative AI company ElevenLabs has hired the team behind Omnivore, an open source read-it-later app.
In a blog post, Omnivore co-founders Jackson Harper and Hongbo Wu said that joining ElevenLabs would give them “an even larger platform to create accessible and engaging experiences for serious readers.”
“ElevenLabs is committed to the developer community and the Omnivore codebase will remain 100% open-source for all users,” Harper and Wu wrote. “This decision ensures that the broader development community can continue to build upon and improve Omnivore’s technology.”
Omnivore users can export their data until November 16, at which point the data will be deleted.
Harper and Wu launched Omnivore in 2021 with the goal of building a read-it-later solution for — as they put it — “people who like text.” Wu and Harper previously worked together at Juvo, a credit scoring firm, where Harper was head of data engineering.
Omnivore is a fully featured platform, with functionality like highlighting, PDF and offline support, apps for the web, iOS, and Android, and extensions for every major web browser. Omnivore also offers text-to-speech, powered by ElevenLabs’ voice generation API.
“We came to know ElevenLabs by integrating their ultra-realistic AI voices into Omnivore,” Harper and Wu wrote. “Soon enough, listening to articles and books with ElevenLabs voices became one of our most popular features in Omnivore.”
With the move to ElevenLabs, Harper and Wu say that they’ll be investing their development efforts in ElevenReader, ElevenLabs’ own reader app. (In fact, they say they’ve already shipped “valuable updates” to ElevenReader.) ElevenReader, which launched earlier this year, lets users upload articles, PDFs, and e-books and listen to them in different languages and voices, including the voices of actors like Judy Garland and James Dean.
One presumes that a few of Omnivore’s capabilities will make their way into ElevenReader in time.
“Our team is joining ElevenLabs to help drive the future of accessible reading and listening with ElevenReader,” Harper and Wu said. “We’re hard at work ensuring an accessible, bright future for readers everywhere.”
ElevenLabs, which became a unicorn earlier this year after raising $80 million from investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, makes most of its money through AI tools to generate synthetic voices for audiobook narrations and video dubbing into other languages. It’s being approached by backers about a new funding round that could value the company at around $3 billion, TechCrunch reported this month."

This years-in-the-making operation saw international law enforcement agencies dismantle the infrastructure of Redline and Meta, two prolific malware strains that have been used to steal sensitive information from millions of people.
A complaint unsealed on Tuesday revealed how a series of operational security — or “opsec” — errors led to the authorities identifying Rudometov. According to the indictment, Rudometov used a Yandex email account known to law enforcement to register accounts on Russian-language hacking forums, where he used a handful of monikers that were reused across other platforms, including Skype and iCloud.
U.S. authorities say they were able to retrieve files from Rudometov’s iCloud account, including “numerous files that were identified by antivirus engines as malware, including at least one that was … determined to be Redline.”
The same Yandex email address was also used by Rudometov to create a publicly viewable profile on the Russian social networking service VK, according to the complaint. Law enforcement found that Rudometov “bore a close resemblance” to an individual depicted in an advertisement found in an earlier blog post about Redline. The advertisement promoted the individual’s skills in “writing botnets and stealers.”
Rudemetov allegedly also used one of his hacking monikers — “ghacking” — on VK’s dating website, according to the complaint.
After receiving a tip from an unnamed security firm in August 2021, U.S. authorities obtained a search warrant to analyze the data found in one of the servers used by Redline, which provided additional information — including IP addresses and a Binance address registered to the same Yandex account — linking Rudometov to the development and deployment of the notorious infostealer.
“Rudometov regularly accessed and managed the infrastructure of Redline infostealer, was associated with various cryptocurrency accounts used to receive and launder payments, and was in possession of Redline malware,” the Department of Justice said on Tuesday. The complaint revealed that Redline had been used to infect millions of computers around the world since February 2020, including “several hundred” machines used by the U.S. Department of Defense.
It’s not yet known if Rudometov has been arrested. If convicted, he faces up to 35 years in prison.
Europol and the Dutch police also revealed further information about Operation Magnus on Tuesday, indicating that three servers were taken offline in the Netherlands and two domains used for command and control operations by Redline and Meta were seized.
Authorities also took down multiple Telegram accounts associated with the malware, which has “caused the sale of the stealers … to be halted,” and two additional individuals — including a customer of the malware — were arrested in Belgium."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/salva-health-wants-to-lower-breast-cancer-mortality-with-its-affordable-screening-device/,Salva Health wants to lower breast cancer mortality with its affordable screening device | TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,2024-10-29,"Six years ago, while researching for a college entrepreneurship competition, Valentina Agudelo identified a troubling gap in breast cancer survival rates between Latin America and the developed world, with women in her native Colombia and the rest of the continent dying at higher rates due to late detection.
She realized that breast cancer is highly treatable when diagnosed early, yet many Latin American countries have large rural populations lacking access to mammograms and other diagnostic tools.
So Agudelo (pictured above) and her two best friends decided to create a theoretical portable device that would detect breast cancer early.
“The idea stuck with me,” Agudelo told TechCrunch. “I just couldn’t let go of the problem we had identified.”
Shortly after the competition ended, Agudelo founded Salva Health and began developing the company’s first product, Julietta, a small device that measures tissue density with electrodes that attach to each breast and provides results within minutes to a phone, tablet, or computer.
Since then, Agudelo graduated from college, interned at PepsiCo, worked for Colombian health tech startup Dondoctor, and completed an MBA at INSEAD. It was a lot to juggle, but Salva always remained her main focus.
Salva Health partnered with Grupo Sura, a major Colombian insurance company, to conduct clinical trials and develop an AI model capable of predicting breast cancer risk.
The company currently employs 13 people and is close to receiving approval from Colombia’s INVIMA (National Institute for Drug and Food Surveillance), a regulatory agency equivalent to the FDA.
Julieta is not a substitute for mammograms. It’s a screening tool designed to detect abnormalities and assess the likelihood of malignancy. “With that information, insurance companies can prioritize women for proper diagnosis,” Agudelo said.
Salva, a TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 Startup Battlefield finalist, plans to start distributing Julieta throughout Latin America after it receives the green light from INVIMA. Agudelo explained that other countries in the region are expected to recognize INVIMA’s approvals based on commercial treaties.
The company also intends to request that the FDA acknowledges INVIMA’s approval. Although the U.S. doesn’t have a significant shortage of mammogram machines or a large rural population, screening some women with Julieta instead could result in substantial cost savings for health insurances, Agudelo said.
“And then, we want to start getting approval and recognized in other countries, focused on emerging markets: Africa, India,” she said.
Instead of selling Julieta to clinics, Salva plans to provide the device for free and charge health payors for each screening.
Agudelo said that she chose the hardware-as-a-service business model because she wanted to retain control of the device and data, so the company can make improvements to it when necessary.
But Salva doesn’t want to limit itself to breast screening only. “We’re currently exploring solutions for early signs of diabetes and cardiovascular disease,” Agudelo said. “We are focusing on detecting these conditions early so they can get proper diagnosis and treatment at a fraction of the cost.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/apple-intelligence-is-more-about-convenience-with-initial-ios-18-1-launch/,Apple Intelligence is more about convenience with initial iOS 18.1 launch | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-29,"After much hype, Apple Intelligence, the company’s suite of AI features, finally shipped to users this week with the iOS 18.1 update. I used these features for months through beta software and realized that the feature set rolling out this week is more about creating convenience for users than letting users plan or brainstorm ideas with ChatGPT or search the web with Perplexity.
One of my favorite features in the rollout is the ability to type and talk to Siri. This allows me to easily set timers or ask for currency conversions without Siri saying, “I didn’t quite understand that.” You can enable this through Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri > Talk & Type to Siri > Type to Siri toggle and then double tap on the bottom bar anytime to invoke Siri.
This is more of a convenience. The new Siri will possibly understand you better when you stutter or change the timer from 10 minutes to 15 minutes. However, for a lot of queries — such as “What can you use as a pine nut substitute?” — Siri will still get knowledge from the web or redirect you to a website.
One of the features I used the most in the last few weeks is Apple’s photo cleanup. This allows people to remove certain objects in photos, such as a passerby photobombing your selfie, through auto selection or manual selection.
The removal is not flawless — if you look closely at the removed part, you will see blemishes. At times, these artifacts are more noticeable. But through some cropping and clever filter use, these photos are useful for posting on social media at least. After I demoed this feature to a few friends, they started routinely sending me photos to clean up. Notably, Google has its own photo-cleanup feature called Magic Eraser, which is available on Pixel phones and Google Photos.
Notification summary is a tricky feature. You can choose to summarize notifications from all, none, or selected apps. The summary is mostly accurate, but at times, it reads weirdly. For example, my friend said in separate messages that she didn’t know why her feet hurt. The end result was this:
Admittedly, the summary feature helped me remove messages from the notification tray that were informational or didn’t need my attention at that point. I am not alone in finding the notification summaries funny sometimes. Plenty of people on social media posted about these summaries, including a person who allegedly said he learned he was being dumped through these summaries.
Apple Intelligence summaries are kinda crazy.A friend sent the image of the car in a group chat and the screenshot on the right shows how the model summarized it in the notifications panel. pic.twitter.com/MJ3a4Ns1Oa
Generally Apple Intelligence’s notification summaries have been pretty useful but this one…  🫢😅🤣 pic.twitter.com/DIkCcdgYgW
My mom: That hike almost killed me!Apple’s AI summary: pic.twitter.com/fyN5UopIdH
I don’t know what the right combination of useful and funny is, but Apple’s Craig Federighi told The Wall Street Journal that, at times, the summary might not be funny for users. Plus, the system won’t automatically summarize notifications for contexts that might be sensitive.
Apple’s Writing Tools feature is something that I haven’t used a lot on the iPhone. That’s partly because I do a ton of writing on a desktop and partly because I didn’t feel the need to have AI make my email more “professional.” I used the proofread function on occasion, and it was good enough for a basic check. Early in my testing, I noticed the tool stumble in handling swear words and other topics like drugs, killing, or murder. It might not be useful if you are writing a thriller plot.
Apple’s first set of features does not generate texts or images for users in a way that tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude do. The second set of AI features available on developer beta might do some of the magic tricks while also integrating with ChatGPT for answers and text generation. For now, Apple Intelligence might make your life a tiny bit better, but it might not be enough to convince you to buy the new iPhone that is “built for Apple Intelligence.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/luna-wants-to-help-young-girls-navigate-their-health-and-well-being/,Luna wants to help young girls navigate their health and well-being   | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-29,"Meet Luna, a health and well-being app for teen girls that is designed to help them navigate teenhood. The app lets teens ask questions about their health and wellness and get responses from experts. It also lets them track their periods, moods, and skin. The London-based startup presented today at on the Startup Battlefield stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 to detail its mission to educate and support teen girls.
Luna is the brainchild of best friend duo Jas Schembri-Stothart and Jo Goodall, who came up with the idea for the startup as part of an assignment during their MBA program at Oxford.
As part of their coursework, Schembri-Stothart and Goodall were required to form a team, find a problem, come up with an idea, and then pitch it to mock investors. They were allowed to choose their own teammates, and Schembri-Stothart told TechCrunch that she wanted to ensure she formed a team of talented women.
After forming a team with a few other women from around the world, the group got to talking about the women’s health issues they were experiencing in their late 20s and early 30s, and the conversation kept coming back to the fact that they had lacked information about their health in their adolescence.
They all agreed that if they learned more about the red flags around women’s health when they were teenagers, they would have been able to navigate teenhood and young adulthood more easily.
The group came up with the idea of an app that would help teenagers with their health and well-being journeys throughout puberty. After pitching the idea to their professors, they received positive feedback. Although the duo remained focused on their studies and set the project aside, they revisited the idea over their summer break and thought about bringing it to life.
Schembri-Stothart and Goodall decided to revisit their old high schools to set up focus groups with teens to learn about their perspectives on their idea. The teens told the duo that they were facing a misinformation crisis and didn’t know what was fact or fake because they were getting most of their information from TikTok.
They also noted that the education system was not helping them learn about their health and bodies.
“We left these sessions and people were emailing us, like ‘Hey, where can we download the app’?” Schembri-Stothart said. “We were like there’s clearly a demand for this and there’s a massive opportunity here that no one’s tapping into, and if we don’t do it, someone else will and we’ll be shooting ourselves in the foot. So, we decided to just go for it.”
After graduating from their MBA program in 2021, the duo built the app and launched a simple version of it in November 2022 that they shared with the teenagers who attended their focus groups. Since then, the company has been building out the app and adding new functionality based on responses from users.
Luna lets users ask anonymous questions and get responses from experts like general practitioners, gynecologists, dermatologists, academics, and more. All of the questions are anonymous, and you can check out and read questions asked by other users on the app.
To date, nearly 45,000 questions have been asked on the platform by 100,000 members. The startup is using AI to quickly field answers for questions that have already been asked on the platform.
For instance, if a user asks how to get better skin and a dermatologist on the app responds, their response will automatically be used to respond to other users who have asked the same question. This way, medical experts don’t have to spend time responding to each question individually and can focus on providing new advice and insights.
The app features a series of questions that it asks users each day to start tracking how they feel, while also logging their periods, skin, sleep, and more. Each month, Luna provides users with a report that gives them insights based on what they logged. The app will nudge users to form healthy habits and consider chatting with their doctor about certain things, such as consistently heavy periods.
Luna also features a “Learn” section where users can get information about specific topics around things like body positivity, work anxiety, relationships, and more through articles and videos from experts.
“I would like Luna to be in the pockets of teens everywhere, enabling a more educated and empowered generation of women, and not only helping teen girls, but helping their parents as well, because I think there’s a massive untapped opportunity for supporting parents. We see a lot with prenatal and newborns, but then it sort of drops off when it comes to high school.”
The app operates on a freemium model where users can access all parts of Luna for free, but then get capped at a certain point of usage. Users can pay €2.99 per month for unlimited access to the app.
The startup has raised €1.4 million in funding to date, and has received investments from several angels and funds, including Syndicate Room, Octopus Ventures, Moonstone, Jade Ventures, and Incisive Ventures.
Luna is available worldwide, except the United States. The company wants to launch in the States next year after ensuring it has the best product possible in order to take advantage of the massive market opportunity.
Luna is available on iOS and Android."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/ctgt-aims-to-make-ai-models-safer/,CTGT aims to make AI models safer | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-29,"Growing up as an immigrant, Cyril Gorlla taught himself how to code — and practiced as if a man possessed.
“I aced my mother’s community college programming course at 11, amidst periodically disconnected household utilities,” he told TechCrunch.
In high school, Gorlla learned about AI, and became so obsessed with the idea of training his own AI models that he took apart his laptop to upgrade the internal cooling. This tinkering led to an internship at Intel during Gorlla’s second year in college, where he researched AI model optimization and interpretability.
Gorlla’s college years coincided with the AI boom — one that’s seen companies like OpenAI raise billions of dollars for their AI tech. Gorlla believed that AI had the potential to transform entire industries. But he also thought that safety work was taking a backseat to shiny new products.
“I felt there needed to be a foundational shift in how we understand and train AI,” he said. “The lack of certainty and trust in models’ output is a significant barrier to adoption in industries like healthcare and finance, where AI can make the biggest difference.”
So, along with Trevor Tuttle, who he met as an undergraduate, Gorlla dropped out of his graduate program to start a company, CTGT, to help orgs more thoughtfully deploy AI. CTGT pitched today at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 as part of the Startup Battlefield competition.
“My parents believe I’m in school,” he said. “Reading this might come as a shock to them.”
CTGT works with companies to identify biased outputs and hallucinations from models, and attempt to address the root cause of these.
It’s impossible to completely eliminate errors from a model. But Gorlla claims that CTGT’s auditing approach can empower firms to mitigate them.
“We expose a model’s internal understanding of concepts,” he explained. “While a model telling a user to put glue into a recipe might be humorous, a response that recommends competitors when a customer asks for a product comparison is not so trivial. A patient being given information from a clinical study that is outdated, or a credit decision made on hallucinated info, is unacceptable.”
A recent poll from Cnvrg found that reliability was a top concern shared by enterprises adopting AI apps. In a separate study from Riskonnect, a risk management software provider, more than half of execs said they were worried about employees making decisions based on inaccurate information from AI tools.
The idea of a dedicated platform to evaluate an AI model’s decision-making isn’t new. TruEra and Patronus AI are among the startups developing tools to interpret model behavior, as are Google and Microsoft.
But Gorlla claims CTGT’s techniques are more performant — in part because they don’t rely on training “judge” AI to monitor in-production models.
“Our mathematically-guaranteed interpretability differs from current state-of-the-art methods, which are inefficient and train hundreds of other models to gain insight on a model,” he said. “As companies grow increasingly aware of compute costs, and enterprise AI transitions from demos to providing real value, our value is significant in providing companies the ability to rigorously test the safety of advanced AI without training additional models or using other models as a judge.”
To assuage potential customers’ fears of data leaks, CTGT offers an on-premises option in addition to a managed plan. It charges the same annual fee for both.
“We do not have access to customers’ data, giving them full control over how and where it is used,” Gorlla said.
CTGT, a graduate of the Character Labs accelerator, has the backing of former GV partners Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky (who co-founded Character VC), Mark Cuban, and Zapier co-founder Mike Knoop.
“AI that can’t explain its reasoning is not intelligent enough for many areas where complex rules and requirements apply,” Cuban said in a statement. “I invested in CTGT because it is solving this problem. More importantly, we are seeing results in our own use of AI.”
And — despite being early-stage — CTGT has several customers, including three unnamed Fortune 10 brands. Gorlla says that CTGT worked with one of these companies to minimize bias in their facial recognition algorithm. “We identified bias in the model focusing too much on hair and clothing to make its predictions,” he said. “Our platform provided the practitioners immediate insights without the guesswork and wasted time of traditional interpretability methods.”
CTGT’s focus in the coming months will be on building out its engineering team (it’s only Gorlla and Tuttle at the moment) and refining its platform.
Should CTGT manage to gain a foothold in the burgeoning market for AI interpretability, it could be lucrative indeed. Analytics firm Markets and Markets projects that “explainable AI” as a sector could be worth $16.2 billion by 2028.
“Model size is far outpacing Moore’s Law and the advances in AI training chips,” Gorlla said. “This means that we need to focus on foundational understanding of AI — to cope with both the inefficiency and increasingly complex nature of model decisions.”"

Finix raised $75 million for its biggest push yet against competitor Stripe. CEO and founder Richie Serna told TechCrunch that becoming a payment processor was “hugely transformational” for the business, and a main driver of the fundraise. Serna says Finix has quadrupled its revenue in the last year, but there’s still a long way to go to compete with Stripe’s customer base.
Upflow is a startup that originally focused on managing outstanding invoices. But the company is now announcing a shift in its strategy to become a B2B payment platform with its own payment gateway to complement its accounts receivable automation solution.
Remote, an HR platform for managing geographically distributed teams, is doubling down on its focus on managing equity compensation with a new product: Remote Equity. Thanks to a new partnership, companies using Carta to manage their cap table can now draft and issue option grants in Carta and include international employees.
SoLo Funds is facing a new class action lawsuit. The suit, first reported by Bloomberg, accuses SoLo Funds of misleading consumers by advertising zero-interest fees on loans yet encouraging “tip fees” and “donation fees” to obtain said loans. The complaint alleges these are hidden fees that are hard to opt out of, making the company’s loans more expensive than borrowers expected."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/hilos-is-making-footwear-more-sustainable-without-skimping-on-style/,HILOS is making footwear more sustainable without skimping on style | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-10-29,"When people imagine what 3D printing is, they might think of plastic knickknacks and miniature figurines that teenagers make in their high school libraries. For HILOS (Human Innovation Lab Operating System), 3D printing means creating footwear that’s chic, low-waste, and runway ready.
“Brands are overproducing 20% because they don’t know what size and styles are going to be needed when, and so they have to overproduce, and they’re still missing sales,” HILOS CEO Elias Stahl told TechCrunch. HILOS pitched today on the Startup Battlefield stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024.
That overproduction leads to waste, which contributes to the 300 million pairs of shoes that Americans throw away every year. When those shoes end up in landfills, they can take 30 to 40 years to decompose.
A surefire way to minimize overproduction is to only produce what customers actually buy — but on-demand retail services are expensive, since the shoes aren’t made in bulk. But with its 3D printing technology, HILOS has found a way to print stylish shoes on demand within 72 hours.
“HILOS has patented new forms of shoemaking specifically for digital manufacturing, so they’re specifically for less labor, less component parts,” Stahl said. “We take what might traditionally be five or six different materials, combine them into one printed material, so that you can literally print and assemble in the U.S., paying American wages without having the shoe be a $300 shoe.”
HILOS doesn’t sell shoes on its own; it borrows concepts from past e-commerce trendsetters like Bonobos. For brands that work with HILOS, their stores can stock less inventory, so that customers can try them on — then, once customers figure out what style and size suits them, they can have the shoe shipped to them.
“So instead of having 20 [shoes] and having to reorder every 120 days, they can have two and reorder every 72 hours,” Stahl said.
To make its 3D-printed shoes, HILOS uses powder-based printing, as opposed to the cheaper, plastic styles that you’d find in schools.
“Powder is the most expensive, most industrial, and the highest quality and finish,” Stahl said. “So when we pull something like this out of the printer, it’s got this soft, suede, velvety feel.”
The shoe itself is not magically appearing out of the 3D printer — the company prints a handful of modular shoe parts, which can be easily and quickly assembled. Nor are they made of the 3D-printed material, which would likely sacrifice functionality and comfort. Instead, HILOS stocks materials like leather and knits, which it also uses in a modular, multi-functional way.
“This is where a modular product creation process really allows for a lot of efficiencies,” Stahl said. “You can have 10 different leather wares that supply 40 different styles.”
Even with this modular manufacturing set-up, designing a shoe still takes a long time. As part of its tech platform for brands, HILOS uses AI and AR technology to more quickly convert sketches of shoes into 3D models that can be printed.
“We can automate and accelerate that process, so a 2D image can immediately become a 3D file that is manufacturable, that is wearable, and it’s end to end,” Stahl said.
If a designer works in more analog methods to model the prototypes of their shoes, the AR tools can mimic the design, taking it from physical to digital.
“The idea is to allow the designer to design in the physical world, and to design not through a screen or a mouse, but to be creative where they are creative, to be inspired where they’re inspired, because technology, after certain levels, should become invisible,” Stahl said.
HILOS intentionally decided to set up shop in Portland, Ore., where over 500 outdoor brands are headquartered, such as Nike, Adidas, and Columbia. The company is one of the leaders of Portland’s Made in Old Town project, which aims to bring green footwear manufacturing back onshore. Oregon lawmakers backed the initiative, approving a $125 million grant to revitalize 10 buildings and four city blocks.
“Rather than having these giant factories on the outskirts of town in Guangdong, China, we can have our actual communities here in the U.S., our downtowns filled with on-demand manufacturing that’s high-craft, high-quality labor, that’s sustainable, and that reinvents how we see our downtown,” Stahl said. “Portland has been an amazing home for us.”
On stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, HILOS announced a new partnership with the shoe brand Steve Madden, who will use HILOS’ on-demand product creation platform to make its supply chain more sustainable."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/amazon-brings-its-rufus-ai-shopping-assistant-to-more-international-markets/,Amazon brings its Rufus AI shopping assistant to more international markets | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-29,"Amazon is extending the availability of its AI-enabled shopping assistant, Rufus, to more markets in Europe and the Americas.
The e-commerce giant has been widely considered to be playing catch-up with its Big Tech brethren in the AI sphere, particularly against the backdrop of the generative AI hype these past couple of years. Rufus is one of the ways Amazon is showing that it’s up for the game. Key features the tool offers include product search support, product comparisons, and recommendations on what to buy.
The AI chatbot has been trained on Amazon’s arsenal of data, spanning customer reviews, product catalogs, and other tangential public data to be primed to answer shoppers’ natural language questions, such as: “Can you recommend some great gifts for kids under 5?” or “Compare different kinds of coffee makers.”
To access Rufus, shoppers in the new markets must update their Amazon Shopping app to the latest version; then they can tap a little icon at the bottom right that surfaces a familiar chatbot-style interface.
The e-commerce giant first trialed Rufus in the U.S. back in February, before formally launching it five months later. In the intervening months, a beta version of the AI assistant has landed in India and the U.K. On Tuesday, Amazon further expanded the beta’s availability to Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.
Rufus isn’t the only generative AI tool that Amazon has been working on — the company also recently launched new tools to help sellers improve their listings by generating product descriptions, titles, and associated details. Amazon has also committed $230 million to supporting generative AI startups.
Amazon is quick to stress that this is still an early iteration of Rufus, and — like many generative AI applications — it “won’t always get it exactly right.”
“We will keep improving our AI models and fine-tuning responses to continuously make Rufus more helpful over time,” the company wrote in a blog post."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/linkedin-launches-its-first-ai-agent-to-take-on-the-role-of-job-recruiters/,LinkedIn launches its first AI agent to take on the role of job recruiters | TechCrunch,Ingrid Lunden,2024-10-29,"LinkedIn, the social platform used by professionals to connect with others in their field, hunt for jobs, and develop skills, is taking the wraps off its latest effort to build artificial intelligence tools for users. Hiring Assistant is a new product designed to take on a wide array of recruitment tasks, from ingesting scrappy notes and thoughts to turn into longer job descriptions to sourcing candidates and engaging with them.
LinkedIn is describing Hiring Assistant as a milestone in its AI trajectory: It is, per the Microsoft-owned company, its first “AI agent” and one that happens to be targeting one of LinkedIn’s most lucrative categories of users — recruiters.
LinkedIn said the AI assistant is now live with a “select group” of customers (large enterprises such as AMD, Canva, Siemens and Zurich Insurance among them). It’s slated to be rolling out more widely in the coming months.
The platform was always an early adopter of AI in its back end — (somewhat creepily) folding AI techniques into its algorithms to produce surprisingly accurate connection recommendations to users, for example.
The viral rise of generative AI a couple of years ago, however, left LinkedIn — like pretty much every other tech company — scrambling to bring its front end up to speed.
LinkedIn didn’t have to look too far to start to fix that. Microsoft has a deep financial and operational partnership with generative AI giant OpenAI, and LinkedIn has been leaning hard into that relationship to roll out a number of tools lately, including learning coaches, marketing campaign assistants, and candidate sorters; writing and job hunting helpers; and profile refreshers — all powered by APIs from OpenAI’s GPT large language model.
Hiring Assistant is the latest, and in some ways a more pivotal chapter, in that story — and so it’s an interesting one for a couple of reasons.
First, it’s notable for how much it takes the work out of human hands. The company has, in fact, launched AI tools for recruiters before. A year ago, it unveiled its first GenAI helpers for sorting candidates as part of “Recruiter 2024” (actually revealed, like a new car model, in 2023).
If that was testing the waters, LinkedIn’s now asking recruiters to just jump in.
“It’s designed to take on a recruiter’s most repetitive task so they can spend more time on the most impactful part of their jobs,” Hari Srinivasan, LinkedIn’s VP of product, said in an interview — “a big statement,” he admitted.
The product includes the ability to upload full job descriptions, or just note what you want it to have, along with job postings that you like the look of from other companies or roles.
In turn, that becomes a list of qualifications you’re looking for, as well as an initial pipeline of candidates that you can interact with — to look for more potential hires that are similar to some or less like others — with algorithms designed to search based on skills rather than other indicators (such as where a person lives or went to school), per Srinivasan.
The AI assistant also integrates with third-party application tracking systems, although ultimately, the whole system is trained on LinkedIn data, which spans 1 billion users, 68 million companies, and 41,000 skills.
LinkedIn said Hiring Assistant is due to get more features soon, such as messaging and scheduling support for interviews, as well as handling follow-ups when candidates have questions before or after interviews. Basically the aim is for it to cover a lot of (time-consuming) admin-style busywork tasks, plus take on some of the thinking, that recruiters have to do daily.
Second, unlike many of the other AI features that LinkedIn has released, Hiring Assistant is very squarely aimed at LinkedIn’s B2B business, the products it sells to the recruitment industry.
The company hasn’t provided an update on how Talent Solutions (which includes its Recruiter business) has been performing since July 2023, when it said it had passed revenues of $7 billion for the first time. But LinkedIn has demonstrated already that AI — for now at least — remains an important business driver for the company. Specifically, Premium subscriptions, taken by ordinary consumers, are already being driven by a growth in AI tool usage (with some tools available only to Premium users).
Whether that will carry into how recruiters pay for services on the platform, and whether they see these tools as a help or a threat, remains to be seen. Either way, LinkedIn is unlikely to slow this train down.
“We’re really focused on making Hiring Assistant great,” said Erran Berger, VP of engineering, in an interview. “This is all bleeding edge, and I mean everything from the experience and how our users are going to interact with it, to the technology that backs it. And so we’re really focused on nailing that a lot of the technology we’ve built is applicable to problems that we’re trying to solve for our members and customers. But right now, you know, we really just want to nail this, and then we can figure out where we go from there.”"

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/github-spark-lets-you-build-web-apps-in-plain-english/,GitHub Spark lets you build web apps in plain English | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-10-29,"When GitHub Copilot launched and started autocompleting lines of code — and, later, entire code snippets — the question many people were asking was: How long until we can just describe an app in natural language and Copilot will build it for us? We’ve seen quite a few experiments in this arena in recent months, but now, GitHub itself is throwing its weight behind this idea with the announcement of GitHub Spark at the company’s annual GitHub Universe conference in San Francisco.
Spark, which is officially an experiment the company is launching out of its GitHub Next labs, allows you to quickly build a small web app using nothing but natural language. Experienced developers can still see and edit the code — and underneath it all is a GitHub repository, GitHub Actions, and Microsoft’s Azure CosmosDB as the default database for applications that need one — but that’s optional. Ideally, you’ll be able to use a chat-like experience to create a prototype and then refine it in subsequent steps.
To build an app, you start with an initial prompt and Spark will show you a live preview within a few seconds. From there, you can fine-tune the app and iterate by going back and forth with the bot.
“We truly believe this is the next step of personal software creation,” GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke told me. “These micro apps, they’re not intended to replace the professional developer. They’re intended to be a tool for you to explore ideas, for you to build little bots, little helpers in your day-to-day — or to just explore software development with natural language.”
While GitHub’s materials talk about Spark as a tool for buildin”g “micro apps,” Dohmke told me that he wasn’t actually sure if there were built-in limitations to how complex a Spark application could get, and a GitHub spokesperson confirmed that there are indeed no limits on prompts or capacity right now (though that may change after the technical preview). Dohmke noted that Spark can use any web API and leverage AI models itself and that he is excited to see how far GitHub’s users will push this tool.
“It will be very exciting to see, honestly, what users can do, how big of an application they can build with just the power of natural language and this simple user interface that really is designed for you to explore ideas, to spark new ideas,” he said.
Because GitHub Copilot now allows users to choose which large language model they want to use, it’s no surprise that Spark offers the same capability, with users getting the choice between the recent versions of Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet and OpenAI’s GPT models.
Users can easily share their Sparks with customized access controls. What’s maybe even more interesting, though, is that those users can also take the shared code and build upon it themselves.
Developers who want to take these applications even further can look at the code at any time — and edit it if there’s an issue, which Dohmke acknowledges could happen. AI isn’t perfect, after all. “You can, of course, look into the code base,” he said. “So if you have an understanding of the code base, you can also look at the code directly and modify that, which is often helpful when the AI makes a mistake — which does happen.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/githubs-copilot-goes-multi-model-and-adds-support-for-anthropics-claude-and-googles-gemini/,GitHub's Copilot goes multi-model and adds support for Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-10-29,"GitHub today announced that it will now allow developers to switch between a number of large language models when they use Copilot Chat, its code-centric ChatGPT-like service.  Until now, Copilot Chat was powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4. Going forward, developers can choose between Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, and OpenAI’s GPT-4o, o1-preview, and o1-mini. Anthropic will launch first, with Gemini following in a few weeks.
Some pundits may see this as yet another way for Microsoft to reduce its reliance on OpenAI, but GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke framed it in terms of giving developers a choice. Not every model, after all, excels at every development-related task, and some models are simply better at working with certain languages than others.
“We truly believe that the era of a single model is over,” Dohmke told me. “As you know, GitHub Copilot itself has always used multiple versions of the GPT-3 or -4 models for different tasks. Where low latency was required, we were using a faster, smaller model. Where we needed higher accuracy, we were using a bigger, more complex model. We, at GitHub, believe in developer choice and that developers — for reasons of company policy, benchmarks that they have seen, different programming languages and, of course, personal preference, or because they’re using that model for other scenarios already — prefer one of the competing models, and so we’re officially partnering with both Anthropic and Google.”
The team had already done some of the prep work for this launch when it started offering developers the choice between GPT-4 and GPT-4 o1, which launched just over a month ago.
For now, this choice applies only to Copilot Chat and the newly launched Spark, but Dohmke noted that the company wants to bring this choice to all of its tools.
“Developers want a broad choice of models that are best-suited for development, including code generation, refactoring, and optimizing code,” said Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian. “Gemini models excel at this and are accessible on widely used developer platforms and environments — including now with GitHub Copilot — so millions of developers globally can benefit from trusted, enterprise-grade AI through Google Cloud.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/githubs-copilot-comes-to-apples-xcode/,GitHub's Copilot comes to Apple's Xcode | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-10-29,"At its Universe conference, GitHub today announced a number of major new products, including the Spark project for writing applications entirely with AI, as well as multi-model support for its Copilot service. But Copilot itself is also getting quite a few updates.
With this release, Microsoft-owned GitHub is bringing Copilot to Apple’s Xcode environment for the first time. Now in public preview, this will allow developers who build apps in Apple’s IDE with the assistance of Copilot. For now, the focus here is on code completion, but Copilot Chat and its other features will likely make their way into Xcode over time.
Copilot already supports Apple’s preferred languages Swift and Objective-C, so there’s no surprise there. Copilot, like on other platforms, will offer multi-line suggestions when it can and users will be able to block suggestions that match public code.
“This is a major milestone in our ongoing mission to make Copilot an essential tool for developers across a wide variety of platforms,” GitHub wrote in today’s announcement. “Now, Apple developers can enjoy the same intelligent coding assistance, seamlessly integrated into their favorite IDE.”
All paying Copilot users on individual, business, and enterprise plans will have access to this public beta now. All they have to do to get started is install the Copilot extension for Xcode.
It’s worth noting that while Copilot itself never natively supported Xcode, we’ve seen a few projects like the CopilotForXcode extension that took matters into their own hands and used GitHub’s APIs to bring Copilot code completion to Xcode.
Among the new capabilities are Copilot Chat in VS Code making edits to multiple files at the same time to solve more complex issues, a new code review feature that offers developers feedback on their code, and the ability to give Copilot Chat custom instructions about a user’s (or organization’s) preferred tools, organizational knowledge, and more.
Copilot Extensions, which integrate developer tools and services from companies like Atlassian, Docker, Sentry, and Stack Overflow into Copilot, remain in preview but will become generally available in early 2025. At that time, users will also be able to build their own private extensions that can work with their organization’s DIY tools."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/apples-new-mac-mini-really-lives-up-to-its-name/,Apple’s new M4 Mac Mini really lives up to its name | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-29,"The week of Macs keeps rolling along with a brand-new Mac Mini. The rumors were true: The M4 edition finds the company scaling the little desktop down to not much larger than an Apple TV. The Mini enclosure measures 5 x 5 inches, versus the Apple TV 4K’s 3.66 x 3.66.
The significantly smaller size was made possible by the efficiency of Apple’s in-house silicon. In spite of the smaller size, there’s still a fan onboard, with the thermal vents on the bottom. Presumably this is because the Mini comes with either the base M4 or the newly announced M4 Pro, the latter of which may need to be cooled, depending how hard you push it.
Apple’s opted to compare performance to the original M1 model (versus 2023’s M2 Pro), noting that the standard M4 represents a 1.8x CPU bump and 2.2x on the GPU side.
The M4 Pro makes its debut on the new Mini — with a sizable price bump. Apple is touting the new chip as the “world’s fastest” — take that for what you will. The new GPU array, meanwhile, improves ray tracing by 2x, showcasing Apple’s deepening interest in bring gaming to the Mac.
The M4 Pro is also the first Apple Silicon chip to support Thunderbolt 5 (the M4 model is still rocking Thunderbolt 4). Apple has also moved a pair of ports to the front of the desktop, bringing it more in line with the Mac Studio. Around back, you’ll find three more Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, HDMI, and Ethernet.
Also worth a mention is the fact that the new Mini is Apple’s first carbon-neutral Mac, another step toward the company’s plans to be fully carbon neutral by 2030.
The M4 Mini ships with 16GB of memory and starts at $599. The upgrade to M4 Pro is a big one: That model starts at $1,399. That is, notably, $100 more than the new M4 iMacs introduced on Monday.
Preorders for the Mini open Tuesday, with the device set to start shipping on November 8."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/apple-introduces-its-m4-pro-chip-debuting-on-the-new-mac-mini/,"Apple introduces M4 Pro chip, debuting on the new Mac Mini | TechCrunch",Brian Heater,2024-10-29,"The week of Mac announcements chugs along, as Apple introduces the latest addition to its line of first-party silicon. The new M4 is debuting as an upgradeable option for the just-announced palm-size Mac Mini.
The Pro follows the May release of the original M4. That chip bucked the standard Apple Silicon cycle by debuting on the new iPad Pro prior to its addition to the Mac line.
The new chip is the first bit of Apple Silicon to support Thunderbolt 5, which more than doubles data transfer speed over its predecessor, from 120 GB/s to 273 GB/s. This mean that the M4 Pro has five Thunderbolt 5 ports, whereas the M4 model is still Thunderbolt 4.
The M4 Pro is built around second-gen 3-nanometer tech. It sports up to 14-core CPU, including 10 performance cores and four efficiency cores. The GPU tops out at 20 cores and the Neural Engine at 16. The base M4, meanwhile, goes up to a 10-core CPU, with four performance and six efficiency, up to a 10-core GPU and 16-core Neural Engine
Apple claims the CPU tops single-threaded performance tests. The GPU, meanwhile, doubles the speed of the system’s ray-tracing engine. That’s the latest in Apple’s efforts to turn the Mac into a formidable gaming machine.
Apple claims the improved Neural Engine is up to twice as fast as the previous generation. That’s going to become increasingly central to the Mac experience, as the first wave of Apple Intelligence features hit general availability on Monday.
Notably, the M4 Pro is available at a sizable premium. The new Mac Mini M4 starts at $599. Upgrading the desktop to Pro puts that at $1,399. Those are both up for preorder Tuesday and will ship November 8."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/eu-boosts-eic-budget-for-supporting-deeptech-rd-and-strategic-scale-ups/,EU boosts EIC budget for supporting deep tech R&D and strategic scale-ups | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-29,"The European Union will spend €1.4 billion (about $1.5 billion) next year to bolster deep tech research and support scale-ups in strategic areas like AI, low-carbon technologies, agritech and biotech, the European Commission said on Tuesday.
The budget for the 2025 Work Program of the European Innovation Council (EIC), part of the bloc’s flagship Horizon Europe research program, has been increased by nearly €200 million compared to last year.
The Commission highlighted several other “improvements” on the 2024 program, including better access to scale-up equity funding via the EIC Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) scheme.
The revisions to the EIC work program for 2025 follow the bloc adopting the STEP regulation in February with the aim of strengthening investment in technologies critical to driving digitalization, boosting regional autonomy and supporting the bloc’s Net Zero transition.
The new EIC STEP Scale-Up scheme will have a budget of €300 million in 2025 (the Commission expects it to grow to €900 million by 2027). The funding will be deployed to secure larger investments in companies that bring strategic technologies to the EU and help avoid dependencies by unlocking private sector co-investment.
Under the scheme, the EU fund will provide investments of between €10 million and €30 million per company to draw out private co-investment — achieving at least €50 million to €150 million in total per investment, the Commission said.
“The EIC STEP Scale-up call will help address a market gap in deep tech scale-up funding in Europe, targeting digital technologies, clean and resource-efficient technologies including net-zero, and biotechnologies,” it wrote in a press release.
Elsewhere, the Work program also includes an updated set of EIC Challenges, which aim to encourage innovation in priority areas. About €120 million is pegged for “emerging technologies” like autonomous robots, as well as for climate resilient crops, converting waste to input materials, and medical diagnosis.
There is also €250 million ringfenced for earlier-stage companies in specific target technologies — including generative AI, new space, agritech, and future mobility solutions.
Elsewhere, the Commission said the 2025 Work program will increase access to Business Acceleration Services for emerging companies from countries with lower levels of research and innovation performance. It will also support projects that miss out on EIC funding find alternative sources by awarding them Seals of Excellence.
The EIC Work Program 2025 is built around three main funding schemes, per the Commission.
The first is a research-focused track called EIC Pathfinder, which has a budget of €262 million for “multi-disciplinary research teams to undertake visionary early-stage technology research and development with the potential to lead to technology breakthroughs.” This track will award grants of up to €4 million to successful applicants.
The second is a commercialization-focused track called EIC Transition, which has a budget of €98 million with the goal of turning research results into “innovation opportunities.” These grants can go up to €2.5 million.
Thirdly, there’s a startup and SME track — called EIC Accelerator — which has the largest budget: €634 million. It will be deployed to support startups and SMEs to “develop, commercialise and scale up innovations with the potential to create new markets or disrupt existing ones.” These grants will be below €2.5 million, and investments will stretch from €500,000 to €10 million.
The EIC STEP Scale-Up scheme sits atop these tracks to provide additional funding to promising companies in areas the EU sees as critical.
“Direct financial support to innovators is complemented with access to a wide range of business acceleration services and support actions offering leading expertise and linking with corporates, investors and ecosystem actors,” the Commission added."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/why-crosscut-ventures-is-following-the-founders-into-climate-space-and-beyond/,"Why Crosscut Ventures is 'following the founders' into climate, space, and beyond | TechCrunch",Tim De Chant,2024-10-29,"Eight years ago, Brian Garrett and his partners sensed the ground shifting.
At the time, Crosscut Ventures, where Garrett is co-founder and managing partner, had been investing in early-stage startups in Los Angeles and Southern California for nearly a decade. It focused mostly on software companies, but it started shifting its attention to hardware, too, as promising founders gravitated toward it.
“At that point, SpaceX was very established,” he told TechCrunch. “Mostly, people started to spin out of SpaceX because they had rung the bell and sent stuff up [into space] and back.”
But the founders who came from SpaceX weren’t quite the same as those who helped kickstart LA’s startup scene nearly 20 years ago.
“Those entrepreneurs — you know, I sort of joke, but it’s true — when they think about starting a company, they don’t come with small ideas,” Garrett said. “They just sent a rocket up and back and landed it on a dime. They’re not thinking about a D2C e-commerce apparel brand as their next startup. They’re thinking about big, hairy problems that humanity is facing, and those seem to really be centering around climate problems.”
The focus of the new $100 million fund, Crosscut’s sixth, will include energy and power, space and underwater exploration, advanced manufacturing, advanced materials, and security and defense. That’s a broad range, but Garrett said the uniting theme is “frontier tech.”
Climate is a through line in several of those verticals. One technology, advanced nuclear, which the firm has a “pretty significant thesis around,” Garrett said, arguably fits in each of them. The same is true of transmission and grid technologies, another Crosscut interest.
Given the focus on hardware-centric technologies, Garrett said the fund is realistic about how long those investments can take to mature. “They can’t all be big hardware swings that are going to take a billion dollars to build. We have to build portfolios smartly and blend them with some software.”
Despite the costs, hardware remains alluring to investors for several reasons: The opportunity to have an impact can be bigger when hardware is involved, especially in something like climate where the problem is driven by the burning of fossil fuels, something no amount of software can completely eliminate.
But hardware startups face challenges that their software cousins do not, particularly accessing capital to prove the commercial viability of the core technology. The problem is most acute in the middle stages of the venture capital stack, typically around Series B or C. It’s called the “valley of death,” the “missing middle,” or the “first-of-a-kind problem,” and founders and investors have started exploring creative ways to bridge the gap.
Seed-stage funds like Crosscut aren’t usually built for that, which is why it will be bringing on a new partner later this year who has expertise in growth and project finance. “We’re trying to build the full stack, the full platform,” Garrett said. “It’s going to take some time, but the idea is to come up with creative financing solutions.”
Growth and project finance dollars should help Crosscut support its most promising hardware startups without taking shortcuts to squeeze them into the usual 10-year venture fund lifecycle. “It gives LPs a product of their choosing that fits their risk-reward profile and time frame.”
Though Crosscut has been drifting toward climate for a while now, Garrett said the focus of the new seed fund is more than just a product of the partners’ interests. “It’s really about understanding what type of problems are being approached by the best entrepreneurs,” he said.
Garrett said that Crosscut has been seeing a number of talented founders emerging from the likes of SpaceX, Anduril, Northrop, and Boeing, all of which have a significant presence in Southern California. Given that, along with the number of investment opportunities they’re seeing across frontier tech, “it just made sense to realign the firm.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/popular-calendar-app-fantastical-lands-on-windows/,Popular calendar app Fantastical lands on Windows | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-10-29,"Buzzy calendar apps tend to make a big splash and disappear after a while. Sometimes they get acquired, sometimes the company pivots to something else. That’s not the case with Fantastical, a popular calendar app for macOS, iOS, and other Apple platforms. Originally launched as a Mac app in 2011, the team behind Fantastical has made the app better, update after update.
Over the past 13 years, Flexibits, the company behind Fantastical, also launched its calendar app on other Apple platforms. You can check your next calendar events on your Apple Watch. You can also plan the next quarter in Fantastical on the Apple Vision Pro if you need spatial computing to focus on your calendar.
On Tuesday, the company is releasing Fantastical on Windows. And if you’re already using Fantastical on a Mac, you’ll feel right at home: It’s basically the same app.
“We’ve been working on it for the last three years. It is everything. It is the last 13 years of Flexibits,” co-founder Michael Simmons told TechCrunch. “In other words, as we’ve added new things to the Mac and iPhone in the last three years as we’ve developed this, we’ve also brought it to Windows.”
Fantastical lets you add all your existing calendar accounts to a single app; it supports Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and iCloud accounts for instance. After that, you can see all your personal and work events in the same calendar interface.
“We all use Apple products, and we love Apple products. But for the mission that we’re really trying to achieve, which is better productivity for everyone, fast and friendly apps for all, I think being on Apple ignores a large amount of users that are at work on Windows PCs,” Simmons said. “And we know that the market for Windows PCs is a huge market.”
“And to be real, I always was like, ‘I’m not making a Windows app.’ I don’t use Windows. Why would I make a Windows app? But throughout the years, I realized it’s not about me using Windows, it’s about customers who can’t access Fantastical using Windows. And then I thought of Fantastical not as an Apple product, but as a product we make,” he said.
In Fantastical, you can also create calendar sets to show and hide specific calendars depending on what you’re looking for. Fantastical offers several well-designed views, including the “DayTicker” view, which lets you see an infinite river of events with a small scrolling calendar at the top.
A popular feature among Fantastical users is that you can use natural language to create an event. For instance, you can type “Lunch with Tim Cook on Tuesday at Caffè Macs on Apple’s campus.” The app will parse that request and create a one-hour event around lunchtime on Tuesday with “Caffè Macs on Apple’s campus” as the event location and Tim Cook in the invitee list.
For advanced calendar users, Fantastical also has a Calendly-like feature called Openings. You can also use Fantastical to create an event link with an RSVP feature for your next birthday party.
And if you have a lot of conference calls, Fantastical automatically detects conference call links in calendar invites and creates a join button in the event list so that you can join in one click.
All of these features are available in the Windows app. Going forward, apps on all platforms will be updated at the same time so that the company can retain feature parity across all platforms.
As some people use a Mac at home and a Windows computer at work, they’ll be able to use the same app on both computers now. Some Fantastical users also started with the iOS app. But they have a Windows laptop. Now, they can also use Fantastical on their PC.
Fantastical is free to download and use but you have to pay a premium subscription to unlock all features for Fantastical and contact management app Cardhop, another app from Flexibits. The premium subscription unlocks access to premium features across all platforms, including Windows. The price isn’t changing with Tuesday’s release; Flexibits Premium currently costs $4.75 per month when billed annually.
Does it mean that Flexibits is going to release an Android version next? Probably not. “I don’t think we would do Android. I feel that market doesn’t get what we’re doing,” Simmons said.
In the last couple of months, several indie app makers have complained about Google’s relationship with indie developers. For instance, iA Writer, a Markdown document editor, is no longer available on Android as Google now requires an expensive security audit from KPMG. Transmit, a file transfer app for macOS, no longer supports Google Drive for more or less the same reason."

The rules, which were first proposed in June by the U.S. Treasury and directed by an executive order President Biden signed in August 2023, cover certain AI systems, quantum information systems, and semiconductors and microelectronics. Specifically, the rules pertain to technologies core to military and surveillance systems, like code-breaking computer systems and next-generation fighter jets.
Beginning January 2, investors will be banned from funneling capital and “intangible benefits,” like managerial assistance and access to investment and talent networks, to help China and other “countries of concern” develop military, intelligence, and cybersecurity capabilities.
Overseen by Treasury’s newly created Office of Global Transactions, the new rules contain a carve-out allowing U.S. investment in publicly traded securities. But previous executive orders bar the buying and selling of securities of certain “designated” Chinese companies."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/moneygram-replaces-ceo-weeks-after-massive-customer-data-breach/,MoneyGram replaces CEO weeks after massive customer data breach | TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,2024-10-29,"Money transfer giant MoneyGram has replaced its chief executive less than a month after confirming that hackers stole reams of customers’ personal information and transaction records in a data breach.
In a statement Monday, MoneyGram said it appointed Anthony Soohoo as the company’s chief executive with immediate effect. Soohoo replaces Alex Holmes, who joined MoneyGram in 2009 and served as its chief financial officer, then chief operating officer, before being appointed CEO and chairman in 2016.
Holmes will remain on as an advisor to the company’s board of directors, the company’s statement said.
When reached by TechCrunch, MoneyGram spokesperson Sydney Schoolfield said: “This announcement is not related to the recent cyber issue. The leadership transition is the result of a several-months long process led by the MoneyGram Board of Directors.”
Holmes’ removal comes in the same month that the company confirmed it had lost an unspecified amount of personal customer information during its September cyberattack. The company has yet to describe the nature of the cyberattack, which sparked in a week-long outage of its money transfer service. The U.K.’s data protection authority confirmed it had received a data breach report from MoneyGram following the cyberattack.
MoneyGram previously said the stolen data includes names, phone numbers, postal and email addresses, dates of birth, and national identification numbers. MoneyGram said the data breach also included a “limited number” of Social Security numbers and government identification documents, including driver’s licenses, utility bills, and bank account numbers.
MoneyGram also said the stolen data includes information about customer transactions, such as dates and amounts of money transfers, and information about criminal investigations related to some customer accounts.
MoneyGram says it serves more than 50 million people in over 200 countries and territories each year. Holmes made $6.7 million in executive compensation during 2021, per a company filing with regulators. When asked, MoneyGram did not provide a more recent figure for Holmes’ executive compensation."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/gmi-cloud-secures-82m-in-series-a-for-its-gpu-cloud-infrastructure/,GMI Cloud secures $82M in Series A for its GPU cloud infrastructure | TechCrunch,Kate Park,2024-10-29,"The AI boom has spurred massive demand for graphics processing units (GPUs). As many enterprises seek to integrate AI technology into their systems, providers of GPU infrastructure are helping businesses get access to the chips they need.
In the latest development, GMI Cloud, a San Jose-based startup that provides GPU cloud infrastructure, has raised an $82 million Series A led by Headline Asia with participation from strategic investors such as Banpu, a Thailand energy firm, and Wistron, a Taiwan-based electronics company. Banpu will offer power to GMI Cloud, while Wistron will co-develop products with the startup. The company’s strategic partnerships boost its capacity to satisfy the increasing worldwide need for GPU resources, founder and CEO of GMI Cloud Alex Yeh told TechCrunch. The investment round, bringing its total raised capital to $93 million, consists of $15 million in equity and $67 million in debt financing.
The outfit, launched in 2022, started as a data center that focused on providing Bitcoin computing node services. Yeh said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch that he noticed growing demand for GPU computing power from investors and clients, and shifted the company’s focus to AI cloud infrastructure in response.
The 2-year-old startup already serves dozens of clients, including those in the healthcare, research, and telecom industries, Yeh said. The corporation plans to utilize the newly acquired funds to establish a new data center in Colorado. This facility will be essential for expanding its capacity in North America and complementing its existing data centers in Taiwan, Thailand, and Malaysia. It also aims to increase its workforce to 60 to 70 staff by the end of the year. The startup has 35 staff in Asia and 18 in the U.S.
A recent McKinsey report predicted that artificial intelligence could contribute around $13 trillion to the economy by 2030, with the industrial sector expected to account for about $1 trillion of that total. The market size of global AI is expected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030, per a report by Grand View Research.
GMI Cloud isn’t the only GPU cloud provider. It competes with CoreWeave, Nebius, Google Cloud’s Vertex AI and Big Tech firms. Yeh told TechCrunch that GMI Cloud distinguishes itself from competitors by providing distinctive features such as customized private cloud services and built-in support for Nvidia NIM, which simplifies integration with Nvidia hardware and software. He also noted that the company has a group of top-tier AI engineers and high-performance computing (HPC) experts with experience at Google X, Alibaba Cloud, and Supermicro.
“[Our] team has over 20 years of AI and HPC experience,” Yeh said, boasting 33 AI patents and extensive experience building large-scale distributed systems. “GMI also offers professional AI consulting services, guiding enterprises on model training, fine-tuning, and scaling, which competitors rarely offer.”
GMI provides a cost-effective solution that delivers optimized performance and resource management compared to competitors, supporting businesses through end-to-end solutions from GPU hardware to AI applications, Yeh highlighted.
“[On top of that], we hold a significant supply chain advantage by sourcing directly from manufacturers, which allows us to maintain cost efficiency and a highly secure supply chain,” Yeh continued. “Uniquely, GMI is also the only Nvidia-certified cloud service provider in Taiwan under the NCP/NPN program, further solidifying its competitive edge in offering premium cloud services.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/tabnine-launches-its-code-review-agent/,Tabnine launches its code review agent | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-10-29,"AI code assistant company Tabnine is launching a code review agent today that aims to help developers stick to their organization’s best practices and standards. It allows organizations to codify these rules either by providing the agent with documentation or by pointing it at a set of “golden code repos.”
The agent will passively review the code as the developer works in the IDE, flag issues as it spots them, and offer fixes when able.
As Tabnine President and CMO Peter Guagenti told me, many companies — and the developers they employ — aren’t even aware of the rules and best practices in their own documentation.
While one of Tabnine’s core tenets has always been to customize the agents based on an organization’s needs, the company also partnered with companies like Redis to collect some of their best practices and pretrained its models on that. Starting today, Tabnine is opening this up to other vendors who want to provide their rules, too.
“Database companies are a great example of this,” he said. “Each one has its own pattern. Each one has its own ways of working that have good and bad outcomes — and when it has a bad outcome, they blame the product, not the code, right? So we think this is a great opportunity for AI to correct the behavior and actually make the products more successful.”
Developers can turn these pretrained rules on and off as needed.
As for how correct the suggestions are, Tabnine argues that its review agents read the code like a human would. That also means that if the code is really obscure, it might miss an issue. But unlike human reviewers, it will read every line of code and not just skim.
It’s surely no coincidence that Tabnine is making today’s announcement on the first day of GitHub’s Universe conference. GitHub’s Copilot, after all, surely has the majority of the brand awareness among AI coding tools. But Guagenti doesn’t seem to worry too much about competing with GitHub.
“We think the business will stratify,” he said. “We think folks like Cursor and others, they’ll eat up the bottom of the market because a lot of people don’t want to write code. We think Copilot has to go for the fat middle — it has to be 80% for as many people as possible. However, that wasn’t [Tabine co-founders] Dror [Weiss’] and Eran [Yahav’s] vision. Their vision was: How do I make the top 1,000 engineering teams in the world more productive, more successful, and write better applications? That vision is now starting to really come together.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/brightwaves-ai-agent-helps-asset-managers-find-signal-and-its-fundraising-fast/,"Brightwave's AI agent helps asset managers find signal, and it's fundraising fast | TechCrunch",Maxwell Zeff,2024-10-29,"The finance world is constantly looking for signal: indicators of buying or selling opportunities in the markets. Some seek out signal in pricey analyst reports, while others might find it in backdoor conversations with insiders. But sometimes, investors just need help seeing such indicators hiding in plain sight.
That’s what Brightwave promises its AI agent can find: signal in public data.
“There’s a hell of a lot of signal in the world that is not currently being transacted upon,” Brightwave CEO Mike Conover (pictured above; right) told TechCrunch. “The core job of an asset manager is to know something about the world that nobody has seen in order to identify a mispriced asset, and it’s not clear that is a task well-suited to the human attention span.”
Conover argues the task may be better suited for his company’s AI system.
Brightwave’s AI agent can generate research reports for asset managers, using generative AI to summarize news events, stories, or market reports. In an example on Brightwave’s website, the AI agent summarizes into roughly five pages a 30-page report on the state of AI from Goldman Sachs, highlighting key numbers and forecasts.
The startup says customers can highlight snippets of text in its AI-generated reports to see the source for any sentence, or dig deeper into specific topics. Brightwave wouldn’t offer TechCrunch a demo of this feature, but it doesn’t sound too dissimilar to the follow-up questions feature offered by Perplexity, which recently introduced its own financial research tool.
There’s no shortage of startups working on AI agents to help with financial research, but Conover says one of Brightwave’s biggest differentiators is its knowledge graph: a structured way of representing real-world entities and their relationships — a simple knowledge graph, for example, could label Elon Musk as the CEO of Tesla in a way automated systems could understand.
Conover worked on knowledge graphs during his PhD, while at LinkedIn, and he holds several patents in the field. He thinks more complex knowledge graphs could unlock better performance for today’s AI systems.
Brightwave this summer raised an oversubscribed $6 million seed round led by Decibel Partners, joining many other AI startups who secured seed funding this year. But unlike its peers, Brightwave has already closed another round just four months later: On Tuesday, the startup said it raised a $15 million Series A, once again led by Decibel, with participation from OMERS Ventures.
Two rounds in four months is pretty quick even for an AI startup today. So, what gives?
Sometimes quick fundraises can help when an AI startup burns through its funding on model training or hiring talent. However, the investor who led both rounds in Brightwave, Decibel partner Alessio Fanelli, says this was not the case. Instead, he says the startup has seen great traction, quadrupling its revenue in four months, and Decibel wanted to close the round quickly to make sure a larger fund didn’t swoop in and box them out of the Series A.
“We don’t really want you to go out there spending too much time talking with other investors and distracting yourself from building the business,” Fanelli told TechCrunch. “Maybe some other VC will tell you to just wait and raise at a higher price later on […] We just want to give you this round today.”
This sentiment may represent a broader pattern of thinking amongst investors today: The competition is intense to land the hottest AI startups, so VCs must promise lots of capital and do it quickly. This could help explain why some AI startups are raising money at unprecedented rates.
Conover previously co-created Databricks’ open source AI model, Dolly, and his co-founder Brandon Kotara (pictured above; left) previously led machine learning projects at Workday. The startup wouldn’t disclose much about the models it uses, and also refused to share details about the public and licensed data the startup uses to generate its financial research reports.
However, it seems more than likely that Brightwave’s AI agent is pulling some of its information from news articles. Other AI startups, such as Perplexity, have been accused of repurposing information from journalists into products that compete with media companies.
Conover does not see news organizations as a competitor, saying his startup “would never sidestep paywalls.” For now, the CEO says Brightwave is excited to work with the world’s best news organizations in a way that respects the rights of content producers."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/infinite-machine-raises-9m-a16z-led-round-to-convince-americans-to-buy-scooters/,Infinite Machine raises $9M a16z-led round to convince Americans to buy scooters | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-29,"Infinite Machine turned many heads when it revealed its metallic, cyberpunk-style electric scooter in 2023. Now one of Silicon Valley’s biggest venture capital firms is backing the startup’s vision of filling the world’s cities with Infinite Machine’s futuristic vehicles in a big way.
The New York-based startup has closed a $9 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz’s American Dynamism team as it preps for production and initial deliveries next year of the $10,000 “launch edition” of its P1 scooter. Also participating in the round were VC firms Adjacent and Necessary Ventures, as well as the founders of womenswear company Reformation, software platform Replit, and AI startup Hugging Face.
“While others are kind of leaning out [of hard tech], they’re leaning in,” Joseph Cohen, who co-founded Infinite Machine with his brother Eddie, told TechCrunch in a recent interview about securing a16z as an investor. “They want to do hard things, and they recognize a kindred spirit in what we’re doing.”
This is an interesting choice for this a16z unit, which is better known for its defense tech investments like Anduril or Skydio. However, the gist of the American Dynamism thesis is to back tech that improves American lives through everything from defense to manufacturing.
“The cities of the future are going to look very different, and companies like Infinite Machine are pushing the boundaries on building futuristic urban transit with their first product P1,” David Ulevitch, general partner at a16z American Dynamism, said in a statement to TechCrunch. “I’m excited to back the Cohen brothers as they bring form, function and sustainability to the next generation of mobility.”
[Joseph ] Cohen is entering the mobility world after spending a decade running his previous startup Universe, a no-code website service. Infinite Machine is, perhaps, a bold move into a market that has recently struggled. Scooter company Bird, electric motorcycle startup Cake, and e-bike darling VanMoof have all gone through bankruptcy restructuring processes since the pandemic began. Others have completely gone out of business.
Cohen said he’s not fazed, and that he thinks now is a “way better” time to try to sell U.S. customers on electric two-wheelers.
“A lot of those companies wasted a lot of money, and a lot of investors are therefore wary of the category because of those early failures,” he said. “But the way we look at it is, wow, this is amazing, like we get to benefit from all those learnings for free, and we get to hire their best people, and we get to build and use all their infrastructure that already exists.”
That said, Cohen acknowledged Infinite Machine is “not a consensus bet,” meaning it’s not the kind of business VCs were pounding the doors down to fund again. Many companies have tried to sell U.S. customers on the scooter form factor, and almost none have succeeded. Fellow New York startup Revel completely abandoned its scooter business in New York City in favor of operating a more traditional ride-hailing fleet of Tesla EVs. Others, like Taiwanese company Gogoro, have avoided coming stateside altogether. Even Piaggio, the maker of the famous Vespa scooter, has failed to make an impact with its electric offering in the U.S.
Cohen pointed out that most of those companies operate very different businesses from what Infinite Machine is building, which is quite simply a direct sales model. Although the brothers have big goals, they want to start small, even hand-delivering the vehicles to customers instead of outsourcing delivery and logistics from the get go.
Cohen also noted that Infinite Machine is not trying to do everything on its own. The company is outsourcing a lot of componentry, and even its manufacturing, to companies outside the U.S. (He declined to say where the scooters will be built initially.)
The brothers have ideas to bring some of those processes in-house in the future — including potentially manufacturing the vehicles at a 13,000-square-foot headquarters across the river from Manhattan.
For now, they’re content with focusing on product design and marketing. In fact, Cohen thinks that focus will help activate consumers who may be (or have already been) indifferent to the idea of using an electric scooter to get around. They don’t even use the word scooter in their marketing — instead calling it a “radical new personal electric vehicle” and, in some places, a “non-car.”
Cohen said he thinks that will help Infinite Machine distance itself from other companies that have tried and failed to make the form factor succeed in the U.S.
“We think that what we can bring as an American company is an amazing product sensibility that doesn’t exist with the products in the market, and that’s the angle that we’re taking,” he said. “We are coming into this category and saying, you know, these plastic things that look like printers, we can do it better. We can make something that feels like your favorite car — but not a car, but something that extends to the city.”
In that sense, he said, “We are much more like a Rivian or a Tesla than we are like a Revel.”
With those comparisons in mind, Infinite Machine’s plan of attack is no surprise. It’s starting with an incredibly high-priced vehicle, but it hopes to move into more affordable categories as it scales.
“You know, we’re brothers. This is what we want to do for the foreseeable future, and we are planning to operate this company for the rest of our career,” Eddie Cohen told TechCrunch. “All the decisions that we make are in service of that. That’s why we’re so obsessive with the product, because we know that the product is everything, and we have to build consumer trust over the long run.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/salesforce-ai-chatbot-agentforce-hits-general-availability/,Salesforce AI chatbot Agentforce hits general availability | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-29,"Salesforce on Tuesday announced the general availability of its AI agent development platform called Agentforce. The offering is, in essence, a low- or no-code method for deploying chatbots for employees or customers.
Salesforce says the new platform is already being used by firms including OpenTable, Saks, and Wiley.
“Agentforce doesn’t depend on human engagement to get work done,” Salesforce writes in a release tied to the news. “These agents can be triggered by changes in data, business rules, or pre-built automations.” The company’s site, on the other hand, highlights the new offering as more of a symbiosis between people and bots, stating, “humans with Agents drive customer success together.”
Salesforce goes on to note in the release that, “Agentforce goes beyond chatbots and copilots.” While “copilot” is common parlance in the world of AI chatbots, it might be read as a dig at Microsoft, which released 10 new AI agents for Dynamics 365 just over a week ago. CEO Marc Benioff explicitly called out its chief enterprise competitor.
The executive recently referred to Microsoft’s tools as “Clippy 2.0,” comparing Copilot to Word’s polarizing anthropomorphic paperclip. Benioff accused the AI offers of inaccuracies and “spill[ing] corporate data.” Agentforce, it should be noted, is the successor to Salesforce’s own similarly branded Einstein Copilot.
AI has become central to Salesforce’s strategy, like countless others in the enterprise space.
Slack CEO Denise Dresser — who joins TechCrunch onstage at Disrupt on Tuesday — has positioned her parent company’s AI offerings as the centerpiece of a bid to transform Slack into more than just a work chat platform. Agentforce is a big piece of what Dresser has taken to calling a “work operating system.”
Included in Tuesday’s general availability is Agentforce Service Agent, a kind of self-service offering for customers. That offering starts at $2 per conversation. Agent Builder, meanwhile, is essentially what it sounds like, letting users create custom agents built atop templates."

Her remarks follow a petition calling for an end to the unlicensed use of creative works to train AI models that’s now amassed more than 31,000 signatures. But Atwood’s relaxed posture on the march of the machines isn’t solely down to age; it’s informed by her critical appraisal of AI’s output in certain artistic domains.
“So far, AI is a cr*p poet,” she told the news agency. “Really bad. Like worse than people. And it’s not a very good fiction writer either.”
She also dismissed the notion that AI’s literary abilities will improve, intoning: “You will never get an original creator out of AI because it’s a data scraper.”
“But if I were 30, I’d be worried,” she added. “Especially if I were 30… and in the visual arts. If I were a graphic designer, I would be worried.”"

The Series C round was led by Development Partners International’s African Development Partners (ADP) III fund.
Other investors, including African private equity firm Verod Capital and existing investor Lightrock, also participated.
Moniepoint, also backed by QED Investors, British International Investment (BII), and Endeavor Catalyst, has raised over $180 million since its launch in 2015.
According to the Financial Times, the round makes Moniepoint a unicorn — a private company with a valuation of $1 billion or more. The African fintech was last valued slightly over $800 million in a QED-led round two years ago.
Moniepoint initially focused on providing infrastructure and payment solutions for banks and financial institutions before pivoting to becoming a business banking provider, an area where it has found remarkable success.
The African fintech caters to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) across Nigeria, offering working capital, business expansion loans, and business management tools such as expense management (business payment cards), accounting and bookkeeping solutions, and insurance.
The fintech, which powers most of Nigeria’s point-of-sale (POS) transactions as the country’s largest merchant acquirer, claims it processes over 800 million transactions, with monthly total value exceeding $17 billion.
Moniepoint says it will use the new funding to accelerate its growth across Africa (90% of its business comes from Nigeria) as it builds digital payments, banking, foreign exchange (FX), credit, and business management tools. The 9-year-old fintech recently forayed into the personal banking market and claims to have seen 20x customer growth over the past year."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/infraspeak-raises-19-5m-to-bring-collaboration-to-facilities-management/,Infraspeak raises $19.5M to bring collaboration to facilities management | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-29,"It might not be the sexiest of subjects, but facilities management is central to any business that has a physical premises — the bigger that footprint becomes, the more complex it gets.
Portuguese startup Infraspeak has set out to address that with an all-in-one platform that gives facility managers and associated service providers insights and operational control over everything that goes on in a given location.
Founded in 2015, Infraspeak has hitherto raised around $20 million in funding and secured big-name customers such as KFC, InterContinental, and Primark. And to drive its next phase of growth, the Porto-based startup on Monday said it has raised a further €18 million ($19.5 million) in Series B funding.
Consider a healthcare firm with myriad departments, equipment, and contractors spanning various disciplines such as maintenance and cleaning — a lot needs to be coordinated and managed.
“Managing all these moving parts is challenging, and the stakes are quite high,” Infraspeak’s co-founder and CEO, Felipe Ávila da Costa, told TechCrunch. “They [facility managers] must track everything from preventive maintenance schedules to work orders, cleaning tasks, contractor communication, air quality management, service level agreements, room preparation, and performance reporting — all while ensuring compliance with health and safety standards.”
Of course, companies have managed all this for a long time before the digital era, but the task still required significant manual processes and disjointed systems that were prone to human error. Even in more recent times, companies could combine spreadsheets and disparate software designed for specific tasks.
This gets to the crux of what Infraspeak is building: a centralized conduit that joins the dots between systems and processes, allowing all stakeholders to collaborate in one place.
This is made possible with a shared workspace, dubbed Infraspeak Network. In addition to letting facility managers manage internal work such as building operations and connecting teams, the workspace also links directly to external service providers — letting managers request quotes from suppliers, on-board them, assign work orders, and track progress. Service providers, meanwhile, can use Infraspeak to send quotes, communicate with clients, share operational data, and more.
“As a collaborative facilities management platform, Infraspeak enables facilities teams to manage the entire operation cohesively — it allows facilities managers, staff, and contractors to collaborate in a shared digital workspace,” da Costa said. “Whether sharing real-time data, managing work orders, or tracking job execution, every stakeholder is connected, reducing miscommunication and bottlenecks.”
With the rise of remote work, it would be easy to assume that demand for technology to help manage commercial buildings might not be as high as it used to be. Ignoring the fact that many companies are demanding that workers return to their in-office desks, the truth is there are countless facilities that need management apart from office buildings — from shopping malls and hospitals to airports and factories.
“The remote work trend hasn’t significantly impacted our business,” da Costa said. “If anything, remote work has made cloud-based facilities management software more essential — it enables operational managers to control multiple facilities without being constantly on-site. And if we consider one of the main factors that drove the remote work trend in the first place (i.e., the pandemic), then the importance of this kind of software becomes even clearer, as it enables managing building occupancy, enforcing health and safety protocols, or adjusting cleaning schedules based on space usage.”
Infraspeak competes with other startups such as MaintainX, UpKeep, and Facilio, which have all raised significant venture investment in recent years — indicating growing demand for better facilities management tooling. Da Costa also pointed to a number of factors that could be driving this demand, including the increasing complexity of managing buildings due to the fact that they now have more devices and data pouring through them than ever before.
In tandem, companies have come under increasing pressure to optimize operations to meet strict sustainability and ESG targets.
“Overall, buildings now tend to have more advanced systems, stricter regulations, large supplier networks, growing sustainability concerns, and pressure to be cost-efficient and transparent to building users,” da Costa said.
Infraspeak counts around 182 employees (or “Infraspeakers,” as it calls them) across offices in Porto, London, Barcelona, and Florianópolis, and some staff are based remotely elsewhere in South America and Europe. With the fresh $19.5 million in the bank, the company is planning to expand its headcount by a further 100 people in 2025, including C-level positions such as chief revenue officer.
Europe remains Infraspeak’s core focus for now, but the startup is also expanding into South America and Africa. Although the company doesn’t formally operate in the U.S. market, it does claim “a small number” of customers stateside, which could serve as the genesis for expansion later — it may well need to raise more money for that.
“We plan to raise our Series C by 2025, and entering and conquering the U.S. market will definitely be the plan by then,” da Costa said.
Infraspeak’s Series B round was led by Endeit Capital, with participation from Bright Pixel Capital, Caixa Capital, Innovation Nest, and Indico Capital Partners."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/emidat-is-building-a-tool-to-clean-up-construction-by-automating-environmental-reporting/,Emidat is building a tool to clean up construction by automating environmental reporting | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-29,"Fixing the climate crisis is a vast, world-sized puzzle. But one particularly large piece of this ginormous conundrum is construction and real estate — which collectively amount for around 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Enter Munich-based data startup Emidat, which has built a software platform for automating the generation of validated Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) certificates for the construction sector.
EPDs are a critical piece of the puzzle for understanding and mitigating the climate impact of the built environment. They require undertaking a product life cycle assessment (LCA) to declare standardized info about the environmental impact of construction materials and products at each stage of their life cycle, from production through use to end of life.
The problem is that EPDs are typically an arduous and expensive piece of paperwork for manufacturers to produce, says Emidat CEO and co-founder Lisa Oberaigner.
This is where the startup’s data platform comes in, opening up a digital channel for ingesting product data and automating environmental impact declarations via a queryable database that accepts uploads via API, Excel, or BIM (building information modeling), and can itself be accessed via API and UI.
By standardizing the construction sector’s EPD reporting for products, the startup thinks its data layer will fire up the incentive for manufacturers to compete to produce more sustainable buildings materials, helping to shrink the carbon footprint of future builds as a by-product of platform-enabled transparency.
“The really large manufacturers, the ones that are responsible for these emissions, it’s not like they don’t know how to decarbonize; they know exactly what they need to do, and they invest a lot in these new technologies to produce sustainably,” Oberaigner said. “Now they cannot charge for it, and with what we do, they can put a price tag on it — show that it’s actually more sustainable.
“So what we’re building is essentially an incentive structure so that the manufacturers get something for their effort. And I think, right now, this is what the market needs,” she said. “In a couple of years, when we’re not talking about ‘do you have this data available’ … but we’re talking about the actual impact of the materials, then it will be even more important to have the sustainable solutions implemented.”
The startup is also using AI to analyze data ingests so it can present information back to its customers. This includes being able to create industry benchmarks for different products so manufacturers can compare their performance against peers. It also plans to use AI to analyze 3D models so it can produce emissions calculation projections based on analysis of the materials proposed for the construction project.
Emidat’s software-as-a-service platform cuts the time it takes its manufacturer customers to produce an EPD from as long as up to a year currently (using conventional approaches such as where a manufacturer engages a consultancy firm to compile the data and an external verifier to sign off on the declaration), to as little as a week per product, according to Oberaigner.
The cost per EPD (and therefore per product) is also slashed dramatically, she says, down from the circa €15,000 it costs using the conventional multi-step, multi-agency reporting process down to as little as €50 using Emidat’s platform.
Beyond the existential imperative of the climate crisis itself, there is a driving force on the horizon in the form of regulations that will apply across the European Union from early next year — aka the Construction Products Regulation (CPR).
This Pan-EU law brings in sustainability requirements for construction industry products and harmonizes the bloc’s rules for assessing environmental performance. It will also introduce a regime of audits to check the construction industry’s environmental declarations. And Oberaigner suggests the law will help accelerate adoption of Emidat’s platform given how the verification piece is also baked in.
“Essentially, right now, the way [the industry] works is that there is a third party that just looks at the [manufacturer’s product] data that a consultant created, puts their signature under it, and then this is published … The problem is that they all work with different standards,” she said. “So even if you produce the exact same product, and it should be the same results, it’s not at the moment. So our core piece is in making this calculation unified — and this is what the verifier verifies in the first place.”
Oberaigner and her co-founder, CTO Florian Fesch, set out knowing they wanted to found a climate startup but otherwise had a blank slate for what their first company would focus on. Researching impact opportunities, and doing hundreds of interviews around sustainable construction, led them to narrow their search and settle on data reporting for construction as the mission.
They saw a particular opportunity to build a platform geared toward materials manufacturers — getting these key players and their supply chains uploading product data to automate EPDs — as a way to respond to rising demand for environmental impact info that is coming from the architects and project developers who want to improve the sustainability of their projects.
Other approaches in this area had focused on serving the latter customers directly, she suggests, rather than directly supporting manufacturers to report environmental data. Oberaigner name-checks the likes of One Click LCA and Sphera as longtime players selling LCA support services but that are targeted at expert users (rather than manufacturers).
“We’re not the first ones who realize embodied carbon in buildings is a problem, but we’re the first ones to tackle the manufacturers,” she said, adding: “I think this is a really smart starting point, because this is where the data is generated, but this data is then needed along the whole value chain. So we can essentially layer applications on top of this.”
Giving manufacturers the tools to manage their EPD reporting themselves also looks like a smart tactic to lift key emissions data all the way down the supply chain, as the approach requires major manufacturers to ensure their suppliers are providing the necessary data to complete the environmental declarations.
So far, the 2023-founded startup has 25 customers who have used or are using its platform for some 350 construction plans. Its database of materials contains information on over 150,000 construction products, spanning 13 product categories so far. But it’s just getting started.
Oberaigner says Emidat’s initial focus has been onboarding manufacturers of structural components where environmental impact is greatest (e.g., cement/concrete, steel, windows, roofing) — and its customer roster includes “three of the world’s largest concrete manufacturers” (though she didn’t disclose any names).
But she says the company plans to keep expanding the product categories covered. So EPD generation for operational components like building heating and lighting and interior decoration could be added down the line.
Consider how many declarations would be needed to comprehensively cover all the components involved in just a single construction project, and it’s easy to see why a scalable platform that’s able to automate key stages of the EPD process — to both speed it up and radically shrink the cost of reporting — could be transformative in delivering data much more quickly and getting much more of the built environment disclosing critical information on climate impact.
Emidat’s platform streamlines data collection by integrating with manufacturers’ systems via API and then uses those data unloads to automate the generation of the EPD — baking in verification as part of the service.
“[Manufacturers] really need this at scale for hundreds of different products, so the current process just doesn’t work,” Oberaigner said. “Within the European Union, we need to increase the number of EPDs from 30,000 to somewhere in the millions. We don’t really know how many construction products there are, but it’s very, very high. And then outside the European Union, you also have the same standard.”
“[Generating EPDs] is something that nobody else has really done before, because it’s a rather complex document … that explains exactly how everything was calculated,” she said. “And then the calculation needs to be accurate as well. So we make sure that the calculation is accurate for every single product that you want to output, which means that there are a lot of sanity checks in there — everything that a verifier would usually do — so the declaration, again, is autogenerated.”
“We’re the first ones to do this in a fully verified model, meaning that the output is so accurate that the verifier guarantees that anything that comes out of Emidat is verified,” she said. “And that’s very new in the market. It hasn’t really been possible before, and the demand was also not there because it was fine if you did this, like once a year, and then it landed in the drawer. Now we really need this at scale. So it’s the first time, essentially, that people are asking for this kind of solution.”
Emidat runs automated checks on data uploads to its platform to “sanity check” that the data customers are providing is accurate and is within certain thresholds; if not, it flags the upload to the customer.
It also has a staffer doing sample checks of data uploads as another accuracy check. But, from next year, regional audits will be the norm as the industry gets regulated under the EU’s CPR.
The startup thinks that just the European market for EPDs could be worth at least €5 billion a year, based on the cost of producing a verified certificate for 500,000 construction products — though it says it’s estimated that manufacturers will need to create 25x the amount of all the EPDs that have been published so far as environmental regulations dial up. So the regional market for environmental declarations in construction looks set for serious heat.
In the U.S., for example, the Biden-Harris administration announced a $100 million fund for cleaner manufacturing last year that’s providing grant support to U.S.-based manufacturers to produce EPDs. And Oberaigner says EPDs are also being used in Asia and Australia, so there’s global alignment on the approach.
Data reporting itself can be a catalyst for change. Emidat therefore thinks its platform will help reshape incentives for the construction sector to compete and innovate on producing and using more sustainable products.
Having a proper picture of the data by making it easier to report and generate EPDs is the flywheel for industry change, Oberaigner predicts. “What it really does eventually is it creates a competition between manufacturers that is based on environmental impact, and that is what we find really exciting.”
In a year’s time, she says Emidat hopes to be reaching some 200 customers; she suggests that would be the tipping point for the platform to unlock other business opportunities, such as by being able to support architects and developers to choose more sustainable materials for their project.
“We think of ourselves as a data company, because we think there will be a self-reinforcing wheel,” she said. “The reason why the manufacturers create this data is because they want to share it and because they want to differentiate through it. And when they use our platform to share the data we have this other side — of project developers and architects choosing the materials through Emidat, so comparing materials through Emidat.”
“We think that once we have a really good base on the manufacturer side — so we have the best database for the materials, and we also have a really good database on the architect project developer side — it’s really, really hard to beat us. Because every new manufacturer will see, oh, all my customers are working with Emidat, so I might as well.”
Emidat is announcing a €4 million seed round, which it closed this summer, led by U.S. VC giant General Catalyst.
Commenting in a statement, Samuel Beyer, investor at the firm, said: “We see Emidat as a turnkey solution for decarbonizing the mission-critical built environment from the ground up; it will increasingly function as a collaborative platform where the industry can collectively access and exchange material data. We believe this will help drive the speed of industry transformation and value chain efficiency.”
Prior to this, Emidat raised a €500,000 pre-seed last summer, with backing coming from several unicorn founders and two Atomico angels, among others.
The latest funding injection will go on ramping up on the commercial side ahead of the EU regulation biting early next year, as well as continued product development. “Closing the largest names in the highest emitting product verticals,” is the plan, Oberaigner said.
Given the pressing need for the construction industry to be reporting carbon emissions, why hasn’t there been more startup action to this problem before? Oberaigner suggests a combination of factors have hampered progress to date: the choice of which customers to target and timing, with relevant regulations only set to bite soon.
“One piece of it is it’s more intuitive to go to the data user, so the architect and the project developer, because they’re the ones making the material choices,” she said, saying this had been her assumption, too, when the two founders started looking into the market.
On the contrary, they learned through the 400 or so interviews they conducted during their market research phase that pressure to serve up data was being pushed onto manufacturers. Which underscores the value of proper customer research.
“I think a lot of startups have tried the data user side, and that currently is really tough because they don’t have the urgency yet,” she suggested. “And then on the manufacturer side, it’s really a new need. So the regulation is only coming up now. It’s really hard to find this right timing.”
“For us, it was very conviction driven,” she added. “Because if you look at the emissions in construction, it’s just a no-brainer that something needs to happen there. And in many industries, the urgency is not yet as big, because regulation looks again where the emissions are big first.”
Asked how she thinks the built environment will change — as we get a better handle on the environmental impacts of different construction materials — she points to “sustainable concrete” as key to decarbonizing the sector, as well as agreeing that wooden buildings are likely to become a lot more common."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/google-backed-open-cloud-coalition-launches-to-lobby-european-lawmakers/,Google-backed Open Cloud Coalition launches to lobby European lawmakers | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-28,"Europe has a new lobbying body, one with a self-stated mission to “improve competition, transparency and resilience” in the cloud computing sector.
The Open Cloud Coalition (OCC) counts 10 members at launch, the most notable of which is Google, supported by international and local cloud providers Centerprise International, Civo, Gigas, ControlPlane, DTP Group, Prolinx, Pulsant, Clairo and Room 101. Part of the collective’s work will involve conducting cloud market research and presenting the results to regulators in the European Union and the U.K., while “engaging in consultations on competition and market fairness,” according to a statement.
The launch comes hours after Microsoft’s deputy general counsel Rima Alaily preempted the announcement, publishing a blog post accusing Google of conducting a “shadow campaign” to influence cloud regulation in Europe. Alaily called the new organization an “astroturf group organized by Google,” adding that the search giant had “gone through great lengths to obfuscate its involvement, funding and control” by using smaller European cloud providers as the face of the coalition.
The OCC is broadly comparable to another industry trade organization called the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), which launched in 2017 and has Amazon’s AWS as its flagship member alongside several dozen smaller players. Indeed, the OCC is a direct response to a settlement Microsoft reached with CISPE members (not including AWS) to abandon an antitrust complaint against a licensing change Microsoft had made in 2019, which made it more expensive to run its enterprise software on rival cloud services.
That July settlement, which reportedly included a $22 million payment and promises to make it easier for smaller cloud providers to run Microsoft software on their own infrastructure, spurred Google to launch its own complaint with the European Commission (EC). The complaint alleged that Microsoft uses anti-competitive licensing practices to force companies into staying on its Azure cloud infrastructure.
The OCC’s launch comes at an opportune time. A new European Commission is set to take office, and the U.K. is also carrying out an in-depth cloud market investigation of vendor lock-in practices. AWS and Microsoft are in the lens of the investigation as the market leaders, and the results are expected to be published in 2025.
Heading up the Coalition is Nicky Stewart, public sector director of U.K. cloud hosting company Civo. He says that with cloud infrastructure becoming the norm, businesses are increasingly finding themselves “trapped in restrictive agreements, facing high costs and barriers” when trying to switch providers.
“The OCC is determined to reverse this trend by promoting a more competitive and flexible market and driving the adoption of open standards,” Stewart said in a statement.
Microsoft insists that Google is the main driving force of the OCC in terms of support, but DGA Group, an “advisory firm” enlisted to drive recruitment for the Coalition, said it wasn’t disclosing individual members’ contributions. However, DGA noted that the total funding would eventually be made public through the EU Transparency Register."

These startups are creating technologies in areas that are meant to be built, used, and create jobs in the country of origin, like the US. They cover everything from aerospace and critical infrastructure to government, manufacturing and national safety.
This panel at Disrupt 2024 with Dcode Capital Managing Partner Rebecca Gevalt, Albedo Co-founder & CEO Topher Haddad, and Biofire Founder & CEO Kai Kloepfer digs into how far — and how fast — Silicon Valley can rebuild a nation’s foundations.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/this-veteran-couldnt-share-3d-scans-of-a-burnt-naval-ship-so-he-created-a-startup-that-can/,"This veteran couldn't share 3D scans of a burnt naval ship, so he created a startup that can | TechCrunch",Maxwell Zeff,2024-10-28,"In the summer of 2020, a fire broke out onboard a naval ship docked in San Diego Bay. For more than four days, the USS Bonhomme Richard burned as helicopters dropped buckets of water from above, boats spewed water from below, and firefighters rushed onboard to control the blaze. Before the embers had even cooled, lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) scans were taken to assess how bad the damage was and to figure out how the fire even started.
But the investigation was stalled, partially because of how hard it is to send lidar scans.
Today’s leading cloud storage services — Google Drive, DropBox, iCloud, and OneDrive — don’t support the massive three dimensional files (sometimes, multiple terabytes in size) used with lidar technology. The naval unit in San Diego was forced to overnight thumb drives and Blu-ray discs, containing lidar scans of the charred naval ship, to authorities around the country.
That’s what inspired U.S. Army veteran Clark Yuan to launch Stitch3D, a browser-based platform that lets you view, share, annotate, interact with, and manage your large 3D files. Each file is stored as a “point cloud”: a collection of millions of discrete points with x, y, and z coordinate values that digitally represent a 3D scene. If Stitch3D existed, it may have been easier to send lidar scans of the USS Bonhomme Richard.
Stitch3D pitched on the Startup Battlefield stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024.
Yuan, who worked on lidar systems during his service, was helping the Navy improve its 3D modeling systems around the time disaster struck the USS Bonhomme Richard. This wasn’t the first time Yuan saw the inefficiencies of transmitting lidar files. In his Army days, Yuan remembers how some soldiers would run around with backups filled with hard drives holding lidar scans.
However, the U.S. military views lidar scans as critical in some situations, largely for preparing humans with accurate maps and equipment for a mission’s terrain.
Lidar creates 3D mappings of landscapes by measuring how long it takes light beams to bounce off a solid surface. Whereas aerial photos can only create 2D photos, lidar can show height or depth as well. The technology can show where large holes are in a battlefield, the elevation gain of a mountain, or the height of a building in a city. The advancement of drone technology has made it much easier to collect these lidar scans.
Stitch3D secured a $1.8 million grant from the Air Force to develop its technology in a secure way, alongside a $750,000 pre-seed round raised from friends and family. The Air Force wants to use it to measure coastal erosion for air bases in Florida or assess airfield damage after attacks.
However, Yuan sees Stitch3D as more than a military application.
In a demo with TechCrunch, Yuan shared how you could use Stitch3D’s platform to navigate around a detailed 3D map of a college campus. The platform allows you to view 3D maps from various angles, measure the dimensions of buildings and geographic features, and annotate different areas with notes and colors.
Yuan also says Stitch3D could be used by anyone else who uses lidar, including industries such as forestry, mining, architecture, land surveying, oil drilling, and more.
Augmented reality (AR) is another space Stitch3D could one day break into, using the lidar sensor on the back of your phone (yes, your phone has one) to create interactive scans of objects or rooms. Yuan said there’s a big uphill battle for developing that right now, and they’ve chosen not to because the technology is so young. However, one day, he could see how Stitch3D’s point clouds could be used with AR devices."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/vinod-khosla-calls-out-trumps-depraved-values-and-musks-role-in-spreading-misinformation/,Vinod Khosla calls out Trump's 'depraved values' and Musk's role in spreading misinformation | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-10-28,"Storied investor Vinod Khosla, founder and partner at Khosla Ventures, and more recently one of the first checks into OpenAI, veered off topic during a Monday interview at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 focused on the future of AI. After talking about AI’s future and risks, he took a moment to deliver a stringent warning about the upcoming U.S. election and what’s at stake for the country.
In short, “our democracy is definitely on the line,” he said, alongside other harsh words for anyone who supported Trump — including Elon Musk.
“I can’t believe [Musk is] supporting somebody with such depraved values as Trump,” Khosla told the crowd at the conference. “I can’t imagine anyone who values ‘values’ voting for Trump,” he continued. “He’s so depraved, it’s unimaginable to me. But obviously Trump is tapping into a vein of discontent that’s very real.”
Murmurs of surprise at the fierce nature of his statements, laughter, and scattered applause rippled through the audience of mainly entrepreneurs.
The investor went on to explain why he believes the U.S. is in the position it’s in, saying that when there’s large enough discontent, people are more open to believing in anything or relying on their “own set of facts.”
He pointed to the recent misinformation circulating about FEMA in the wake of the devastating hurricanes that hit multiple states in the U.S., which had falsely claimed that the money offered by the U.S. government was actually being sent elsewhere.
Khosla pointed out that the lack of a shared set of facts was the source of this kind of misinformation. He brought up Trump’s claims of a “stolen” election as another example of this problem.
“If you say it was [stolen], I don’t really want to talk to you because we don’t share facts,” the investor noted.
Khosla also held Elon Musk, in particular, accountable for helping spread this type of misinformation on X. (Or Twitter, as Khosla referred to it, saying “I still call it Twitter.”)
After crediting Musk for his entrepreneurship — for things like electric cars and “catching that rocket with chopsticks” — he then shamed the billionaire for ignoring “all the depravity of Trump — the fact that he’s a convicted felon, charged rapist, I could go on and on,” Khosla said with vitriol.
He referenced how Musk had helped spread Trump’s misinformation, like the bizarre claim that immigrants were eating your pets.
“How ridiculous can you get? I don’t know how to communicate on that front,” Khosla said. “I don’t know what the right counter-answer is.”
Khosla, of course, has been feuding with Musk publicly and not just on the topic of the upcoming election. The two battled over a land use issue, where Musk had challenged him over making a formerly public beach parking lot private, for instance.
(Asked if Musk’s recent behavior has influenced his choices, Khosla noted “I bought my Tesla before Elon went crazy.”)
Musk and Trump criticism aside, Khosla said that the U.S. election may not have that much impact on the tech industry, specifically.
“I don’t see where their policies will be different,” he said, referring to both the right and left.
“It will be different in how we tax people, how we share wealth, what we do about the bottom 50% of the people in this country. It will be very different for them,” Khosla said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/mablabs-improved-drug-and-drink-testing-strips-could-make-for-safer-streets-and-venues/,MabLab's improved drug and drink testing strips could make for safer streets and venues | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-28,"For anyone who parties or goes out dancing, the risk of accidentally taking adulterated drugs is a real one. MabLab, presenting today on the Startup Battlefield stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, has created a testing strip that detects the five most common and dangerous additives in minutes.
Co-founders Vienna Sparks and Skye Lam met in high school, and during college the pair lost a friend to overdose. It’s a story that, sadly, many people (including myself) can identify with. Thankfully, testing strips are a common sight now at venues and health centers, with hundreds of millions shipping yearly.
If you haven’t seen them, the strips work like this: You dissolve a bit of the substance to be tested in a provided buffer solution, then dip the strip in. The liquid travels up the paper, reaching a treated area that changes color in the presence of an unwanted additive. They’re simple and effective, but limited in that they only detect one thing, most commonly fentanyl.
“We have an opportunity to replace that with a better version,” said Lam — one that detects five common lacing chemicals simultaneously: fentanyl, methamphetamine, benzodiazepine, xylazine, and methadone.
The company’s innovation is “a mix of physical and chemical,” said Sparks: “There’s a zone specifically designed for each agent, and we’re using novel treatments and materials on the strip to allow capillary action to occur without incurring cross-reactivity.”
That is to say, the different zones and chemical sensitivities won’t set each other off or prevent the others from activating.
If it all works as described, it would be an across-the-board improvement to what’s out there.
MabLab’s plan is to distribute its strips the same way everyone else has, and to leverage the manufacturing infrastructure that already exists. No need to reinvent the wheel, just do it better and give it a push. But they believe that this kind of testing is also a growth market, and not just due to an increase in laced drugs.
“We’re seeing a cultural change: people on campuses and at music festivals encouraging friends to test,” Sparks said. People are aware there’s a threat, and a way to be safer that isn’t abstinence — an approach that is, for drugs or other practices, seldom adopted by teens and college kids.
“It’s very similar to condom distribution,” said Lam; a proven way to mitigate risk is to give people the opportunity to do things safely and then get out of the way.
“University health systems, harm reduction centers, these places will buy strips in bulk. You walk in, grab a few, and walk out, no questions asked,” he continued. “These are organizations that will subsidize the cost; in New York City they spend $16 million just on test strips, and in California they’ve dedicated budget to it. A lot of this is coming from a 2022 act that gave billions to fund harm reduction tools.”
It’s not just young folks — quick, specific drug purity testing could be helpful at veteran’s centers, homeless shelters, needle exchanges, and for emergency services like EMTs. After all, if you’re responding to an overdose, as many departments do daily, it helps to be able to say with certainty what the patient is overdosing on. Sparks said they’re even in talks with Coachella and other music festivals.
“Looking toward the future, the biggest thing is getting those [letters of intent] that already have distribution channels in place,” said Sparks — like universities and clinics. As for actually making the strips, she credited the huge expansion of medical testing supply chains for the ability to produce them in bulk.
The startup has already begun hiring its team, and is focused on getting its first shipments out the door. If this supercharged new testing method hits the ground running, MabLab could corner the market while making people safer around the world."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/step-aside-zoom-fatigue-vrtl-wants-to-make-virtual-fan-events-fun-again/,"Step aside, Zoom fatigue, VRTL wants to make virtual fan events fun again | TechCrunch",Amanda Silberling,2024-10-28,"VRTL founder Courtney Jeffries describes herself as a “recovering sports executive.”
“That was my entire career before I threw it away to chase down my startup dreams,” Jeffries told TechCrunch.
After playing softball at the University of Washington, she spent almost 20 years working in marketing and sales for teams like the Oakland Raiders and the New York Rangers. But while Jeffries was leading fan retention initiatives at Madison Square Garden, she noticed a glaring opportunity.
“My whole job was to focus on extracting the lifetime value out of the fans, but quite obviously, there’s an over indexing of attention on fans in the building,” she said. “The majority of fans are outside of an arena […] and there’s no platform, no way to scale in-person experiences that we know will trigger their loyalty.”
By 2022, Jeffries launched VRTL, an enterprise platform for entertainment companies — from sports teams to record labels — to capitalize on virtual fan experiences.
“It’s a very versatile platform that combines livestream, video chat, and then our proprietary suite of fan engagement experiences to drive those loyalties,” she said.
What makes VRTL, which pitched onstage today as part of the Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, different from any other video chat or livestream service is not only that it gives clients valuable data, but also that it has proprietary fan engagement tools.
One popular feature allows celebrities to sign autographs virtually for fans — for example, a soccer star might sign a .gif of an iconic play, personalizing it for each individual fan. On the management end, holding a virtual meet and greet is a lot less costly than an in-person one, which requires venue rentals, security, and staffing, not to mention that it only involves local fans.
“Why can’t we just do this on a Zoom?” Jeffries said. “Sure, you can, but Zoom is optimized for office work. It isn’t optimized for fans.”
She added that when organizations have hosted pilot events on VRTL, they have a 60% conversion rate to become paying customers.
One such customer is the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons, who use VRTL to host meet and greet events between season ticket holders and former Falcons players.
“They’ve created this monthly experience that if your birthday is that month, they have an exclusive event for you with former players that are hosting, yucking it up for about 25 minutes, sharing the war stories, and then they go sign autographs for these fans,” Jeffries said. “Sometimes they sing ‘Happy Birthday,’ and it’s the easiest thing you’ve ever seen. But all of these fans love it because it’s for them.”
VRTL sells annual contracts to its clients, which are tiered in price depending on the kinds of events they want to host. Customers have unlimited use of the platform, and they’re allowed to bring in sponsors, too.
The Falcons aren’t VRTL’s only big-name customer. They’ve also done deals with the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Minnesota Twins, ESPN, Atlanta United FC, and others. For the Jaguars, VRTL helped the football team cultivate a fanbase in London, where the team has played four games over the last two years.
When the entertainment and sports industries have been following the same playbooks for so long, it can be a challenge for new ideas like remote fan engagement to break through. But Jeffries isn’t worried. She’s seen these juggernauts change their ways before.
“When I worked for the Raiders, I was there the day that Twitter launched. Everyone was like, ‘What the hell, no one’s going to communicate in 140 characters,” she said. “It is now unheard of for a team or league to launch without a social media manager… within my career lifetime, this has happened.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/dglegacy-wants-to-help-you-ensure-your-loved-ones-inherit-your-assets/,DGLegacy wants to help you ensure your loved ones inherit your assets | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-28,"DGLegacy, a company that’s designed a digital legacy planning and inheritance app, pitched today at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 Startup Battlefield to detail how it’s helping people ensure that their loved ones inherit their assets.
Founded by husband-and-wife duo Ana Mineva and Peter Minev, DGLegacy allows users to proactively inform their beneficiaries of their assets and ensure they are aware of their passwords and other information in order to claim them. The idea behind the app is to minimize the chance of an unclaimed asset.
Unlike traditional asset protection tools like trusts and wills, which can become outdated soon after their creation, DGLegacy lets you keep a continuously updated catalog of your assets and ensures that beneficiaries will always have access to it.
With DGLegacy, you can catalog your assets and upload relevant files to the respective asset. You can then invite beneficiaries and trustees to ensure that they will be informed about their designated assets.
The app features multi-layer encryption to ensure that all of the information is stored securely.
“The most important thing about DGLegacy is that it allows you to not only catalog very securely and easily your digital assets, but also has a proprietary protocol for detecting a fatal event,” Peter told TechCrunch. “Only when a fatal event is detected, then we trigger the digital inheritance.”
DGLegacy detects a fatal event through several different measures. If you connect the app to your social networks, it monitors your public posts to ensure you’re alive. If you have given the app access to biometric logins, DGLegacy monitors your logins. If the app notices a pause in both of these things, DGLegacy sends you an email to check in on you. If the company still doesn’t hear from you, it will give you a call.
After a fatal event is confirmed, DGLegacy supports your beneficiaries in the process of identifying, locating, and claiming assets.
Ana and Peter believe that their app can help the everyday person protect their assets and ensure their loved ones can access them once they pass away.
“Let’s be honest, if someone is very rich, they have private bankers,” Peter said. “Our solution is for the middle class, for the regular people, and also people in war zones. We were super surprised when the war in Ukraine started and we had so many signings from Ukraine. We also have quite a lot of sign-ups from Gaza.”
Ana came up with the idea for DGLegacy 15 years before the startup’s official founding in January 2021.
She recalls being nervous before every trip she and Peter took, as she was concerned about what would happen to their children if something terrible were to occur on their travels.
“I invited my mother-in-law to show her all of the files and folders at home and said: ‘If something happens to us, I know you don’t have the money to take care of our kids, please know that we have this and that. So if something happens to us, you have our money to continue to keep the quality of life of our kids’,” Ana told TechCrunch. “This was the very beginning of the ideation of DGLegacy.”
As she was doing this, she remembers thinking to herself that there must be a better way of doing so. While people with high net worths have contingency plans to protect their assets, Ana believed there should be a solution for middle-class families as well.
After doing some research, Ana and Peter discovered that there are tens of billions of dollars of unclaimed cash and benefits in the United States alone in the form of abandoned bank accounts, stock holdings, unclaimed life insurance, and more.
The duo also heard personal stories from people around them who had needed a solution like DGLegacy. For instance, they knew someone whose partner passed away in Dubai and received zero transparency about their partner’s assets and bank account.
Fast-forward to 2017, Peter pitched Ana’s idea to a friend he met at a TechCrunch event in Berlin. Peter told his friend, who worked at Facebook, about Ana’s idea and asked if he had heard of anyone in Silicon Valley working on something to solve the issue. After his friend told him that he was looking for a solution himself and wasn’t aware of anyone working on one, Peter and Ana decided that it was time to bring Ana’s idea to life.
DGLegacy operates on a freemium model. Free users can protect up to three assets and assign one beneficiary per asset, while Gold users get unlimited assets and beneficiaries for $6.99 per month or a one-time fee of $199. For people who want additional protection, DGLegacy offers a Platinum plan with cyber breach monitoring of your assets, the ability to manage assets with your family, dedicated beneficiary support and more for $8.99 a month or a one-time fee of $299.
The startup has been bootstrapped until now, and plans to raise its first VC round later this year or early next year.
DGLegacy is available on iOS and Android."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/vinod-khosla-calls-sb-1047-author-clueless-and-not-qualified-to-regulate-the-real-dangers-of-ai/,Vinod Khosla calls SB 1047 author 'clueless' and 'not qualified' to regulate the real dangers of AI | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-10-28,"Vinod Khosla said the author of California’s recently vetoed AI bill, SB 1047, was clueless about the real dangers of AI, and not qualified to have an opinion on global national security issues. The comment about state Senator Scott Wiener was made during an onstage interview at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024.
“He’s clueless about the real dangers, which are national security issues,” said Khosla, referring to Senator Wiener, who represents San Francisco in California’s legislature. “I’m a huge supporter of him when it comes to his efforts on housing and NIMBYism and stuff. So huge supporter on those issues because they are local issues. This is a global national security issue. He’s not qualified to have an opinion there.”
SB 1047 was a highly controversial AI bill that California’s legislature passed, but Governor Newsom vetoed in the face of opposition from Silicon Valley, Nancy Pelosi, and the United States Department of Commerce. The bill attempted to make AI laboratories liable for the most extreme dangers of their AI models, even if they were not the ones operating them in a dangerous way.
Senator Wiener tells TechCrunch that Khosla’s comments on Monday were “incredibly arrogant” for suggesting that “only AI technologists and mega investors have a right to an opinion” on AI’s societal impact.
“I appreciate Mr. Khosla’s support of my work on housing. For the record, I have no idea how to build a house, so I work with brilliant housing experts to craft smart housing policy,” said Wiener in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “Similarly, in crafting and advancing SB 1047, I worked with some of the top AI experts on the planet, including Geoffrey Hinton, who pioneered machine learning and just won the Nobel Prize in Physics for doing so.”
Many in Silicon Valley, including Khosla, argued that SB 1047 would make technology companies hesitant to release cutting-edge AI models in California, therefore reducing America’s competitive edge in the AI race. Khosla wrote an opinion article in The Sacramento Bee in September arguing this bill could have a global impact on America’s national security, extending beyond the regulatory scope of a California state lawmaker.
Meanwhile, Wiener previously told TechCrunch that venture capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator, had run what he called a propaganda campaign against his bill. He argued that misinformation about the impact of SB 1047, and what the bill actually did, ran wild in recent months, and accused self-interested investors of spreading this misinformation to startup founders and the media.
Khosla went on to say he’d love to debate Wiener if he was here. Wiener is scheduled to speak on AI regulation at Disrupt on Wednesday, though the senator suggested Khosla should debate the AI researcher, Geoffrey Hinton, who supported SB 1047."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/how-advex-creates-synthetic-data-to-improve-machine-vision-for-manufacturers/,How Advex creates synthetic data to improve machine vision for manufacturers | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-28,"Data is pretty much everything when it comes to training AI systems, but accessing enough data to produce quality products that live up to their promise is a major challenge, even for companies with the deepest of pockets.
This is a problem that Advex AI is setting out to address, using generative AI and synthetic data to “solve the data problem,” as the company puts it. More specifically, Advex allows customers to train their computer vision systems using a small sample of imagery, with Advex generating thousands of “fake” pictures from that sample.
Today signals Advex’s formal launch at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 on the Startup Battlefield stage, though it has already secured a handful of customers through its stealth phase. This includes what it calls “seven major” enterprise clients, which it says it’s not at liberty to disclose. TechCrunch can also reveal that the San Francisco-based startup has raised $3.6 million in funding, the bulk of which came via a $3.1 million seed tranche last December, with notable backers including Construct Capital, Pear VC, and Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective.
CEO Pedro Pachuca started Advex with his CTO co-founder Qasim Wani a little over a year ago, and the company has a headcount of six. That such a svelte startup has already made it into the industry with real paying customers is notable, with Pachuca putting at least some of this down to his background, as well as good old-fashioned networking and cold reach-outs. Indeed, Pachuca was previously a machine learning researcher at Berkeley, and later joined the research team at Google Brain before it merged into DeepMind.
“If the ROI [return on investment] makes sense, they’ll [customers] trust us a bit,” Pachuca said. “I have done a lot of research in this space — being at Google Brain before gives me a little bit of credibility. But at the beginning it was cold emails, and that got us our first two big customers. Then it was conferences — that’s why I go to so many of them!”
Pachuca was about to head over to Europe just after concluding his interview with TechCrunch, where he planned to attend various meetings and conferences, including the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) in Milan (Italy) and Vision in Stuttgart (Germany).
“There’s a lot of conferences out there in Europe,” Pachuca said. “We’re going to ECCV to learn and hire, basically,” Pachuca added. “And Vision is more on the industrial side, so we’re there to sell.”
Potential customers include legacy developers of machine vision systems, along the lines of Cognex or Keyence, which are striving to bolster their products with better AI. But on the other side, Advex might sell directly to the end-user businesses, such as car manufacturers or logistics companies building their own in-house tooling.
For example, a car manufacturer might need to teach its computer vision system to recognize defects in the material of their car seats. However, even if the company could access hundreds of distinct images, the fact is that no two defects look the same. So instead, the manufacturer can upload a dozen pictures of seats with tears in them, with Advex extrapolating from that to generate thousands of “defected” seat pictures to build a far more extensive and diverse pool of training data.
The same can be applied to just about any manufacturing sector, from oil and gas to wood furnishings — it’s all about reducing data collection time and costs by artificially creating training imagery.
Synthetic data isn’t a new concept, of course, but with the AI revolution in full swing, businesses are seeking to bridge the data gaps — this includes areas such as market research, where survey samples may be too small, as well as computer vision as we’re seeing with the likes of Advex, among other VC-backed startups such as Synthesis AI and Parallel Domain.
Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of models that Advex deals with. The model that’s deployed at the customer’s site, the one that the customer’s own images train, is just standard off-the-shelf “open source stuff,” as Pachuca puts it. “That’s because they need to be small, and we also don’t believe that the gains come from the architecture of the model — they come from training on the right data,” he said.
But the real secret sauce is in the company’s proprietary diffusion model, similar to something like Midjourney or Dall-E, and is what’s used to create the synthetic data. “That one is custom, and is highly complicated — that’s where we put all of our effort,” Pachuca added.
While Advex’s manufacturing focus is one way it differentiates, it’s really the diffusion model approach where the company sees itself as standing out.
In comparison to other simulation and modeling techniques, such as those aligned with game/physics engines (e.g. Unity), Pachuca says that using diffusion means there is no setup required, and generation takes just seconds per image/label pair — plus it’s far closer to real-life data.
“We’re not just creating any images, we’re creating the images you don’t have — specifically trying to understand what is missing, and creating that,” Pachuca said. “And this ‘what is missing’ part is really hard, and it’s very invisible, but it’s one of the biggest innovations that we’ve made.”"

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/microsoft-accuses-google-of-shadow-campaign-to-influence-cloud-regulation-in-europe/,Microsoft accuses Google of 'shadow campaign' to influence cloud regulation in Europe | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-28,"The European cloud wars are heating up. Microsoft has accused its old foe Google of waging a clandestine war against the Azure cloud company, to curry favor with policymakers and antitrust authorities in Europe.
In a blog post today, Microsoft deputy general counsel Rima Alaily preempted the imminent launch of a new lobby group called the Open Cloud Coalition, which includes Google and several smaller cloud providers. Alaily called the outfit an “astroturf group organized by Google,” alleging that Google had “gone through great lengths to obfuscate its involvement, funding, and control” by positioning smaller European cloud providers as the face of the coalition.
“When the group launches, Google, we understand, will likely present itself as a backseat member rather than its leader,” Alaily writes. “It remains to be seen what Google offered smaller companies to join, either in terms of cash or discounts.”
The Coalition is being led by Nicky Stewart, public sector director of U.K. cloud hosting company Civo. A document for the initiative, published by Microsoft today, shows that global “advisory firm” DGA Group was behind the recruitment drive. DGA confirmed to TechCrunch that the coalition will formally launch Tuesday (October 29). In answer to a query from TechCrunch, a DGA spokesperson added that it wouldn’t be divulging the funding makeup of the organization at the moment.
In a statement issued to TechCrunch, Stewart said that the coalition is “transparent” about its members, noting that the members are listed on its website. However, its website isn’t yet live, though it has said that it includes 10 members, including Google, Civo, Centerprise International, Gigas, ControlPlane, DTP Group, Prolinx, Pulsant, Clairo, and Room 101.
“We are not anti any one company, we are a pro-market coalition that is focused on advocating for principles that will strengthen the marketplace for cloud services in Europe, principally openness and interoperability,” Stewart said. “Any company that shares these values and cares about a healthy and thriving marketplace for cloud should join us.”
The backdrop to all of this is a 2019 licensing change whereby Microsoft made it more expensive to run Microsoft’s enterprise software on rival cloud services. This led the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), a European not-for-profit trade association that includes AWS as a member, to file an antitrust complaint with the European Commission (EC), alleging that Microsoft was using its market dominance to tether customers to Azure.
Microsoft settled with CISPE in July, a move designed to keep regulators at bay, with the deal reportedly including a $22 million payment plus stipulations on how Microsoft will better enable some cloud providers to run Microsoft software on their own infrastructure.
But notably, this agreement excluded all the major cloud hyperscalers, including AWS, Alibaba, and Google. Subsequently, Google (which was not a member of CISPE) filed a separate antitrust complaint against Microsoft last month, alleging that Microsoft was using anti-competitive licensing practices to force companies into staying on its Azure cloud infrastructure — but only after Google reportedly offered CISPE members €470 million to keep its case against Microsoft alive (which they rejected).
Fast-forward to now, Google is on the cusp of launching its own version of CISPE, with lobbying the political powers-that-be in Europe at the heart of its mission. The launch also comes as a new European Commission is set to take office by year’s end, while the U.K. is also in the midst of an ongoing market investigation into cloud vendor lock-in practices, with AWS and Microsoft a core focus of the investigation as the market leaders. The investigation is set to conclude in late 2025.
Alaily said that Google’s lobbying efforts are designed to “distract” from regulatory scrutiny it’s facing elsewhere, including in the U.S. where it’s facing a historic break-up over allegedly monopolizing the search and search advertising markets.
“It seems Google has two ultimate goals in its astroturfing efforts: distract from the intense regulatory scrutiny Google is facing around the world by discrediting Microsoft and tilt the regulatory landscape in favor of its cloud services rather than competing on the merits,” Alaily said.
A Google spokesperson confirmed its membership of the coalition, adding that it has been “very public” about its issues with Microsoft’s cloud licensing practices.
“We and many others believe that Microsoft’s anticompetitive practices lock-in customers and create negative downstream effects that impact cybersecurity, innovation, and choice,” the spokesperson said."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/bret-taylors-customer-service-ai-startup-just-raised-175m/,Bret Taylor's customer service AI startup just raised $175M | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-28,"Sierra, the AI startup co-founded by OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor, has raised $175 million in a funding round that values the startup at $4.5 billion.
Sierra, launched by Taylor and longtime Google exec Clay Bavor, focuses on selling AI-powered customer service chatbots to brands like WeightWatchers and Sirius XM. There’s an “agent” component, as well. The platform connects to other enterprise systems to undertake tasks on behalf of the customer without humans being involved.
There’s certainly no shortage of competition in the chatbot space. But Sierra claims its tech is less susceptible to hallucinations, the made-up facts AI models occasionally spew.
Sierra also lets customers customize its AI’s personality to their corporate brand, using a “constellation” of generative AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, among others, to complete tasks and check for accuracy.
Taylor and Bavor have a long history in customer service tech. Taylor spent nearly a decade at Salesforce, and years ago founded Quip, which Salesforce bought for $750 million in the summer of 2016. Bavor managed Gmail and Google Drive at Google, among other consumer-facing products.
Taylor met Bavor while at Google, where he worked before serving as Facebook’s CTO for several years. At Google, Taylor is widely credited with helping to launch Google Maps. Years later, he’d oversee the Twitter board throughout the social media site’s takeover by Elon Musk.
Investors in Sierra’s latest round included ICONIQ and Thrive Capital. Greenoaks Capital led the round, which brings Sierra’s total raised to $285 million, per Crunchbase.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/netflix-moments-feature-lets-you-save-and-share-clips-from-your-favorite-series/,Netflix’s new ‘Moments’ feature lets you save and share clips from your favorite episodes | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-10-28,"If you’ve ever struggled to explain a scene from your favorite Netflix series or movie to a friend because you couldn’t find the clip online, the streamer just came up with a solution.
Netflix launched on Monday a new clipping feature called “Moments” on its iOS app, letting you quickly save your favorite scenes. Now, you can easily rewatch these scenes or share them on social media platforms with a single tap. Your followers can click the post and be directed to that scene in their own Netflix app.
To save a scene, select “Moments” at the bottom of the screen. It will then be stored in your “My Netflix” tab for later viewing. If you restart the episode, it will begin from that saved scene.
Clip sharing is a popular way for fans to capture memorable moments of their favorite shows, but Netflix places restrictions on taking screenshots or screen recording while streaming. There are plenty of sketchy apps and software you can use instead; however, not everyone wants to take those risks. This feature is also a much better alternative than having to record the TV screen with your phone, often resulting in a grainy, low-quality video.
Many clips of Netflix titles consistently go viral online, attracting new users to the streaming service. (For example, this carriage scene from “Bridgerton.”) With that in mind, the company likely hopes that the introduction of Moments will provide a modest boost in engagement and viewership.
The new feature will roll out to Android devices in the next few weeks.
Netflix’s new feature comes as the streaming giant is likely exploring innovative avenues in a bid to stimulate growth in a highly competitive market. It gained 5.1 million subscribers in the third quarter of 2024, bringing the total to 282 million. This growth, while significant, comes on the heels of an even larger increase of 8 million subscribers in the previous quarter, suggesting that the company is experiencing a slight plateau in its growth trajectory.
The company recently implemented yet another price increase for subscribers.
Separately, Netflix’s gaming arm shut down its AAA video game studio earlier this month, indicating that its goal to develop a high-budget games may be dead or on hold."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/former-disney-star-bridgit-mendler-talks-scaling-connectivity-and-resilience-for-space/,Former Disney star Bridgit Mendler talks scaling connectivity and resilience for space | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-28,"Former Disney Channel star and singer Bridgit Mendler took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 on Monday to detail how her startup, Northwood Space, is investing in a forgotten part of the space industry: ground infrastructure.
Ground stations are the critical communication points for satellites to communicate with Earth. Northwood aims to mass-produce ground stations, as the number and capacity of ground stations are a pressing bottleneck in the space industry.
“To actually fulfill the benefit of people in the world, you have to invest in unsexy problems, like building a ground network,” Mendler said. “I personally think that’s pretty sexy and fun. It’s absolutely not what most people think of when they think of the space industry. I think they think of rockets, they think of satellites, but they don’t think about ground infrastructure.”
Mendler said she spoke to many space startup founders who brought up this idea as an issue for them after their first missions, and they were wondering when a ground station startup would be founded.
The idea behind Northwood Space is creating a data highway between space to accelerate mass adoption of satellite technology. While space companies need connectivity to run their business, ground infrastructure essentially is stuck in the past, which is why Northwood is working to rapidly scale connectivity for space.
“I think there’s been technology shifts that have been kind of difficult to bring to life until very recently,” Mendler said. “So for us, that was something we were kind of tracking with Northwood. There’s this solution that we know we want to build towards; you know, exponential growth needs exponential tech. We need some kind of exponential tech on the ground side to be able to accommodate the growth in the space industry.”
Northwood is aiming to help companies hit the performance levels that support the majority of space missions, and have it at a price point where they can proliferate a network.
Mendler noted that the startup is looking to support reduced collisions and allow for better awareness for spacecraft through increased connectivity. The startup is also focused on working to help satellite operators anticipate failures in advance.
Before adding space startup CEO to her résumé, Mendler was largely known for her hit show “Good Luck Charlie” and her music career. After leaving acting, Mendler studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard Law School.
Despite her many different jobs, Mendler said she has always loved space and felt that she was meant to do something different.
“As a teenager, the thing that felt the most impactful and meaningful was to go beyond TV,” Mendler said. “It was an amazing experience, but there was that nagging thing in the back of my mind about contemplating maybe my impact was also elsewhere. I was actually filming a movie in Massachusetts, and it was nearby the MIT Media Lab, and I went to visit and I was just struck by all these projects really focused on technology and humanity and meaningful progress for the world.”
Mendler then decided to pursue her master’s degree and ended up falling in love with the space sector.
Northwood hit the ground running earlier this year with around $6 million in funding from several investors, including Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, and Also Capital."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/solideon-wants-to-decentralize-rocket-manufacturing-through-3d-printing/,Solideon wants to decentralize rocket manufacturing through 3D printing | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-28,"Nearly five years after COVID-19 ground the world to a halt, the global supply chain still hasn’t fully recovered. Specialty industries like space travel were particularly hard hit, given the impossibility of heading down to the corner to pick up spare rocket parts.
Industries began taking a long, hard look at 3D printing as a solution to such woes. What additive manufacturing lacks in scale, it makes up for both in terms of creating specialty parts and decentralizing a manufacturing industry that is highly concentrated in a handful of locations across the globe.
Solideon co-founder and CEO Oluseun Taiwo saw firsthand the havoc such global events can wreak on the space industry. He was employed as a propulsion engineer in the additive manufacturing division of Virgin Orbit in May 2020, when the company failed to launch its LauncherOne rocket. Virgin Orbit’s journey ended in May 2023.
“What I saw at that time was, if we had a localized way to manufacturer and didn’t have to rely on the global supply chain during a global pandemic, the company would have done better,” Taiwo tells TechCrunch. “There was this hard thing of needing to build something like 30 rockets a year for the business model to work. We were doing maybe three a year, which was never good enough.”
Taiwo left Virgin Orbit in 2021 to work for 3D printing stalwart 3D Systems in 2021, before founding Solideon at Techstars the following year. The Bay Area-based rocket-printing service has raised $6.5 million in funding to date. It’s just a start, given the firm’s celestial ambitions. Solideon presented onstage today as part of the Startup Battlefield 20 at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024.
“What we really do is build robots for deployable microfactories that help 3D-print and assemble large aerospace structures and products,” says Taiwo.
“The reason that matters is you can decentralize manufacturing and actually get closer to building an entire product without any human intervention in the loop. Our long-term goal is to do that anywhere in the solar system at any point.”
Manufacturing for space in space is still a ways off, naturally. In the meantime, the company is focused on solving more immediate-term problems, with an eye on defense contracts. Taiwo notes that the U.S. Defense Department is currently in the process of auditing its own supply chain, in anticipation of further disruption — be it a natural disaster or global conflict.
“The Navy is having the issue with very expensive assets,” he says. “The short term is to go help them solve that problem. The medium term that we’re more focused on is the smaller, autonomous, attributable systems. That’s where we’re seeing the biggest play for technology like this. Building a microfactory that’s very mobile that operates close to where the changing landscape of the conflict is and being able to adapt appropriately.”"

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/level-zero-health-is-working-on-a-potentially-life-changing-device-for-hormone-health/,Level Zero Health is working on a potentially life-changing device for hormone health | TechCrunch,Julie Bort,2024-10-28,"Level Zero Health’s co-founders Ula Rustamova and Irene Jia are swinging for the fences. They are attempting to invent a never-achieved technology that could help millions of people. If they succeed — and there are some positive early indicators — they will create a continuous hormone monitoring medical device.
Such a device could do for hormone health what continuous blood glucose monitors (CGM) have done for diabetes health.
Hormones control just about every aspect of the body, from reproductive health to aging, and influence everything from energy level to mood. “All of that is regulated by your hormones,” CEO Rustamova told TechCrunch. “We know now how much they regulate in terms of your day-to-day life.”
Level Zero, which presented onstage today on the Startup Battlefield stage at Disrupt, is hoping to create this device quickly by adapting the kind of FDA-approved needles used in CGM devices to continuous hormone monitoring. That’s an easy sentence to write. It’s a much harder task to accomplish because the sensors, and even the science behind it, is all just now being developed. Those needles take tiny, sporadic samples of interstitial fluid, or the fluid found in the spaces around cells that leaks out of blood capillaries. Measuring glucose in that fluid for CGM devices is well-established science, but hormones? Not so much. At least, not yet.
Level Zero’s approach is to build a sensor that detects and measures different hormones by scanning what’s known as aptamers. These are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules “that specifically bind to target molecules and undergo reversible conformational changes detectable by electrochemical and optical methods,” CTO Jia explains. In other words, they are building a sensor that can detect the molecule density of a particular hormone by determining how much of it is binding to strands of aptamer DNA.
The first sensors they are working on detect progesterone, estrogen, cortisol, and testosterone. They’ve chosen these hormones because this will allow their first devices to be used for two high needs: IVF treatments and low testosterone. Combined, these represent $30 billion in total addressable markets, the founders say.
While Level Zero is not intending for consumers to buy the devices directly — it will be prescribed by healthcare providers — hormone-testing home kits inspired them. Such kits attempt to measure hormones in urine, sweat, or saliva, but the results are wobbly at best, says Rustamova, who uses the word “pseudo science” to describe much of the home hormone-testing market. “The only possible accurate way to measure hormones is to go take a blood drop,” she tells TechCrunch.
But blood draws are not wholly helpful either, as they only measure hormone levels at that one snippet in time. They won’t help with a wide range of questions like “Is my contraception working?” or  “Okay, I think my testosterone is low, but I don’t know if my exercise is helping or lowering it,” Rustamova explains.
The company is less than a year old, and hasn’t published any peer-reviewed papers on the progress of its work. So the public can’t know yet if what they are building will do what they hope it does. Level Zero is still keeping its technology close to the vest with an eye toward a patent, Rustamova says.
However, there are indications that its scientific approach is sound. Scientists from the Department of Nanoscience at the University of North Carolina published a paper in 2016 that documented how they successfully used aptamers to measure progesterone. By 2022, scientists in Hyderabad, India, had successfully created a low-cost sensor.
Level Zero has also assembled an impressive group of medical experts as advisors, the founders tell TechCrunch. These include Dr. Aaron Styer, Harvard associate professor and medical director of infertility clinic CCRM Boston; Dr. Kelly Walker, a urologist who works with Hims and as medical director of digital male fertility management platform Posterity Health; Dr. Joshua Klein, an assistant professor of Ob/Gyn at Mount Sinai’s medical school; and biosensor engineer Roel Mingels.
As for the founders, Rustamova was one of those wunderkind programmers. She won a Microsoft-sponsored competition when she was 16 that led her to help create a wearable posture-correcting device. After her software engineering degree, she spent several years at Palantir, until she itched to found a company and joined Entrepreneur First, a program that helps people find both their co-founders and an idea. That’s where she met Jia.
“It was founder love at first sight for both of us,” Rustamova recalled. Jia was a ballerina as a teen, rising to dance professionally before suffering an injury. She went back to school for a masters degree in industrial design, studying biomaterials and biosensors. She worked on medical devices at Philips for a few years before joining Entrepreneur First.
After founding Level Zero, the co-founders were also accepted into SOSV’s famed deep-tech/hardware HAX accelerator program. Among other benefits, HAX gives them access to lab equipment. They now have a prototype sensor that has hit a feasibility milestone by detecting progesterone in interstitial fluid at clinical levels, they say.
There’s still a long way to go before Level Zero has a device in the market, but its roadmap is fast. In addition to the device milestone, earlier this year the company secured clinical partnerships with IVF clinics in the U.S. They are readying their device for two clinical studies in 2025, and will start manufacturing engineering next year, as well. In 2026, the founders plan to conduct clinical trials and begin the FDA approval processes.
“We have spent an incredible amount of time speaking to expert clinicians, researchers in fertility, perimenopause, PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome] and others to make sure that the data we are providing is relevant,” Jia said. “We believe it is also why some of the leading names in fertility from Harvard, Mount Sinai, and Hims have joined our team and are continuously guiding us.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/nintendo-to-launch-10-animal-crossing-mobile-game-on-december-3/,Nintendo tries again on mobile with a $10 Animal Crossing game arriving in December | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-10-28,"It was a sad day when Nintendo announced that its free mobile game Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp would soon shut down. The app is ending its service on November 28; however, it’s also getting a revival. This time, though, it’ll be a paid game.
On December 3, Nintendo is launching a paid version of the app called Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete. For $10, users are getting a new rendition of the game, which includes most of the same gameplay mechanics and some new ones.
The launch of the new Animal Crossing game follows several other attempts by Nintendo to bring its most popular titles to mobile over the years, to mixed success. While Pokémon Go, a collab with Niantic, remains popular, other games featuring big IP, including Mario, didn’t meet expectations.
As Nintendo explains in a 12-minute video on YouTube, Pocket Camp Complete comes with several new features, such as the ability to walk around the island with your favorite villager and “Camper Cards,” which players can customize and trade with friends via QR codes.
Players are also getting a new mountain location, Whistle Pass, where friends can gather and gift items to each other. There, players can enjoy daily performances by K.K. Slider every night at 7 p.m.
Complete will also give players the ability to play fully offline, eliminating the need for a constant internet connection. However, since the app doesn’t need a connection, users can no longer play directly with friends online, so they can’t use the Market Box to buy or sell items.
Nintendo is also discontinuing two other features, including its premium currency, “Leaf Tickets” and Pocket Camp Club, the paid monthly subscription. Complete will switch to “Leaf Tokens,” which can be redeemed by exchanging Bells or completing tasks.
Plus, some of the features from Pocket Camp Club are making it to the new app, such as “Merry Memories,” which gives users designs and stickers for their planner and seasonal event rewards; “Happy Helper,” which lets players appoint a villager as a caretaker to collect items; and “Furniture & Fashion,” letting users save multiple layout designs and outfits.
Additionally, long-time players of the game can transfer their old data to the new version once it launches, letting them maintain their level and keep all their Bells and items. Some of their data can’t be preserved, however. For instance, Leaf Tickets won’t be transferred, so we recommend spending those before Nintendo takes down the app.
It’s important to note that Complete will only cost $10 until January 31, 2025. Nintendo plans to then increase the price to $20, which is very steep compared to other mobile games. Players can now preorder on the Google Play Store and App Store.
Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp launched in 2017 and quickly became a huge hit, achieving 15 million downloads in its first six days of availability. While it’s disappointing that Nintendo now charges for a game that was once free, we still look forward to trying out the new version. Even if it’s priced way higher than we hoped."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/spiralwaves-pulsing-plasma-towers-transform-carbon-dioxide-into-liquid-fuel/,SpiralWave’s pulsing plasma towers transform carbon dioxide into liquid fuel | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-10-28,"If there’s anything that came from one of the worlds that was promised to us in “Back to the Future” or “The Jetsons” or innumerable other sci-fi franchises, it’s what SpiralWave co-founder and CEO Abed Bukhari showed me on a video call. Purple-tinged waves of white plasma rhythmically rose and vanished within a metal-screened column, igniting in time with metronomic clicks coming from elsewhere in the chemistry kit.
This isn’t some space propulsion system, but a device that can capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or a smokestack and transform it into something useful. “You can see the plasma here in very quick pulses,” Bukhari told me. “With every pulse, it breaks down CO2.”
The plasma waves are ignited by three different pulses of microwaves, each with its own frequency that targets different molecular bonds, driving a cascade of chemical reactions.
“The first one breaks down CO2 into CO, the second one breaks down H2O into H and OH, and the third one is to join them into methanol,” Bukhari said. SpiralWave pitched its tech on the Startup Battlefield stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024.
Methanol is a simple hydrocarbon consisting of just a handful of atoms, but that simplicity offers flexibility. It can be burned directly in internal combustion engines, as some race cars do today, or it can be refined into more complex hydrocarbons like jet fuel. It can also be used to make chemicals used in a range of industries.
Depending on the concentration of carbon dioxide, SpiralWave’s process transforms between 75-90% of the system’s electrical energy into chemical energy stored in the form of methanol; atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are on the lower end of that range, and industrial flue gas is at the higher end. That compares favorably with other methods that make methanol from captured CO2, which are about 50% efficient.
Bukhari came to carbon removal in a roundabout way. His previous startup, KomraVision, made spectrometers, and to build the specialized components, he constructed some of his own semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Some of those tools used cold plasma, a form of energized matter commonly found in fluorescent lamps. “I was, at that time, very deep into cold plasma,” he said.
But with the climate crisis looming, “I needed to build something that can stall the biggest challenge we have on Earth these days, which is removing a huge quantity of CO2,” he said.
Bukhari had a cold-plasma hammer, and carbon pollution was looking a lot like a nail.
After building a small prototype to prove the concept, he met his co-founder, Adam Amad, then a student at Santa Clara University, and the two founded SpiralWave. Today, Amad is based in Silicon Valley, where he heads up business development, while Bukhari is in Austria, about 30 minutes from Munich, where he leads research and development. The company has raised $1 million from IndieBio, Amad said.
SpiralWave’s first prototypes range from the knee-high Nanobeam to Microbeam, which is about 2 meters or six-and-a-half feet. The devices can produce a metric ton of methanol using a stream of 90% carbon dioxide and 7,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. For more dilute streams, around 9%, it takes 8,500 kilowatt-hours, and for ambient air, it takes 10,000 kilowatt-hours, all of which compare favorably to other sources of e-methanol today.
The team has plans for larger devices, too, which it’s calling Megabeam and Gigabeam. The latter would be 100 meters tall and be able to remove one megaton of CO2 annually. “To fight climate change, we need to remove 10 gigatons of CO2 per year,” Bukhari said.
In the meantime, SpiralWave is focusing on replicating its smaller devices and placing them in shipping containers to be installed at customer sites. The duo are optimistic about their prospects: “With ten, 20-foot containers, we would have the largest e-methanol plant to date,” Amad said."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/wiz-ceo-explains-why-he-turned-down-a-23-billion-deal/,Wiz CEO explains why he turned down a $23 billion deal | TechCrunch,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-10-28,"Assaf Rappaport, the co-founder and CEO of cloud security startup Wiz, said that turning down a $23 billion offer from Google was “the toughest decision ever,” but justified it by saying the company can get even bigger and reach $100 billion because cloud security is the future.
“I think we did the right choice,” Rappaport said on Monday at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 conference.
“We believe it’s bigger, definitely bigger than endpoint, bigger than networks, so the opportunity to become a 100 plus billion dollar company is there. We believe that the company that is going to…own cloud security in the world is going to be a 100-plus billion dollar company,” he added. “I’m not sure it’s going to be Wiz, but if we do the right things, and we execute, I think it’s…in our hands.”
Even then, it was not an easy decision to make, as he had to think about Wiz’s investors, as well as its employees.
“I was super nervous,” he admitted. But it was he and his co-founders who made that call. “At a healthy company with a healthy relationship with investors, it’s always the founder’s decision.”
At the time Wiz had turned down the $23 billion offer from Alphabet, Google’s parent company, the four-year-old startup founded by former Israeli military officers had a private valuation of $12 billion.
The startup had raised $1 billion from investors backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, Index, and Thrive Capital. After that cash infusion, the company called itself “the world’s largest cybersecurity unicorn.”
“Saying no to such humbling offers is tough, but with our exceptional team, I feel confident in making that choice,” Rappaport said in an email to Wiz’s employees at the time, according to TechCrunch.
The CEO admitted that it also had other offers, though none as big as Google’s. Asked if Amazon was among them, Rappaport said only that “it’s not a unique position” for startups in Wiz’s position to be having other discussions.
Wiz has been one of the fastest-growing cybersecurity startups in recent years. This month, the company hit $500 million in annual recurring revenue, and hopes to double that to $1 billion in 2025, according to Roy Reznik, Wiz’s co-founder and VP of R&. Reznik argued that hitting that goal is a prerequisite for an IPO, which the company promised its employees after turning down Google’s offer.
When asked about Wiz’s M&A strategy, Rappaport said that even though the company made two acquisitions in the last year —  startups Gem and Rafft — in general, the company is risk-averse.
“Having the money doesn’t mean that you need to be active,” Rappaport said. “We’re a 1,500-people organization, so almost every acquisition is a tremendous culture that’s coming and might affect [Wiz’s culture,]” he added."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/forestguard-is-building-the-internet-of-trees-to-detect-fires-even-earlier/,ForestGuard is building the 'Internet of Trees' to detect fires even earlier | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-28,"Many startups have taken aim at the problem of early wildfire detection and prevention, but Turkey-based ForestGuard’s space-based system could give it an edge over competitors.
ForestGuard, which presented onstage today as part of the Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt, was founded by trained architects Muhammed Ali Örnek and Suat Batuhan Esirger, who witnessed the need for early detection firsthand after seeing the devastating effects of wildfires across Turkey in 2021. The pair realized that more could be done to detect wildfires at the earliest stages, and that many currently available systems that use thermal sensors or satellites are limited by the need for the hardware to be in line-of-sight to communicate.
The co-founders started thinking about a wearable device for trees that analyzes the air to detect fires. They started experimenting with development ports and different sensors, ultimately creating more than 50 different prototypes, many of which used LoRa, a low-power, long-range communication protocol. Their first test to see if the sensor could “read” the air? A barbecue in their garden.
The results were promising, and ForestGuard got its next big test after they installed some sensors in the south of Turkey in October 2022; those sensors sent out an alarm notification to ForestGuard just three weeks later. The ultimate culprit of the alarm was a person smoking a cigarette — not an ideal forest activity, but hardly a wildfire. The team realized they needed to make their sensor smarter.
The company ultimately settled on a sensor inside a small solar-powered box that reads air resistance values in milliseconds and can generate a “fingerprint” of what’s going on in the air around it, like if someone is smoking a cigarette or if there’s a car emitting exhaust nearby — or if there’s a wildfire. Puns shortly followed: The system has been called the “Internet of Trees” or the “WoodWideWeb.”
Many of the company’s sensors still use LoRa to communicate data, but after the devastating earthquake in Turkey last year, which destroyed terrestrial communication infrastructure, the company started developing sensors that use satellite connectivity. As Esirger put it in a recent interview, the company realized it had to become “disaster proof.”
ForestGuard’s newest tech is essentially a sensor-to-satellite RF communication system. The wide-spectrum sensors can measure a variety of data to generate that fingerprint, from gas levels to temperature to air pressure and more. The sensors are attached right to tree trunks, which transmit the data to EchoStar satellites in geostationary orbit. If emergency conditions are detected, the satellite pings ForestGuard, the customer, or the relevant authorities, to take action. Satellite connectivity is not any more expensive compared to LoRa or GSM, a cellular network protocol, because each device sends such small packets of data, the company explained.
For high-risk areas, which could have a manufacturing facility nearby, or are highly frequented by people, ForestGuard recommends one device per hectare; for low-risk areas, one device per 16, or even 32, hectare. The company’s two sensor models — the ones that use LoRa/GSM and the satellite-connected sensors — are presently monitoring more than 2 million square meters of forest in Turkey, with demonstrations currently happening in France, Australia, and England.
Beyond wildfires, the company pivoted at the start of this year to detect industrial fires, as well. ForestGuard’s current customers span forestry ministries, industrial facilities, resort hotels, and insurance companies. The company sells the devices for around $500, or leases them for $250 per device per year, with an annual subscription fee of $100.
ForestGuard is currently raising a $1 million seed round to expand its operations."

Speaking onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco, Wiz’s CEO and co-founder Assaf Rappaport, who recently turned down a $23 billion acquisition offer from Google, noted that his employees had been targeted by a deepfake attack just two weeks ago.
“Dozens of my employees got a voice message from me,” he explained. “The attack tried to get their credentials.”
The team caught on that something wasn’t right, however, because the hacker had tracked down audio of the CEO’s voice from a conference to create the deepfake.
Because he has public speaking anxiety, Rappaport’s voice from the event didn’t sound like the day-to-day voice that his employees were familiar with.
“That’s how they were able to say, ‘That doesn’t sound like Assaf.’”
The company could trace where the voice came from but wasn’t able to determine who was behind the attack.
“That’s why cyberattacks are so beneficial [for the attackers] … the risk of getting caught is very low,” Rappaport noted.
During the interview, the co-founder also spoke extensively about why Wiz turned down the Google deal, saying they believed the potential in the cloud security market was a $100 billion opportunity."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/apple-intelligence-is-coming-to-the-eu-in-april-2025/,Apple Intelligence is coming to the EU in April 2025 | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-10-28,"Remember when Apple blamed EU tech rules — and more specifically the Digital Markets Act — to justify the fact that Apple Intelligence wouldn’t be available in the European Union? Maybe that was just an attempt to turn EU users against their regulators as Apple Intelligence is coming to the EU in April 2025 along with local language support.
Apple just released iOS 18.1 on Monday with the first set of smart features coming to recent iPhone, iPad, and Mac models. However, when Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence at its developer conference back in June, the company said that it would be a slow rollout with new AI features limited to American English at first.
And that’s still the case today. While Apple Intelligence is technically out of beta, you have to set your iPhone or Mac to U.S. English. On the iPhone, Apple also checks if your Apple account is associated with a European address. If that’s the case, you can’t enable Apple Intelligence on your iPhone at all, even if you set your iPhone to U.S. English.
On the Mac, it’s a different story, as European users can try out Apple Intelligence features starting Monday. If you have a Mac with an M1 chip or later, you can change the language and enable Apple Intelligence right away. Observers assumed that’s because Apple has been designated as a gatekeeper under the DMA in relation to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store, and Safari; macOS wasn’t part of that list.
The company previously announced that support for more languages was on the way, starting with localized English support for other countries in December 2024. Apple plans to add another dozen languages throughout 2025, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.
However, Apple Intelligence will also be available on the iPhone in the EU in just a few months. “This April, Apple Intelligence features will start to roll out to iPhone and iPad users in the EU. This will include many of the core features of Apple Intelligence, including Writing Tools, Genmoji, a redesigned Siri with richer language understanding, ChatGPT integration, and more,” Apple wrote in a press release.
From this list, it turns out all Apple Intelligence features are coming to the EU, except … notification summaries? We’ve reached out to Apple for more details about what’s not coming to the EU and an Apple spokesperson sent us the following statement:
“We are thrilled that iPhone and iPad customers in the EU will have access to many of the core features of Apple Intelligence. Features like Writing Tools, Genmoji, a re-designed Siri with richer language understanding, ChatGPT integration, and many more capabilities will help users do even more with their devices. Since announcing Apple Intelligence, we have been working to find a path to deliver as many features as we can in the EU in a way that complies with the DMA while maintaining user privacy and security, and to determine what additional product engineering would be required to do so. We look forward to bringing Apple Intelligence features to users in the EU in future software updates.”
It sounds like it’s going to be hard to tell the differences. This leads us to this simple question: What was the issue with the DMA again?"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/apple-updates-imac-with-m4-chip-16gb-ram-starting-at-1299/,"Apple updates iMac with M4 Chip, 16GB RAM starting at $1,299 | TechCrunch",Brian Heater,2024-10-28,"Apple kicked off “Mac week” by unveiling a refresh to its perennial favorite all-in-one, the iMac. The big news here is the addition of the newish M4 chip, which the company says is 2x more powerful than the original M1 iMac. The new desktop notably arrives alongside the general availability of Apple Intelligence, which debuts as part of the macOS Sequoia 15.2 update.
The system is built around a 24-inch 4K display. Above this is a 12-megapixel webcam, built for the company’s Center Stage feature. The four ports on the rear of the device, meanwhile, are now a faster Thunderbolt 4. These are accompanied by a long-awaited refresh to the company’s keyboard, mouse, and trackpad accessories, finally ditching Lightning for the far more ubiquitous (and generally better) USB-C.
The new iMac is now available for preorder at $1,299. That will get you an 8-core CPU, an 8-core GPU, and 16GB of memory, upgradable to 32GB, 256GB, or 2TB. There’s also an option with a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, starting at $1,499. Other upgrades include the nano-texture display for reduced glare.
The M4 iMac starts shipping November 8. Color options include green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, and the classic silver."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/apple-intelligence-goes-live-with-ios-181-update/,Apple Intelligence goes live with iOS 18.1 update | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-28,"Apple on Monday confirmed the general availability of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1. The point update is most notable for its inclusion of the first batch of Apple Intelligence features, which the company announced at WWDC back in June.
However, only select Apple devices are equipped to run the new generative AI offering. This includes iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, all iPhone 16 models, iPads with an A17 Pro chip (including the new iPad mini) or M1 and later, or a Mac with an M1 or later.
After downloading the update, Apple will ask whether you’d like to opt in to the feature. Once you do, you’ll be added to a waitlist, a process that shouldn’t last longer than a couple of hours. It’s an unusual move for the company, owing to the remote server requirement for the LLM-based offering. Essentially Apple wants to get its back end ready for some big compute demands.
Not every function requires off-board processing, however. One piece that makes the system unique versus offerings like ChatGPT is its small model approach. The new Apple Intelligence features are trained on a selective dataset aimed at specific functions, rather than the massive, black box approach employed by others.
The first batch of Apple Intelligence features includes integrated writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for the redesigned Siri experience. iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 — which are currently available as developer betas — will bring another round of features.
These updates will bring an additional list of Apple Intelligence updates, including Genmoji, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence, Image Wand, and ChatGPT integration. Apple has yet to announce a time frame for GA on those updates."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/google-expands-ai-overviews-in-search-to-more-than-100-countries/,Google expands AI Overviews in Search to more than 100 countries | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-28,"Google Search’s AI Overviews, which display a snapshot of information at the top of the results page, are beginning to roll out in more than 100 countries and territories, the company announced on Monday.
Google first launched the feature in the United States in May before slowly rolling out to additional regions. Google says AI Overviews will now have more than 1 billion global users every month.
As part of the rollout, the company is making the feature available in more languages, including English, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish.
Since the launch of AI Overviews earlier this year, Google has been updating the feature to make it more useful. Earlier this month, Google launched in-line links that appear directly within the text of AI Overviews, which it says drives an increase in website traffic compared to the previous design that would simply pull text from sources.
Google is also using AI Overviews to expand its ads business, as the company recently revealed that ads in AI Overviews will now be displayed on relevant queries for mobile users in the United States.
AI Overviews had a rocky launch after the feature provided incorrect and sometimes dangerous information to users (the feature told users to put glue on pizza, for instance). Since then, Google has been fine-tuning the feature, and bringing a similar feature to its Shopping page."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/apples-magic-mouse-keyboard-and-trackpad-finally-get-usb-c/,"Apple’s Magic Mouse, Keyboard, and Trackpad finally get USB-C | TechCrunch",Brian Heater,2024-10-28,"Apple’s EU-mandated transition from Lightning to USB-C has already affected most of its hardware. There have been a few stragglers, however. Near the top of the list are its desktop accessories, the Magic Mouse, Magic Keyboard, and Magic Trackpad. On Monday, the company finally addressed the issue.
Along with an M4 refresh to the iMac, Apple has begun selling USB-C versions of its accessories. The prices remain the same as their Lightning predecessors at $199 for the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and numeric keypad, $149 for the Magic Trackpad, and $99 for the Magic Mouse.
All three are available in black and white options. Color-matched versions will also be shipping with the new iMac.
Unlike the new iMac, which won’t start shipping until November 8, all of the accessories can be purchased now and shipped immediately. Beyond the port swap, not much has changed about the devices, down to the oft-criticized decision to put the port on the bottom of the Magic Mouse.
The new iMac, accessory refresh, and arrival of Apple Intelligence are the first of what the company promises to be a week of announcements. Recent rumors include the arrival of a new Mac Mini measuring roughly the same size as Apple TV."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/generative-ai-could-cause-10-billion-iphones-worth-of-e-waste-per-year-by-2030/,Generative AI could cause 10 billion iPhones' worth of e-waste per year by 2030 | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-28,"The immense and quickly advancing computing requirements of AI models could lead to the industry discarding the e-waste equivalent of more than 10 billion iPhones per year by 2030, researchers project.
In a paper published in the journal Nature, researchers from Cambridge University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences take a shot at predicting just how much e-waste this growing industry could produce. Their aim is not to limit adoption of the technology, which they emphasize at the outset is promising and likely inevitable, but to better prepare the world for the tangible results of its rapid expansion.
Energy costs, they explain, have been looked at closely, as they are already in play.
However, the physical materials involved in their life cycle, and the waste stream of obsolete electronic equipment … have received less attention.
Our study aims not to precisely forecast the quantity of AI servers and their associated e-waste, but rather to provide initial gross estimates that highlight the potential scales of the forthcoming challenge, and to explore potential circular economy solutions.
It’s necessarily a hand-wavy business, projecting the secondary consequences of a notoriously fast-moving and unpredictable industry. But someone has to at least try, right? The point is not to get it right within a percentage, but within an order of magnitude. Are we talking about tens of thousands of tons of e-waste, hundreds of thousands, or millions? According to the researchers, it’s probably toward the high end of that range.
The researchers modeled a few scenarios of low, medium, and high growth, along with what kinds of computing resources would be needed to support those, and how long they would last. Their basic finding is that waste would increase by as much as a thousandfold over 2023:
“Our results indicate potential for rapid growth of e-waste from 2.6 thousand tons (kt) [per year] in 2023 to around 0.4–2.5 million tons (Mt) [per year] in 2030,” they write.
Now admittedly, using 2023 as a starting metric is maybe a little misleading: Because so much of the computing infrastructure was deployed over the last two years, the 2.6 kiloton figure doesn’t include them as waste. That lowers the starting figure considerably.
But in another sense, the metric is quite real and accurate: These are, after all, the approximate e-waste amounts before and after the generative AI boom. We will see a sharp uptick in the waste figures when this first large infrastructure reaches end of life over the next couple years.
There are various ways this could be mitigated, which the researchers outline (again, only in broad strokes). For instance, servers at the end of their lifespan could be downcycled rather than thrown away, and components like communications and power could be repurposed as well. Software and efficiency could also be improved, extending the effective life of a given chip generation or GPU type. Interestingly, they favor updating to the latest chips as soon as possible, because otherwise a company may have to, say, buy two slower GPUs to do the job of one high-end one — doubling (and perhaps accelerating) the resultant waste.
These mitigations could reduce the waste load anywhere from 16 to 86% — obviously quite a range. But it’s not so much a question of uncertainty on effectiveness as uncertainty on whether these measures will be adopted and how much. If every H100 gets a second life in a low-cost inference server at a university somewhere, that spreads out the reckoning a lot; if only one in 10 gets that treatment, not so much.
That means that achieving the low end of the waste versus the high one is, in their estimation, a choice — not an inevitability. You can read the full study here."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/stacklok-donates-its-minder-supply-chain-security-project-to-the-openssf/,Stacklok donates its Minder supply chain security project to the OpenSSF | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-10-28,"Stacklok, the open source software supply chain company founded by Kubernetes co-creator Craig McLuckie and Sigstore creator Luke Hinds, is donating Minder, one of its key projects, to the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF). Minder helps development teams set up a system of proactive checks and policies to minimize supply chain risks by enforcing best practices and, using Sigstore, ensures that all packages built by developers that use the project are cryptographically signed.
One of the key features of Minder is that it is extensible and, as McLuckie told me, the Stacklok team hopes that Minder can become a platform for other OpenSSF projects to build on and integrate with.
“Just as Kubernetes served as a point of integration for CNCF projects, Minder has the potential to serve as a platform for OpenSSF projects: a common integration framework for a rich ecosystem of open source security capabilities,” he told me. Minder, he hopes, will become something akin to being a community anchor that can form the basis for integrating a variety of security tools and make them easier to operationalize.
As McLuckie noted, most of the time when developers use an open source library in their projects, it’s akin to “an act of faith.”
“The thing that has been just sort of borderline shocking to me is this idea that open source, for all intents and purposes, is mostly just written by random people on the internet,” he said. “For me, it’s been this journey of how to increase the awareness of developers that are consuming open source, and helping communities that are building open source do it in a way that’s safer and more sustainable.”
While software supply chain wasn’t always top of mind for developers — and maybe not even most security professionals — SolarWinds and other recent attacks have definitely brought it to the forefront. McLuckie cited a recent example that Stacklok discovered. A hacking group affiliated with North Korea staged fake job interviews with developers who were all working in the Web 3.0/crypto space and had them install an NPM package as part of their programming tests. That package, of course, was infected with malware, and the attackers used that as a way to get into the supply chain.
“We see some of the most sophisticated stuff coming out of these nation-state actors,” McLuckie explained. “Their patterns of attack are different to anything we’ve seen historically. They do things like they’ll publish a package for four hours, and they know that most software composition analysis tools aren’t going to catch it in four hours. They’ll publish it and take it down.”
This means that tools like Minder have to intercept these attacks at the IDE, in the inner development loop. “By the time it hits the [pull request], it’s too late,” McLuckie said.
Minder is meant to be a system that can apply controls across the entire application life cycle, starting at the IDE and with the developer’s local package manager, all the way to the production environment. It can ingest signals from a variety of sources — and Stacklok, as a commercial entity, has built its own. But it can also start enforcing policies to, for example, ensure that developers start using quantum-resistant encryption libraries.
McLuckie pointed out that Google, his old employer, has also taken some interest in this project and is supporting it by, among other things, helping Stacklok drive some integrations with services like the open source vulnerability database. He also noted that while Stacklok has built integrations with GitHub, he’d love to see other communities build integrations with GitLab, BitBucket, and similar tools.”
Of course, for Stacklok as a company, the more successful Minder is as an open source project, the more likely it is that enterprises will come to Stacklok to look for support or subscribe to its hosted service. Yet McLuckie noted that given his experience in the open source ecosystem as a whole, it was important for him to not just make the code available under an open source license, but to ensure that the project will be community-driven.
“We want to make sure that we’re signaling unequivocally and irrevocably to the community that Minder is a community-centric platform that is not owned by us. It’s actually going to be owned by the community,” McLuckie said when I asked him about the motivation to bring Minder under a foundation’s umbrella. “We will continue to support it, but we obviously have a plan to operationalize and commercialize. And I think, having lived this journey with Kubernetes, I feel very positive about the outcomes we were able to generate on the back of Kubernetes. It became a half of the world’s workloads are running on Kubernetes, give or take, at this point. And so, you know, I would like to get to a point where half the world’s workloads are being secured by Minder — and I would feel very good about that.”"

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/how-apple-intelligence-is-changing-the-way-you-use-siri-on-your-iphone/,How Apple Intelligence will change how you use Siri on your iPhone | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-28,"Following years of talk around Apple’s lack of innovation when it comes to Siri, Apple has promised the launch of a smarter version of its digital assistant. Siri is getting new features and updates with the launch of iOS 18.1 thanks to the addition of Apple Intelligence, the company’s generative AI offering.
It’s worth noting that some of Siri’s upcoming major updates, such as an integration with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and onscreen awareness, aren’t yet available with iOS 18.1.
Here’s a look at what the introduction of Apple Intelligence allows you to do with the revamped digital assistant.
Apple is making it easier for people to communicate with Siri, as the assistant is now equipped to better understand natural language. Even if you stumble on your words when talking to Siri, the assistant will still be able to understand you. You can say, for instance, “Siri, set an alarm for, oh wait no, set a timer for 10 minutes. Actually, make that five.” Siri will understand what you’re asking.
Plus, you can ask Siri follow-up questions without having to repeat context. For example, if you ask Siri where your next family reunion is going to take place, it will respond with a location. You can then follow up by asking, “What will the weather be like there?” without having to mention the name of the location.
Up until now, you could only communicate with Siri via your voice. With Apple Intelligence, you can now type to Siri when you don’t want to speak out loud. You just need to double tap the button on your iPhone or iPad screen to ask Siri any question.
The option to type to Siri is handy when you’re in a quiet environment and can’t speak out loud. Or, perhaps you’re in a loud environment; typing to Siri can ensure your inquiry is understood clearly.
Siri now has more information about Apple’s products and services, so if you have a question about your Apple device, you can ask Siri for help. That includes how to use a feature for the first time on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
For instance, you can ask Siri how to schedule a text message to send later. Siri will then give you step-by-step instructions on how to do so. Otherwise you’d have to go into your settings and navigate to a help page if you needed more information about your device.
While the features listed above are launching Monday, Apple has promised the rollout of additional Apple Intelligence-powered features for Siri.
Siri will be able to tap into OpenAI’s ChatGPT to answer certain questions. For example, if you need recipe ideas to make a meal using some ingredients from your garden, you will be able to ask Siri, and Siri will automatically feed that info to ChatGPT to generate some options for you.
You won’t need a ChatGPT account, but you will need to grant permission for Siri to tap into the service.
Siri will also soon become aware of your personal context, which means it will be able to take actions that are unique to you. Siri will be able to use the information available on your device to find what you’re looking for.
For instance, if you can’t remember whether your friend Alice shared a recipe with you in a text or an email, you can ask Siri to “pull up the recipe that Alice sent a few days ago.” Or, if you quickly need to find your passport number when booking a flight, you can ask Siri to pull it from your email or your images to automatically enter it into a required field.
In addition, Siri will soon be able to understand what’s on your screen and take action based on what you’re currently looking at on your device. For instance, if your friend texts you a new address, you will be able to tell Siri to add the address to their contact card.
Siri will also be able to take action in and across apps. You will be able to ask Siri to enhance a photo for you in the Photos app and then ask the digital assistant to send it to a specific person in Messages. You won’t have to open the separate apps or complete the tasks, as Siri will be able to take action in both apps on its own."

After releasing Apple Intelligence features in developer beta and then public beta over the last few months, the company has released these features through iOS 18.1 to all users. While the initial beta version had restrictions on the region where Apple Intelligence was available, you can use the new AI features from anywhere — apart from EU and China — by setting the language as U.S. English.
Here is how you can start using Apple Intelligence features:
It will take a while for your iPhone to download the models related to Apple Intelligence and prepare your system for these features. You will get a notification when your iPhone is ready to use Apple Intelligence features.
At the moment, Apple Intelligence is only compatible with iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs that run on M1 chips."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/police-operation-claims-takedown-of-prolific-redline-and-meta-password-stealers/,Police operation claims takedown of prolific Redline and Meta password stealers | TechCrunch,Carly Page,2024-10-28,"A coalition of international law enforcement agencies say they have disrupted the operations of two prolific infostealers that stole the sensitive data of millions of people.
The Dutch National Police, who led the so-called “Operation Magnus” takedown, reports it gained “full access” to the servers used by the Redline and Meta infostealers.
Infostealers are a type of malware specifically designed to extract sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card data, search histories, and the contents of cryptocurrency wallets, from an infected system.
Redline is considered one of the most prolific strains of infostealer malware. Criminals have been using Redline, which has been active since 2020, to steal the sensitive data of hundreds of millions of people, according to a recent report. The malware has been attributed to a 2022 hack at Uber, the theft of login details from Worldcoin Orb operators, and the breach of a senior official at Israel’s National Cybersecurity Directorate.
Meta is a relatively new infostealer, though Operation Magnus notes: “We gained full access to all Redline and Meta servers. Did you know they were actually pretty much the same?”
In a video posted to the website on Monday, the agencies say they were able to access the usernames, passwords, IP addresses, timestamps and registration dates, along with the source code for both infostealers, and the Telegram bots used by the operators of the malware.
The agencies also teased a list of usernames belonging to “VIP” — or “very important to the police” — users of the Redline and Meta infostealers. It’s not yet clear if any arrests have been made as part of the operation, but the website claims that “legal actions are underway.”
Operation Magnus, which was supported by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.K.’s National Crime Agency, was announced on a newly created website outing the Redline and Meta operations. Simone van Wordragen, a spokesperson for the Dutch National Police, told TechCrunch that it will release more information about the takedown on Tuesday.
A similar takedown approach was taken during the recent operation targeting LockBit, which saw police take control of the ransomware gang’s dark web leak site to post details of the operation."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/u-k-man-who-used-ai-to-create-child-sexual-abuse-imagery-sentenced-to-18-years-in-prison/,UK man who used AI to create child sexual abuse imagery sentenced to 18 years in prison | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-28,"In what some are describing as a landmark case, a U.K. man who used AI to turn normal pictures of children into sexual abuse imagery has been sentenced to 18 years in jail.
Hugh Nelson, a 27-year-old from Bolton, used the app Daz 3D to create 3D “characters” from innocent photographs of kids. In some cases, people had commissioned the images, The Guardian reports, supplying photos of children with whom they had contact in real life.
Nelson sold the commissioned child sexual abuse images on online forums, making about £5,000 (~$6,494) over 18 months. He was caught after telling an undercover cop he charged £80 (~$103) to create a new character using supplied pictures.
Nelson was later found guilty of encouraging the rape of a child under 13, attempting to incite a boy under 16 to engage in a sexual act, distributing and making indecent images, and possessing prohibited images."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/what-are-ai-world-models-and-why-do-they-matter/,"What are AI 'world models,' and why do they matter? | TechCrunch",Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-28,"World models, also known as world simulators, are being touted by some as the next big thing in AI.
AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs has raised $230 million to build “large world models,” and DeepMind hired one of the creators of OpenAI’s video generator, Sora, to work on “world simulators.”
But what the heck are these things?
World models take inspiration from the mental models of the world that humans develop naturally. Our brains take the abstract representations from our senses and form them into more concrete understanding of the world around us, producing what we called “models” long before AI adopted the phrase. The predictions our brains make based on these models influence how we perceive the world.
A paper by AI researchers David Ha and Jürgen Schmidhuber gives the example of a baseball batter. Batters have milliseconds to decide how to swing their bat — shorter than the time it takes for visual signals to reach the brain. The reason they’re able to hit a 100-mile-per-hour fastball is because they can instinctively predict where the ball will go, Ha and Schmidhuber say.
“For professional players, this all happens subconsciously,” the research duo writes. “Their muscles reflexively swing the bat at the right time and location in line with their internal models’ predictions. They can quickly act on their predictions of the future without the need to consciously roll out possible future scenarios to form a plan.”
It’s these subconscious reasoning aspects of world models that some believe are prerequisites for human-level intelligence.
While the concept has been around for decades, world models have gained popularity recently in part because of their promising applications in the field of generative video.
Most, if not all, AI-generated videos veer into uncanny valley territory. Watch them long enough and something bizarre will happen, like limbs twisting and merging into each other.
While a generative model trained on years of video might accurately predict that a basketball bounces, it doesn’t actually have any idea why — just like language models don’t really understand the concepts behind words and phrases. But a world model with even a basic grasp of why the basketball bounces like it does will be better at showing it do that thing.
To enable this kind of insight, world models are trained on a range of data, including photos, audio, videos, and text, with the intent of creating internal representations of how the world works, and the ability to reason about the consequences of actions.
“A viewer expects that the world they’re watching behaves in a similar way to their reality,” Alex Mashrabov, Snap’s ex-AI chief of AI and the CEO of Higgsfield, which is building generative models for video, said. “If a feather drops with the weight of an anvil or a bowling ball shoots up hundreds of feet into the air, it’s jarring and takes the viewer out of the moment. With a strong world model, instead of a creator defining how each object is expected to move — which is tedious, cumbersome, and a poor use of time — the model will understand this.”
But better video generation is only the tip of the iceberg for world models. Researchers including Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun say the models could someday be used for sophisticated forecasting and planning in both the digital and physical realm.
In a talk earlier this year, LeCun described how a world model could help achieve a desired goal through reasoning. A model with a base representation of a “world” (e.g. a video of a dirty room), given an objective (a clean room), could come up with a sequence of actions to achieve that objective (deploy vacuums to sweep, clean the dishes, empty the trash) not because that’s a pattern it has observed but because it knows at a deeper level how to go from dirty to clean.
“We need machines that understand the world; [machines] that can remember things, that have intuition, have common sense — things that can reason and plan to the same level as humans,” LeCun said. “Despite what you might have heard from some of the most enthusiastic people, current AI systems are not capable of any of this.”
While LeCun estimates that we’re at least a decade away from the world models he envisions, today’s world models are showing promise as elementary physics simulators.
OpenAI notes in a blog that Sora, which it considers to be a world model, can simulate actions like a painter leaving brush strokes on a canvas. Models like Sora — and Sora itself — can also effectively simulate video games. For example, Sora can render a Minecraft-like UI and game world.
Future world models may be able to generate 3D worlds on demand for gaming, virtual photography, and more, World Labs co-founder Justin Johnson said on an episode of the a16z podcast.
“We already have the ability to create virtual, interactive worlds, but it costs hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars and a ton of development time,” Johnson said. “[World models] will let you not just get an image or a clip out, but a fully simulated, vibrant, and interactive 3D world.”
While the concept is enticing, many technical challenges stand in the way.
Training and running world models requires massive compute power even compared to the amount currently used by generative models. While some of the latest language models can run on a modern smartphone, Sora (arguably an early world model) would require thousands of GPUs to train and run, especially if their use becomes commonplace.
World models, like all AI models, also hallucinate — and internalize biases in their training data. A world model trained largely on videos of sunny weather in European cities might struggle to comprehend or depict Korean cities in snowy conditions, for example, or simply do so incorrectly.
A general lack of training data threatens to exacerbate these issues, says Mashrabov.
“We have seen models being really limited with generations of people of a certain type or race,” he said. “Training data for a world model must be broad enough to cover a diverse set of scenarios, but also highly specific to where the AI can deeply understand the nuances of those scenarios.”
In a recent post, AI startup Runway’s CEO, Cristóbal Valenzuela, says that data and engineering issues prevent today’s models from accurately capturing the behavior of a world’s inhabitants (e.g. humans and animals). “Models will need to generate consistent maps of the environment,” he said, “and the ability to navigate and interact in those environments.”
If all the major hurdles are overcome, though, Mashrabov believes that world models could “more robustly” bridge AI with the real world — leading to breakthroughs not only in virtual world generation but robotics and AI decision-making.
They could also spawn more capable robots.
Robots today are limited in what they can do because they don’t have an awareness of the world around them (or their own bodies). World models could give them that awareness, Mashrabov said — at least to a point.
“With an advanced world model, an AI could develop a personal understanding of whatever scenario it’s placed in,” he said, “and start to reason out possible solutions.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/remote-partners-with-carta-for-global-equity-grants-issuance-and-management/,Remote ropes in Carta to simplify equity grants for distributed teams | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-10-28,"A few months after acquiring equity management company Easop, Remote, an HR platform for managing geographically distributed teams, is doubling down on its focus on managing equity compensation with a new product, Remote Equity.
Remote already makes it easy for companies to work with talent all around the globe. Companies can hire workers based anywhere and treat them like local employees without having to open a local entity.
However, stock option plans have remained a hurdle for startups with distributed teams. Granting equity to international employees is a difficult proposition, as you need to account for tax withholdings and other local regulations.
Remote Equity essentially solves this by letting companies grant stock option plans to their international employees. These plans will be compliant with local rules in jurisdictions where Remote Equity is available, and companies won’t have to find lawyers local to their international employees to draft grant documentation.
For this product, Remote has roped in Carta as its first partner. Companies that use Carta to manage their cap table can draft and issue option grants in Carta and include international employees. Behind the scenes, Remote will generate the necessary legal documentation for additional jurisdictions, which will be available on Carta’s interface.
Equity data will be automatically synced between Carta and Remote Equity, letting managers see the entire compensation package for each employee from Remote’s interface — including stock option plans.
Valentin Haarscher, the co-founder and CEO of Easop, is now also the GM of Remote Equity.
Deel, one of Remote’s competitors in the global HR platform space, also integrates with Carta to sync equity events and automate global equity tax withholdings."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/read-ai-raises-50m-to-integrate-its-bot-with-slack-email-and-more/,Read AI raises $50M to capitalize on strong demand for its AI summary bot | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-28,"Now that we have so many startups offering AI bots that can do everything from listening to your meetings and transcribing them, to taking notes and surfacing insights, companies in the space are being forced to differentiate themselves by offering additional feature sets and integrations.
One such company, Read AI is trying to do just that by integrating its AI bot with email, Slack, and enterprise tools like HubSpot, Jira, and Confluence. And to accelerate its product development, the startup recently raised $50 million in a Series B funding round led by Smash Capital. Notably, the new round comes just six months after the startup raised a $21 million Series A.
Co-founder David Shim told TechCrunch that the company has seen strong customer growth since its Series A earlier this year — it has had more than 100,000 new accounts created across enterprises and individual users — and the company sought to leverage that growth.
“In less than six months, we’ve doubled our sign-ups, active users, and [monthly recurring revenue], surpassing even our most aggressive projections. We’re leveraging this momentum to raise now,” he said.
Shim didn’t disclose Read AI’s valuation, but he did say that its valuation saw a bump to match its growth.
Brad Twohig, co-founder and managing partner at Smash Capital, said that when investing, he often looks for companies that employ a product-led growth model, and Read AI fits that requirement well.
“I love finding companies in spaces that both cater to a large group of people and have an enterprise component at the same time,” he said.
Read AI started supporting integrations with email, messages, and meeting apps earlier this year, and the company is today releasing a Chrome extension that can display your schedules, meeting reports, a quick add-to-meeting option, and insights from meetings.
The extension can highlight key points within lengthy email threads, and can create email drafts that take into context previous emails, messages, and meetings. It also highlights quick notes from meetings or Slack messages about the same topics in email threads.
Email clients from providers like Shortwave and Superhuman also offer similar capabilities.
Read AI is offering the Chrome extension for free. Shim noted the new fundraise was another reason to develop and scale products like this and offer them without cost.
“Wherever you work, we’re pulling in that content, and we’re giving you summaries, we’re giving you recommendations. That’s a bigger opportunity, but there is a bigger cost center associated with it. We’re focusing on growing that market while maintaining the lead that we have on the meeting notes side,” Shim said.
Smash Capital’s Twohig feels services that transcribe meetings are becoming a commodity, but Read AI’s approach of deploying its AI bot everywhere can help it become a fine business.
“We ran into Read AI as an assistant showing up at meetings and taking notes. But when we sat down with David, we understood a broader vision and concept of having a co-pilot anywhere. This tool can follow you through day-to-day tasks, keep helpful records, and allow you to be a better teammate.”
Read AI currently has 40 employees and the company aims to expand its staff to 100 people by the end of the Q1 2025.
The Series B round also saw participation from existing investors Madrona and Goodwater Capital."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/we-finally-have-an-official-definition-for-open-source-ai/,We finally have an 'official' definition for open source AI | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-28,"There’s finally an “official” definition of open source AI.
The Open Source Initiative (OSI), a long-running institution aiming to define and “steward” all things open source, today released version 1.0 of its Open Source AI Definition (OSAID). The product of several years of collaboration with academia and industry, the OSAID is intended to offer a standard by which anyone can determine whether AI is open source — or not.
You might be wondering — as this reporter was — why consensus matters for a definition of open source AI. Well, a big motivation is getting policymakers and AI developers on the same page, said OSI EVP Stefano Maffulli.
“Regulators are already watching the space,” Maffulli told TechCrunch, noting that bodies like the European Commission have sought to give special recognition to open source. “We did explicit outreach to a diverse set of stakeholders and communities — not only the usual suspects in tech. We even tried to reach out to the organizations that most often talk to regulators in order to get their early feedback.”
To be considered open source under the OSAID, an AI model has to provide enough information about its design so that a person could “substantially” recreate it. The model must also disclose any pertinent details about its training data, including the provenance, how the data was processed, and how it can be obtained or licensed.
“An open source AI is an AI model that allows you to fully understand how it’s been built,” Maffulli said. “That means that you have access to all the components, such as the complete code used for training and data filtering.”
The OSAID also lays out usage rights developers should expect with open source AI, like the freedom to use the model for any purpose and modify it without having to ask anyone’s permission. “Most importantly, you should be able to build on top,” added Maffulli.
The OSI has no enforcement mechanisms to speak of. It can’t pressure developers to abide by or follow the OSAID. But it does intend to flag models described as “open source” but which fall short of the definition.
“Our hope is that when someone tries to abuse the term, the AI community will say, ‘We don’t recognize this as open source,’ and it gets corrected,” Maffulli said. Historically, this has had mixed results, but it isn’t entirely without effect.
Many startups and big tech companies, most prominently Meta, have employed the term “open source” to describe their AI model release strategies — but few meet the OSAID’s criteria. For example, Meta mandates that platforms with more than 700 million monthly active users request a special license to use its Llama models.
Maffulli has been openly critical of Meta’s decision to call its models “open source.” After discussions with the OSI, Google and Microsoft agreed to drop their use of the term for models that aren’t fully open, but Meta hasn’t, he said.
Stability AI, which has long advertised its models as “open,” requires that businesses making more than $1 million in revenue obtain an enterprise license. And French AI upstart Mistral’s license bars the use of certain models and outputs for commercial ventures.
A study last August by researchers at the Signal Foundation, the nonprofit AI Now Institute, and Carnegie Mellon found that many “open source” models are basically open source in name only. The data required to train the models is kept secret, the compute power needed to run them is beyond the reach of many developers, and the techniques to fine-tune them are intimidatingly complex.
Instead of democratizing AI, these “open source” projects tend to entrench and expand centralized power, the study’s authors concluded. Indeed, Meta’s Llama models have racked up hundreds of millions of downloads, and Stability claims that its models power up to 80% of all AI-generated imagery.
Meta disagrees with this assessment, unsurprisingly — and takes issue with the OSAID as written (despite having participated in the drafting process). A spokesperson defended the company’s license for Llama, arguing that the terms — and accompanying acceptable use policy — act as guardrails against harmful deployments.
Meta also said it’s taking a “cautious approach” to sharing model details, including details about training data, as regulations like California’s training transparency law evolve.
“We agree with our partner the OSI on many things, but we, like others across the industry, disagree with their new definition,” the spokesperson said. “There is no single open source AI definition, and defining it is a challenge because previous open source definitions do not encompass the complexities of today’s rapidly advancing AI models. We make Llama free and openly available, and our license and acceptable use Policy help keep people safe by having some restrictions in place. We will continue working with the OSI and other industry groups to make AI more accessible and free responsibly, regardless of technical definitions.”
The spokesperson pointed to other efforts to codify “open source” AI, like the Linux Foundation’s suggested definitions, the Free Software Foundation’s criteria for “free machine learning applications,” and proposals from other AI researchers.
Meta, incongruously enough, is one of the companies funding the OSI’s work — along with tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Salesforce. (The OSI recently secured a grant from the nonprofit Sloan Foundation to lessen its reliance on tech industry backers.)
Meta’s reluctance to reveal training data likely has to do with the way its — and most — AI models are developed.
AI companies scrape vast amounts of images, audio, videos, and more from social media and websites, and train their models on this “publicly available data,” as it is usually called. In today’s cut-throat market, a company’s methods of assembling and refining datasets are considered a competitive advantage, and companies cite this as one of the main reasons for their nondisclosure.
But training data details can also paint a legal target on developers’ backs. Authors and publishers claim that Meta used copyrighted books for training. Artists have filed suits against Stability for scraping their work and reproducing it without credit, an act they compare to theft.
It’s not tough to see how the OSAID could be problematic for companies trying to resolve lawsuits favorably, especially if plaintiffs and judges find the definition compelling enough to use in court.
Some suggest the definition doesn’t go far enough, for instance in how it deals with proprietary training data licensure. Luca Antiga, the CTO of Lightning AI, points out that a model may meet all of the OSAID’s requirements despite the fact that the data used to train it isn’t freely available. Is it “open” if you have to pay thousands to inspect the private stores of images that a model’s creators paid to license?
“To be of practical value, especially for businesses, any definition of open source AI needs to give reasonable confidence that what is being licensed can be licensed for the way that an organization is using it,” Antiga told TechCrunch. “By neglecting to deal with licensing of training data, the OSI is leaving a gaping hole that will make terms less effective in determining whether OSI-licensed AI models can be adopted in real-world situations.”
In version 1.0 of the OSAID, the OSI also doesn’t address copyright as it pertains to AI models, and whether granting a copyright license would be enough to ensure a model satisfies the open source definition. It’s not clear yet whether models — or components of models — can be copyrighted under current IP law. But if the courts decide they can be, the OSI suggests new “legal instruments” may be needed to properly open source IP-protected models.
Maffulli agreed that the definition will need updates — perhaps sooner than later. To this end, the OSI has established a committee that’ll be responsible for monitoring how the OSAID is applied, and proposing amendments for future versions.
“This isn’t the work of lone geniuses in a basement,” he said. “It’s work that’s being done in the open with wide stakeholders and different interest groups.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/xai-adds-image-understanding-capabilities-to-grok/,Elon Musk's xAI adds image understanding capabilities to Grok | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-28,"Elon Musk-owned xAI has added image-understanding capabilities to its Grok AI model. This means that paid users on his social platform X, who have access to the AI chatbot, can upload an image and ask the AI questions about it.
An xAI employee and the official @grok handle posted to X about the update on Monday.
In a separate post, Musk said that Grok can even explain the meaning of a joke using the new image understanding feature. He added that the functionality is in the early stages — suggesting it will “rapidly improve.”
In August, Musk’s AI company released the Grok-2 model, an enhanced version of the chatbot that included image generation capabilities using the FLUX.1 model by Black Forest Labs. As with earlier releases, Grok-2 was made available for developers or premium (paying) X users.
At that time, xAI said a future release would add multimodal understanding to Grok on X and to the model it offers via developer API.
Grok may soon also understand documents, per a Musk reply to a user who criticized the model for not being able to handle certain file formats (such as PDFs). “Not for long,” Musk responded, claiming: “We are getting done in months what took everyone else years.”
The social network has been trying to add more features to both the AI chatbot and paid user tiers on X to make the offering more attractive. Earlier this month, X rolled out a new tool called Radar for Premium+ subscribers to observe real-time trends and provide insights into conversations."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/filigran-secures-35-million-for-its-cybersecurity-threat-management-suite/,Filigran secures $35M for its cybersecurity threat management suite | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-10-28,"Paris-based startup Filigran is fast becoming the next cybersecurity rocket ship to track: The company just raised a $35 million Series B round, only a few months after it raised $16 million in a Series A round.
Filigran’s main product is OpenCTI, an open source threat intelligence platform that lets companies or public sector organizations import threat data from multiple sources and enrich that data set with intel from providers such as CrowdStrike, SentinelOne or Sekoia.
The open source version of OpenCTI has attracted contributions from 4,300 cybersecurity professionals and been downloaded millions of times. The European Commission, the FBI and the New York City Cyber Command all use OpenCTI. The company also offers an enterprise edition that can be used as a software-as-a-service product or hosted on premises, and its clients include Airbus, Marriott, Thales, Hermès, Rivian and Bouygues Telecom.
Filigran has been capitalizing on that success to add other products and build a full-fledged cybersecurity suite dubbed eXtended Threat Management (XTM) suite.
Another product is OpenBAS, a breach and attack simulation platform. You can use OpenCTI and OpenBAS separately, but using them supposedly together provides a better overview of the potential risks.
Filigran is taking advantage of the fact that it’s always easier to launch a second product when your first product is popular. The startup is already working on its third product.
“By 2026, our goal is to offer a comprehensive suite of three complementary products, providing end-to-end solutions in threat management that directly address the complex cybersecurity challenges faced by modern organizations,” co-founder and CEO Samuel Hassine told TechCrunch.
Interestingly, Filigran is also drawing inspiration from GitHub and Hugging Face, the main hubs for open source software development and artificial intelligence development, respectively. Filigran wants to launch XTM Hub — “a collaborative platform designed to empower the cybersecurity community” — by the end of the year, Hassine said.
“The hub will serve as a central forum where users can access resources, share tradecraft and connect with others in the Filigran ecosystem,” he added.
Insight Partners is leading the Series B round, with existing investors Accel and Moonfire investing once again. In addition to product development, a portion of this funding round will be used to expand Filigran’s presence in other regions. The company operates in France, the U.S., and Australia, and plans to expand to Germany, Japan, and Singapore."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/india-fintech-slice-now-bank/,Indian fintech Slice seals bank merger | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-10-28,"Indian fintech startup Slice said it has completed its merger with North East Small Finance Bank, marking a rare instance of a startup successfully entering India’s tightly regulated banking sector.
The merger, first proposed last year, transforms the Bengaluru-based startup into a banking entity, following months of regulatory scrutiny.
Slice, which gained prominence by issuing credit card-like products, will maintain its existing digital payment and lending services, and expand into traditional banking with offerings like savings accounts and investment products, the startup said in an email sent to customers on Sunday.
Banking licenses have proved elusive in India, with the central bank rejecting most applications in recent years. The Reserve Bank of India’s wariness stems from its experience with failed banks in the 1990s and governance lapses at Yes Bank and PMC Bank in the past decade.
India has produced dozens of fintech unicorns, but most companies must partner with traditional banks if they want to offer banking services — leaving them vulnerable to regulatory changes and partner banks’ shifting priorities. This may be why so many startups and venture firms are scrambling for a banking play in the country.
Jupiter, another fintech, in September was said to be in advanced talks to acquire a stake in the Indian subsidiary of SBM Bank.
Slice’s merger with North East Small Finance Bank gives the startup access to capital at lower cost and direct control over its lending operations. Slice, which counts Tiger Global, Insight Partners, and Blume Ventures among its backers, was valued at around $1.5 billion at the time of the merger announcement last year.
“For over a year, the teams at Slice and NESFB have worked tirelessly to make this merger a reality,” said Rajan Bajaj, founder and CEO of Slice, in a statement. “Today, we’re thrilled to be at the starting line of building India’s most loved bank,” he added.
North East Small Finance Bank, established in 2016 as a subsidiary of RGVN Microfinance, focuses on serving customers in India’s northeastern region, and counts Pi Ventures, Bajaj Group, and SIDBI Venture Capital among its investors."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/instagram-is-lowering-video-quality-for-unpopular-videos/,Instagram is lowering video quality for unpopular videos | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-10-27,"The popularity of an Instagram video can affect its actual video quality: According to Adam Mosseri (the Meta executive who leads Instagram and Threads), videos that are more popular get shown in higher quality, while less popular videos get shown in lower quality.
In a video (via The Verge), Mosseri said Instagram tries to show “the highest-quality video that we can,” but he said, “if something isn’t watched for a long time — because the vast majority of views are in the beginning — we will move to a lower quality video.”
This isn’t totally new information; Meta wrote last year about using different encoding configurations for different videos depending on their popularity. But after someone shared Mosseri’s video on Threads, many users had questions and criticisms, with one going as far as to describe the company’s approach as “truly insane.”
The discussion prompted Mosseri to offer more detail. For one thing, he clarified that these decisions are happening on an “aggregate level, not an individual level,” so it’s not a situation where individual viewer engagement will affect the quality of the video that’s played for them.
“We bias to higher quality (more CPU intensive encoding and more expensive storage for bigger files) for creators who drive more views,” Mosseri added. “It’s not a binary [threshold], but rather a sliding scale.”
A number of users also suggested that this approach creates a system that privileges popular creators over smaller ones — popular creators get to post in the highest quality, which reinforces their popularity, while smaller creators can’t break through.
Mosseri said it’s “the right concern,” but he claimed, “In practice it doesn’t seem to matter much, as the quality shift isn’t huge and [whether] or not people interact with videos is way more based on the content of the video than the quality.” Quality, he said, turns out “to be much more important to the original creator.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/founders-and-vcs-back-a-pan-european-c-corp-but-an-eu-inc-has-a-rocky-road-ahead/,"Founders and VCs back a Pan-European C corp, but an ‘EU Inc’ has a rocky road ahead | TechCrunch","Mike Butcher, Anna Heim",2024-10-27,"It’s become a common refrain in political discourse: Europe needs to take radical action to remain competitive. On the long list of potential reforms, one that’s gaining particular traction is a new, EU-wide corporate status for innovative companies.
Known (somewhat obscurely) as the “28th regime,” the innovation is being billed as Europe’s answer to a Delaware C corp and would add to what already exists in the EU’s 27 member states. It is now supported by an entrepreneur and VC-supported grassroots movement that also brought along the much more palatable name of EU Inc — and some unexpected momentum. Launched on October 14, the EU Inc petition has already attracted some 11,000 signatures.
The U.S. connotation of the term “Inc” is not a coincidence; while startups and VCs all over the world are now familiar with the Delaware C corp, Europe still has a gap in that regard. An existing formulation dubbed “Societas Europaea” (Europe does love its Latin) was aimed at larger companies but has failed to gain traction or any widespread usage. As a result, expanding across the continent is still a demanding process that needs to be conducted country by country, adding to the reasons why Pan-European tech champions are still a rarity.
Seeing as a new company vehicle would likely facilitate cross-border investments into European startups, the EU Inc petition has been endorsed by entire VC firms and a who’s who of startup founders and investors, such as Niklas Zennström and Patrick Collison.
One of the petition’s four leaders, entrepreneur-turned-investor Andreas Klinger, is reminded of how all his first companies ended up being U.K. Ltds because at the time, the ability to distribute options was so torturous in places like France or Germany. He says the main issues for startups in Europe are “very fundamental structural problems.” He and the EU Inc backers have effectively marched on the EU Commission. “A, the startup community needs this and wants this; B, it has urgency; and C, make sure it’s implemented the right way,” he told TechCrunch in an interview.
In a recently added roadmap, the EU Inc movement set out the goal to submit its final petition on December 1, with hopes that the new college of EU commissioners taking office then will make it part of its agenda for the next five years.
It will certainly help that the call has tacit support from inside the house, or rather, the European Commission, with recently commissioned reports from Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi both vowing for a 28th regime, not to mention President Ursula von der Leyen herself. But with so many problems and sectors competing for attention, the campaign will have to be careful not to lose momentum. Hence the campaign’s call for the European startup ecosystem to unite around the initiative.
Rallying does seem well underway, in no small part by way of French startup and VC lobby organization France Digitale. Its working document calling for a 28th regime was already in the works before the EU Inc campaign took off and has now been endorsed by several other startup associations across Europe.
This kind of national support could be key for success, but perhaps even more so, given the level of detail included in the proposal that France Digitale penned and amended after conversations with peers. For instance, co-author Antoine Latran pointed out to TechCrunch, it calls for a “regulation” rather than a directive to avoid unwanted differences in national transpositions. This is one of the lessons learned from the Societas Europaea, a cross-border legal form that France Digitale says “has proven to be virtually unworkable for startups, SMEs, and high-growth companies.”
EU Inc and its backers are certainly keen to draw from past experiences, including the Not Optional campaign that contributed to improving stock option policies in 11 European countries. Index Ventures partner Martin Mignot told TechCrunch that while he and his team are enthusiasts for EU Inc, leading this previous campaign has shown it’s a long road: “With all things lobbying, you have to be willing to go the distance and keep on applying pressure.”
And some observers are concerned the aspiration for the European equivalent of a Delaware company structure will be dragged down by red tape and nation-states.
“When it comes to the EU Inc, I have my serious doubts that the countries will be able to agree on a common standard which is simple to understand and most importantly not too bureaucratic,” specialist lawyer Stefan Jeitler told TechCrunch. An Austria-based partner at law firm E+H Rechtsanwälte, he gave the example of the very different capital maintenance regimes across the EU countries.
“Applying the (strict) Austrian or German capital maintenance regime to each and every EU Inc,” Jeitler wrote, “would make it rather unattractive in countries with a ‘not so strict’ regime.” France Digitale addressed this specific point in its non-paper, calling for a “1€ company.”
Still, there will be many other similar hurdles along the way. “The devil is in the details, and that’s going to be where we’re going to be very, very watchful,” Mignot said.
Brexit is another can of worms, but Mignot is hopeful that the U.K. could still follow suit: “They could say, ‘Look, if you are an EU Inc, it works for us too.’” The EU Inc shares a similar outlook in its FAQ, noting that while “starting EU centric solutions has the biggest leverage,” its focus is “Europe, not the EU.”
Whether it’s Europe or the EU, there’s growing consensus that the region needs to take action not to stay behind. Says deep tech investor Michael Jackson: “Europe is in a much more competitive landscape than it was 30, 40, years ago, right? China is the big panda in the room. You’ve got other parts of the world that are starting to really grow their economies and focus on tech and innovation. Europe can’t be on the sidelines.”
With all that said, it’s hard to contain the enthusiasm of EU Inc campaigners like Klinger: “The crazy thing about all of this is it’s actually going to happen. … This is us as an industry saying very clearly on one topic, very focused, not like a list of 20 requests, but like one thing, ‘This is important.’ Plus it can become a platform for other important things like stock options, exits, all this kind of stuff that’s very complex in Europe.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/the-next-mac-mini-might-be-nearly-as-small-as-an-apple-tv/,The next Mac mini might be nearly as small as an Apple TV | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-10-27,"The Mac mini will be getting an upgrade this week, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.
The mini is Apple’s desktop computer (really just a small gray box) positioned between the consumer iMac and the company’s professional-grade desktops.
The new mini is reportedly getting smaller — nearly the size of an Apple TV set-top box. It will include two ports in the front and (in some models) three in the back. For the first time, it will support the ray tracing graphics technique. Apparently, Gurman’s sources claim this will be “the most impressive Mac yet to use Apple’s in-house silicon.”
The two new Mac mini models will reportedly be part of a slew of new Apple devices announced this week. The lineup will also include a 24-inch iMac, a 16-inch MacBook Pro, and two different configurations of the 14-inch MacBook Pro, all using Apple’s M4 chip.
One additional tidbit: Gurman also reports that Apple’s rumored smart home display will be about the size of two iPhones side by side, with a small base (similar to the iMac G4) that also includes speakers."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/meta-releases-an-open-version-of-googles-podcast-generator/,Meta releases an 'open' version of Google's podcast generator | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-27,"Meta has released an “open” implementation of the viral generate-a-podcast feature in Google’s NotebookLM.
Called NotebookLlama, the project uses Meta’s own Llama models for much of the processing, unsurprisingly. Like NotebookLM, it can generate back-and-forth, podcast-style digests of text files uploaded to it.
NotebookLlama first creates a transcript from a file — for example, a PDF of a news article or blog post. Then it adds “more dramatization” and interruptions before feeding the transcript to open text-to-speech models.
The results don’t sound nearly as good as NotebookLM. In the NotebookLlama samples I’ve listened to, the voices have a very obvious robotic quality to them and tend to talk over each other at odd points.
But the Meta researchers behind the project say that the quality could be improved with stronger models.
“The [text-to-speech] model is the limitation of how natural this will sound,” they wrote on NotebookLlama’s GitHub page. “[Also,] another approach of writing the podcast would be having two agents debate the topic of interest and write the podcast outline. Right now we use a single model to write the podcast outline.”
NotebookLlama isn’t the first attempt to replicate NotebookLM’s podcast feature. Some projects have had more success than others. But none — not even NotebookLM itself — have managed to solve the hallucination problem that dogs all AI. That is, AI-generated podcasts are bound to contain some made-up stuff.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/merlin-solar-bets-twisty-panels-will-help-it-land-on-rooftops-everywhere/,Merlin Solar bets twisty panels will help it land on rooftops everywhere | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-10-27,"Solar panels are just about everywhere. There’s a good chance one of your neighbors has them on their roof, as does the big box store down the street. As you drive there, you might see a field of them posted up alongside the road. With that kind of ubiquity, you’d be forgiven if you thought there wasn’t room for improvement.
Venkatesan Murali would like to prove you wrong.
Murali, founder and CTO of Merlin Solar, has been working a new angle on solar for nearly a decade. He founded the company in 2016, after Solyndra’s spectacular implosion in 2011 and as Chinese manufacturers were driving panels down a vertiginous cost curve. But Murali remained fixated, though he did take a lesson from the debacle.
“Don’t scare the heck out of people with something new,” he told TechCrunch. “No new molecules, no new physics.”
Instead, Merlin Solar turned to an existing and widely used solar technology — monocrystalline silicon. Solar cells made with the stuff are inexpensive but fragile; to prevent fractures, companies usually sandwich monocrystalline silicon within two panels of glass bordered by a metal frame. That makes panels heavy, and it limits where they can be installed.
Murali wanted flexible solar panels, but using monocrystalline silicon posed a challenge. “Everything crystalline will eventually crack,” Murali said. “Can we make sure every electron will find its way, even if a bullet went through?”
To answer that, the company changed the way cells are connected within a panel. Merlin beefed up the number of connections front and back and, between cells, made the interconnects springy so they could bounce back after being bent.
“All of a sudden, we had a product that was not only resistant to cracking, but electrically resilient to cracking,” he said.
Merlin’s panels are significantly lighter than a typical glass panel, and their flexible nature changes how and where they can be installed. The panels come with an adhesive on the pack, so they can be attached to surfaces just like a child’s sticker. The bendy structure can follow the contours of different surfaces, allowing them to mount flush atop the roof of an Airstream trailer, for example.
Merlin says its panels can cope with partial shading better than traditional panels. In a traditional panel, once something like a leaf shades a corner of the cell, power production drops off dramatically. Merlin’s web of connections allows more power to route around the shaded cell.
The added flexibility, light weight, and ability to handle shading has made Merlin’s panels a favorite among recreational vehicles owners. The company has also sold panels to companies like Perdue, Daimler, and Ryder for use on their trucks, allowing them to reduce idling or the use of fossil fuels to power onboard refrigerators.
Merlin’s tweaks mean its products cost more than typical solar panels, which has forced it to get creative with who it sells to. “We go into spaces where we are not competing singularly on cost,” Murali said. “When I am minimizing idling of a truck, I’m going up against dirty and expensive energy produced by burning diesel. And so when I go up against that, my ROI is typically within a year and a half.”
Beyond RV owners and shippers, the company is also eyeing the rooftop solar business, where a significant share of solar panels are installed. To scale up, the company recently raised a $31 million Series B led by Fifth Wall with participation from Saint-Gobain and Ayala.
Merlin hopes that Saint-Gobain, one of the largest roofing materials companies, will become one of the startup’s largest customers, with its panels finding their way into Saint-Gobain’s solar shingles, Merlin COO Laura Allen said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/arcade-a-new-ai-product-creation-platform-designed-this-necklace/,"Arcade, a new AI product creation platform, designed this necklace | TechCrunch",Lauren Forristal,2024-10-27,"Mariam Naficy, the founder of cosmetics retailer Eve and design marketplace Minted, has a long history of supporting independent artists and helping them sell their products. Her latest venture, Arcade AI, is a new type of marketplace that puts creative control directly into the hands of users.
The generative AI platform, which launched its beta in September, allows customers — referred to as “Dreamers” — to input their ideas into a generator that then produces a variety of jewelry design options. They can also upload images.
Once a “Dream” is selected, it’s assigned to one of Arcade’s artisans, who brings the digital concepts to life as tangible pieces of jewelry, including bracelets, charms, earrings, necklaces, rings, and more. There are a number of materials to choose from, including gold, brass, silver, and a variety of gemstones, including diamonds, garnet, ruby, and more.
I tested the new generator myself, which leverages a mix of third-party models, such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. After entering my personal preferences, particularly my love for opals, the AI tool generated a delicate, gold floral necklace for me (featured in the image above).
I then placed the order with Studio Maisette, one of the design studios on the platform, and a few days later, I received a video of the finished product for approval. The entire process, from order placement to product delivery, took around two weeks.
While the necklace might seem basic at first glance, I think it perfectly captures my aesthetic. Bonus points for the trio of opals, which are of good quality, according to my gemologist friend.
Not all the results generated were up to standard, however, and I ran into some hurdles along the way. For example, the AI generator had a hard time adding multiple charms to one necklace. It also failed to create complex objects like a 20-sided die.
“To make sure that everything is manufacturable, we actually have to constrain the models a little bit to what the makers are giving us in terms of data or what they can make,” Naficy told me.
Fortunately, there’s an editing tool where you can add, erase, or adjust certain elements to truly bring your vision to life. Still, it didn’t always turn out as I envisioned.
Naficy plans to improve the “magic editor,” adding things like image prompt (IP) adapters, which are small models that allow pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to create images based on image prompts. Another idea in the works is to let users choose a part of the image to modify. Or drag a part of the image and move it elsewhere.
Designing custom jewelry on Arcade can be quite expensive, potentially costing $1,000 or more, depending on the complexity of the design. However, if you prefer a simpler piece, you can expect to spend around $100. Shipping ranges from $10 to $30. This is in line with what custom-designed jewelry usually costs.
For reference, the piece I designed was priced at $186 plus $10 in shipping.
The cost depends on the material used, the size of the object, and other factors like the length of a necklace chain or any additional requests you want to add in the comments section to the manufacturer. Makers set their prices and have to accept the design and agree with the price before agreeing to make it. They can also reject a design if they think it’s too complicated to make.
Even if users can’t afford to purchase their creations on the website, Naficy said they can simply enjoy the process of creating and adding their designs to the collection of “Dream Boards” featured on their profile.
“We just want this to be magical and fun, and we’re just going to keep working on these experiences until it’s more magical and very fun. But there is this part of me that just wants people to be able to create for fun and share their creations with other people. They don’t actually have to only buy to experience the site,” she said.
Notably, “Dreamers” can profit from their designs, earning a 2.5% commission on sales. To become a seller, users must have 100 followers and have either sold three items or sold $500 worth of products. In the coming weeks, they’ll be able to set their own price point.
Using an AI generator to allow customers to take control of design could be controversial among jewelry designers for several reasons. Designers may worry that their unique creations could be replicated or used without permission, which could infringe on their intellectual property rights. Additionally, some might fear that automating the design process could result in fewer opportunities for human designers, jeopardizing their livelihoods.
However, Naficy claims the artisans featured on Arcade feel differently.
“They were very receptive. I was not expecting that. … They saw it as a way to increase business, you know, like, ‘This is great because now I can talk to consumers and understand what they want.’”
And, according to Naficy, the AI model is trained never to copy a design exactly as it is shown in the uploaded image.
“We can block certain words from being used in the prompt layer. Also, in our image functionality, we can dial up how strongly the AI is allowed to deviate from the source image,” she explained.
“I spent 15 years running Minted, where people would copy our artists all the time, and I could see the pain that it caused people. I was very artist-empathetic because we were constantly issuing takedown notices for them on our site and trying to protect the artists and the art. So what we’re doing, I think gives us actually more control than most marketplaces,” Naficy added.
Arcade is considering expanding to other categories in the future, possibly adding accessories, apparel, leather goods, and more. This would have Arcade directly competing with Off/Script, another product creation platform that emerged last year to help artists fund their AI-designed items, spanning from clothing and accessories to home decor and furniture.
In terms of features, Naficy wants to add more social features in the coming months. This includes the ability for sellers to thank users who buy their designs and options for community members to chat with each other. Arcade may also launch competitions where winners can earn free jewelry if their design gets the most votes.
Another long-term goal is to partner with major brands, allowing users to purchase products from well-known retailers directly through the platform.
Arcade has received $17 million in total funding from Ashton Kutcher (Sound Ventures), Offline Ventures, and Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn co-founder). Other notable investors include Colin Kaepernick, Lumi founder and former NFL quarterback; David Luan, CEO of Adept AI Labs and former vice president of engineering at OpenAI; and supermodel and entrepreneur Karlie Kloss, among others."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/jon-mcneills-insights-on-teslas-robotaxi-and-why-ev-startups-fail/,Jon McNeill’s insights on Tesla’s robotaxi and why EV startups fail | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-10-27,"Jon McNeill — a former Tesla and Lyft executive and current CEO at DVx Ventures — spread the word last week at the World Business Forum on what he calls the “Tesla innovation method” of radical simplification.
After his presentation, we sat down to chat about Tesla’s automation goals, its new robotaxi, and why building electric vehicles is a tough business.
Tesla rolled out Autopilot, its advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that can perform limited automated driving tasks, back in 2015. McNeill said automation has been a major initiative for Tesla for almost a decade.
“It was a topic of conversation every week, if not every day,” he told TechCrunch.
That’s partly why McNeill, along with many others, was surprised by the nothing burger that was Tesla’s much-anticipated robotaxi reveal earlier this month.
“Oftentimes, Elon has got something up his sleeve where he’ll not reveal it until one of those product events. And so I was really wondering, what’s up his sleeve? What does he have? Because Waymo and Cruise are already at Level 4. Tesla’s at Level 2. He’s got to have some major breakthroughs he’s going to talk about to take it from Level 2 to Level 4.”
(The SAE defines Level 2 automation as ADAS that can do things like brake support and lane centering, but require a human to constantly drive and supervise. Level 4 means the car can drive itself without a human under certain conditions.)
But in the end, Musk only revealed 20 robotaxi prototypes. “That’s not to say they don’t have something up their sleeve still, but I was a little surprised that we just got a prototype.”
McNeill said he was expecting Tesla to reveal a roadmap, to explain what will happen and when in order to really build confidence in the brand. And confidence, he says, comes through more specifics.
(After our interview during Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, Musk said he hopes to launch an autonomous ride-hail service in California and Texas in 2025.)
McNeill’s presentation was all about how Tesla has been successful through simplifying processes. I asked him if Tesla’s choice to pursue self-driving through only cameras, rather than relying on lidar and radar, was a sort of false simplification. Yes, using only cameras might simplify the sensor stack, but it creates a lot more work on the back end.
On top of being an automaker, an EV charging company, and a solar company, Tesla is now building Dojo, a supercomputer that it hopes will help it train the neural nets necessary to achieve full self-driving through vision alone. And Dojo is a bet that Musk has admitted might not pan out.
McNeill expressed his concern for Tesla’s vision-only approach. “Human beings can drive a car, and we only have two eyes. So if you give a car eight eyes, it ought to be able to solve the problem, right? But I think that misses part of the challenge, and that is, there are things that cause us not to be able to see,” he said. Like snow, fog, sun glare, darkness, and other objects.
“Having eyes may not be sufficient. Lidar can see through all those things … and I think when people’s lives are at stake, you don’t cut costs or pinch pennies because there’s a safety issue. And so some people say you can solve it just with vision, but I wonder if that’s really true because I’m not sure human vision is adequate. That’s why we have 40,000 traffic deaths a year.”
Caveat: McNeill is on the board of GM’s Cruise, which commercialized Level 4 autonomy using lidar before its fleet was suspended last year following a safety incident.
“If the eye can’t see through the dark, through the rain, around the corner, etc., I don’t know how supercompute solves that.”
Tesla has backed its vision-only approach for years. It hasn’t panned out yet, and it might not ever get there. I asked McNeill whether it would be crazy for Tesla to reintroduce lidar back into the system. Or has the automaker sunk its costs into cameras?
McNeill said lidar costs have come down so much that from a financial standpoint, it wouldn’t be a huge problem for Tesla to adopt the sensor. But from a reputational standpoint? McNeill said Tesla has a track record of not being fearful of the sunk cost fallacy or even frustrating the customer.
He pointed to Musk’s statements from at least 2019 that any Tesla purchased then would have the compute and sensor set necessary for full self-driving when the feature became available. Tesla has had to walk back on that promise, and during the automaker’s third-quarter earnings call, Musk said vehicles with outdated hardware will receive a free retrofit to accommodate unsupervised FSD.
Fisker is going through a messy bankruptcy. Rivian is losing roughly $30,000 per car it produces. Canoo has changed its business model so many times, we’ve lost track. In short, building cars from the ground up is hard. Do you need someone as wild as Elon Musk at the helm to be successful? I asked.
“I do think you need a crazy, effective leader to make it through the gauntlet of everything that you have to prove as a car company,” McNeill said. “It’s hard to describe how difficult it is to take 10,000 parts from 72 countries and make a car out of it, and then put the software together and make the car run. Like manufacturing these things is really, really, really the hard part.”
Reflecting on his disappointment with Tesla’s robotaxi event, McNeill said that it’s really easy to produce a prototype, but it’s really hard to produce at mass scale.
“That’s where the car industry is incredibly brutal, and even for incumbents,” he said. “You see Stellantis now really struggling. You see Volkswagen really struggling. It’s because the fixed costs are so high. If you don’t get the product right and you don’t sell it, it’s merciless.”"

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/nasdaq-ceo-adena-friedman-isnt-surprised-we-havent-seen-a-resurgence-in-startup-ipos-yet/,Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman isn't surprised we haven't seen a resurgence in startup IPOs yet | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-10-27,"While many venture investors, and likely their LPs, were hoping IPOs were going to come back in 2024, that hasn’t happened and isn’t likely to in the next two months.
Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman isn’t surprised.
Friedman said at Axios’s BFD event on Tuesday that while on paper the public markets have been experiencing a spectacular year with the S&P 500 up about 22%, there’s more to the story than the headline number. Friedman said that the S&P is overweight toward larger cap companies, as it should be. And on the strength of such companies as Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and so on, this index of companies has performed well.
But not all areas of the public market are having a great year, and those companies with smaller valuations are really struggling.
“It’s a little bit of a tale of two cities,” Friedman said. “Large cap, which has done very well, and you can kind of see in the S&P 500, you have a 10% kind of valuation increase in a large cap. But if you look at the small cap index, they’re actually down 10%.”
While the exact definition of a small cap company varies, there is a general agreement that it refers to companies under $2 billion, which would fit a substantial amount of today’s late-stage startups. So that’s a data point telling them investors aren’t so interested in them.
Many late-stage startups are also not fully ready to go out and have a successful IPO, Friedman said. Companies want to have a really strong year of financials before they debut, which many companies likely don’t have yet after a tougher 2022 and 2023. And, in this atmosphere of higher interest rates, any company that is still in the red and burning through cash to support its growth could face a particularly harsh reception from public investors.
“They want to have 12 months of really strong performance before they start to think about coming out,” Friedman said. “The cost of capital environment has made it so that companies, those that are relying on capital to continue to grow their businesses, are definitely trading at a discount.”
It doesn’t hurt that the private markets have become a safer place for companies to hang out as well. The secondaries market has been particularly hot all year — where investors buy stock in private companies, often in company-approved transactions. This has allowed late-stage companies to get some needed liquidity for their investors and/or employees. So it doesn’t seem like VCs are really pushing their portfolio companies toward the public market in these not-ideal conditions. One example is telemedicine provider Ro, last valued at $6.6 billion when it raised cash in 2022. Ro CEO Zach Reitano said the benefits of staying a private company are growing just about an hour before Friedman took the stage.
Friedman said she thinks IPOs will start to return with momentum in 2025. She added that there have been some positive recent biotech IPOs that have shown there is appetite for these younger companies. For instance, Tempus AI had a successful debut in June, raising $410 million. So did Bicara Therapeutics in September, raising $362 million, among others. However, despite Friedman’s optimism, some of the biotechs that went public this year didn’t see their share prices maintain their IPO-day prices.
She also naturally thinks that there is a good reason for companies to go public, as it spreads the wealth to more than just a handful of private investors.
There were 14 venture-backed IPOs in the U.S. this year through the third quarter, according to PitchBook data. There have been 51 in total so far in 2024, meaning this year may not even match last year’s 86 total or 2022’s 81.
There does seem to be more momentum for a 2025 IPO market brewing already with names like Chime, Klarna, and CoreWeave all seemingly moving in that direction."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/26/openais-whisper-transcription-tool-has-hallucination-issues-researchers-say/,"OpenAI’s Whisper transcription tool has hallucination issues, researchers say | TechCrunch",Anthony Ha,2024-10-26,"Software engineers, developers, and academic researchers have serious concerns about transcriptions from OpenAI’s Whisper, according to a report in the Associated Press.
While there’s been no shortage of discussion around generative AI’s tendency to hallucinate — basically, to make stuff up — it’s a bit surprising that this is an issue in transcription, where you’d expect the transcript to closely follow the audio being transcribed.
Instead researchers told the AP that Whisper has introduced everything from racial commentary to imagined medical treatments into transcripts. And that could be particularly disastrous as Whisper is adopted in hospitals and other medical contexts.
A University of Michigan researcher studying public meetings found hallucinations in eight out of every 10 audio transcriptions. A machine learning engineer studied more than 100 hours of Whisper transcriptions and found hallucinations in more than half of them. And a developer reported finding hallucinations in nearly all the 26,000 transcriptions he created with Whisper.
An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is “continually working to improve the accuracy of our models, including reducing hallucinations” and noted that its usage policies prohibit using Whisper “in certain high-stakes decision-making contexts.”
“We thank researchers for sharing their findings,” they said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/26/openai-denies-its-releasing-a-model-called-orion-this-year/,OpenAI denies it's releasing a model called 'Orion' this year | TechCrunch,Cody Corrall,2024-10-26,"Welcome back to Week in Review. This week, we’re looking at OpenAI’s reported plans for its next AI model; a buzzy new messaging app that’s a hit with Gen Z; and Tim Cook discovering that you can name a group chat in iMessage. Let’s get into it.
The Verge noted this week that OpenAI is reportedly planning to release its next frontier AI model, code-named Orion, by December. An OpenAI spokesperson denied the claim to TechCrunch, saying, “We don’t have plans to release a model code-named Orion this year.” But what that means is anybody’s guess and leaves OpenAI substantial wiggle room.
Character.AI is being targeted in a lawsuit after the suicide of a 14-year-old boy whose mother says he became obsessed with a chatbot on the platform. The company said it is rolling out new safety features, including “improved detection, response, and intervention” related to chats that violate its terms of service and a notification when a user has spent an hour in a chat.
More than 100 million individuals had their private health information stolen during the February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare. It’s the first time that UnitedHealth Group, the health insurance provider that owns the company, has put a number on the amount of individuals affected by the data breach; previously the company said it anticipated the breach included data on a “substantial proportion of people in America.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/26/apple-wins-250-from-masimo-in-watch-patent-trial/,Apple wins $250 from Masimo in watch patent trial | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-10-26,"A federal jury ruled Friday that Masimo smartwatches infringed Apple patents, but Apple isn’t getting a big payday.
Bloomberg Law reports that the company was only seeking the statutory minimum of $250, and that’s all it was awarded. Apple’s attorney John Desmarais reportedly told jurors, “We’re not here for the money.” Instead, he said the company hoped to force Masimo to “stop copying our design.”
The company may have been disappointed on that front. The jury did find that the original design for Masimo’s W1 Freedom and health module, as well as its original charger, infringed on Apple design patents and that the infringement was willful.
However, in a statement, Masimo noted that the findings only applied to “a discontinued module and charger,” not its current products.
“Apple primarily sought an injunction against Masimo’s current products, and the jury’s verdict is a victory for Masimo on that issue,” the medical device company said.
The trial resulted from Apple’s countersuit in its ongoing legal battle with Masimo, which started with the Masimo’s claim that its patents had been infringed by the Apple Watch’s pulse-oximetry feature, which allows Watch owners to measure their blood oxygen levels. Apple disabled the feature in the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, and it’s also missing from the new Series 10. These limitations only apply in the United States, with Apple is appealing an import ban on models with the contested feature.
Desmarais reportedly told the jury that the pulse-oximetry feature “has nothing to do with this case.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/26/vc-megadeals-are-booming-and-ai-is-surprisingly-not-the-top-category/,VC megadeals are booming — and AI is surprisingly not the top category | TechCrunch,Julie Bort,2024-10-26,"Ask any VC if we’re still in a venture capital bear market and that investor will almost certainly tell you no, that funding is still flowing for good companies.
That might sound like spin, because anecdotes abound about how rough it still is for those raising now. And for good reason. Down rounds — that is, raising at a lower valuation than a previous round, which founders want to avoid unless they have no choice — were still at near record highs through the first half of 2024, according to Aumni’s Venture Beacon report. Around 39% of late-stage deals were a down round, according to Aumni’s report. That covers Series B and beyond, with the biggest percentage of down rounds at Series C and beyond.
Even Stripe — whose success no one questions — hasn’t fully rebounded to its 2021 $95 billion valuation as of a big secondary transaction that took place in July. Although it did climb back to $70 billion by then.
But despite this kind of gloom, late 2024 stats are full of good news, too. For instance, new data from Crunchbase shows a downright boom in megadeals — funding rounds of $100 million or more.
Crunchbase tracked nearly 240 mega-rounds for U.S.-based startups so far this year, which is already more than the 210 raised all of last year.
Even more interesting is that Crunchbase’s top category for these deals was not AI. Biotech and healthcare startups accounted for 87 mega-deals, compared to 26 for second-place category AI.
Some of these rounds are admittedly crossover: companies working on AI for healthcare. For instance, Crunchbase calls out AI drug discovery company Xaira Therapeutics as one of the notable health tech megadeals. Xaira launched in April with a massive $1 billion round led by ARCH Venture Partners and Foresite Labs (both known for biotech), but with classic Silicon Valley VCs in the round, too, like NEA, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, SV Angel, and others.
We’d arguably call Xaira an AI company and included it in our ongoing list tracking AI startup megadeals.
But there were also deals like Superluminal Medicines’ $120 million Series A, led by Eli Lilly. While it is also using machine learning to speed drug creation, its focus is finding medications for certain small molecule receptors on cell membranes. That’s a hot area in biotech right now — no AI-washing required. The deal was backed by classic tech investors Insight Partners and Gaingels, as well as NVentures (Nvidia’s venture capital arm), which seems to be everywhere these days.
Other biotech Series A and B megadeals include the $120 million Series B closed by Terray Therapeutics, which is also working on small molecule drugs; and the $100 million Series A Judo Bio landed to tackle kidney drugs. A new biotech megadeal seems to be announced every week.
Beyond health tech and AI, another sector nabbing mega-rounds is cybersecurity, with 16 such deals so far this year. Examples include email security startup Kiteworks raising $456 million, data security startup Cyera raising $300 million, and cloud security startup Wiz raising a whopping $1 billion.
There are a few other goods sign for founders at earlier stages. Pre-money valuations improved slightly for seed and Series A deals in the first half of the year, Aumni found.
The dealmaking in 2024 also appears to be at a similar pace as 2023, according to the Q3 PitchBook-NVCA Venture Monitor. In 2023 it clocked in at just under 16,000 deals, which was just a bit higher than the average annual activity before the pandemic and ZIRP-fueled frenzy of 2020-21.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/26/the-hisense-c2-ultra-is-a-well-rounded-great-looking-home-projector/,"The Hisense C2 Ultra is a well-rounded, great-looking home projector | TechCrunch",Brian Heater,2024-10-26,"I’ll be the first to admit that I’m new to the projector game. Anker won me over at the end of last year with its Nebula series. The Capsule prioritizes ease of use and portability, above all. While not cheap at $800, it’s a good starter projector in the sense that it’s self-contained and largely works out of the box.
Since buying a house this summer, however, I’ve begun rethinking my relationship to the device. I have a lot more space in my new place, but for all its natural beauty, the Hudson Valley is wanting for entertainment options compared to my close to two decades in New York City.
I reached out to Hisense a few months back, after hearing good things about its projector offerings. For once, my timing was perfect. In September, the Chinese firm announced additions to its C-series “lifestyle” projectors. Moving from the Nebula Capsule to the C2 Ultra is like trading in a Toyota Camry for a Porsche. They serve their respective purposes, and comparing them directly feels unfair to all parties involved.
For one thing, the Hisense jumps a projector tax bracket or two, with a $3,000 price tag. For the same price, you can pick up a 100-inch Hisense 4K flat screen. This is a projector for people who are wholly committed to the projector lifestyle.
It’s also significantly larger than the Capsule, so there is a portability trade-off. I would pull Anker’s projector out of the closet a couple times a week when I wanted to watch something projected on the big screen. The C2 Ultra is the kind of projector you clear out space for. Much like a TV, it will take up a permanent place in your living room. For me, that place is atop a bookshelf.
The projector’s topline is the Tri-Chroma red, green, and blue triple-laser engine, which is a marquee feature for Hisense’s high-end projectors. In addition to a wide and accurate color gamut, the projector is extremely bright, at 3,000 ANSI Lumens. You can watch a film during the day without blackout curtains.
The C2 can project images up to 300 inches from 6 meters, with a minimum size of 65 inches. That covers most home projector screens and then some, should you want to do movie night in the backyard. There are other innovative features on board as well, including a 1.67 optical zoom that lets you get in tighter on a shot without degrading the image.
I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of setup as well. It’s not quite plug-and-play, but it’s close. The auto keystone correction maps the projector screen quickly. Ditto for autofocus. If you don’t have a screen, the projector will detect the color of the wall and adjust the picture accordingly. From there, it’s a matter of getting onto the Wi-Fi and logging into different streaming services.
The system comes preloaded with Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Paramount+, Tubi, and Disney+, among others. Some, like Hulu and Max, were notably missing. Ultimately, I ended up connecting Apple TV 4K through the first HDMI input. Along with a full streaming service selection, that allowed me to stream audio to a pair of connected HomePods.
That said, the built-in JBL speaker and subwoofer are perfectly serviceable for movie night. I suspect, however, that those looking to spend $3,000 on a projector are probably also investing in a stand-alone sound system. It comes mounted on a stand from which it can’t be detached. Along with bringing height to the projector, it makes for smooth manual adjustments.
The C2 Ultra is a well-balanced, self-contained projector that’s filled with all sorts of nice touches. It’s available now."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/26/jon-mcneills-lessons-on-innovation-through-subtraction/,Jon McNeill’s lessons on innovation through subtraction | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-10-26,"Before Jon McNeill was CEO at VC firm DVx Ventures, he was the president of Tesla and chief operating officer at Lyft. He helped Tesla grow its revenue run rate from $2 billion to $20 billion in 30 months, and he doubled Lyft’s revenue ahead of its IPO. He’s also on the board of GM’s Cruise and Lululemon, among other companies. So when he comes out with advice for how to build an innovative company, startups listen.
During the World Business Forum this week in New York City, McNeill presented insights into building innovative companies, a method Tesla CEO Elon Musk calls “the algorithm.” This approach, covered in Walter Isaacson’s biography of Musk, emphasizes radically simplifying both goals and processes.
McNeill’s key lesson: Start by identifying the problem you’re solving, then aim for massive (not incremental) goals. “Order of magnitude big,” he said.
He recounted Tesla’s 2017 “production hell” when the company, facing bankruptcy, sought to boost digital sales of the $100,000 Model S by 20x. Tesla reduced the 63 clicks to buy a car online to 10, simplifying both the process and the supply chain.
McNeill’s takeaway for startups?
“The answer isn’t ‘No,’ or ‘It’s crazy.’ The answer in innovative communities is: ‘I have no idea how to do that, but we’ll try.’”
The only requirements McNeill said are truly important are requirements of the law and requirements of physics. Everything else can be poked and prodded at.
“When you have a large organization, things that started out as a good idea can become a rule, and then those rules can become requirements,” McNeill told TechCrunch. “And it’s almost like a tribal myth or a telephone game. And so [Musk] wants to really understand, is this a real requirement, or is this something that somebody thought was a good idea that, over time, has been codified into a requirement?”
McNeill advises companies to track every process in a spreadsheet so they can identify only the steps that add value to the customer. Everything else they should delete, with the caveat that they can always add some of those steps back in if needed.
“Until you have to add back in 10% of steps, you haven’t cut deeply enough,” he said.
For managers to succeed at this, they need to spend 20% of their time on the front lines, he said. If you’re the CEO of Starbucks, that means rolling up your sleeves and understanding not only how to make a cup of coffee end to end, but also understanding why your customers are frustrated with that process.
In 2018, when Tesla was trying to figure out how to ramp production of Model 3s, Tesla executive Jerome Guillen realized Tesla had over-automated production. He said the company needed to go back to basics, and for him, that meant building a massive tent in which the team could build the cars by hand.
McNeill says the Model 3s were built this way, manually, for months, which helped Tesla simplify the production process further when the team eventually moved the line back inside the main building.
“They were able to remove more than 50% of the steps because they had just optimized the process manually,” McNeill said.
“Simplifying and optimizing can really work into the fourth step, which is to then apply speed,” McNeill said. “Speed exposes all the weaknesses in the process.”
McNeill says speed matters more than ever today.
“When cash costs 5%, [simplification] speeds up your cash generation,” he said. “Cash velocity is really the metric of elite performers.”
Only after companies have simplified the process and really understand the product and customer journey should they move to automation.
“Automation is like the bolts in the floor,” McNeill said. “Once you begin to write code, it gets very hard to unwind it and hard to replace it.”
“You automate to make it repeatable, and you automate to make it scalable, and you only do that when you have a repeatable and scalable process.”
On top of the five lessons, McNeill provided three extra cultural principles.
The first is that companies should expand their view to include the entire customer journey or experience. An example? GM is really good at producing cars, and that includes its EVs. But charging is part of that customer journey, something GM didn’t latch on to right away. Tesla did when it built its Supercharger network.
His second ingredient is to inject urgency and accountability by identifying the two or three things that matter to a company at any given time. The CEO should be allowed to concentrate entirely on those things.
The third ingredient is to experience the product as your customer experiences the product. Or as McNeill put it: “Eat your own dog food.”"

The manufacturers have to license each technician, and they put locks on the McFlurry machines to prevent others from repairing them.
However, 404 Media spotted a new federal ruling on Friday declaring that technicians can legally hack their way around the locks put on McFlurry machines by the manufacturer. This means that more technicians will be able to repair McDonald’s ice cream machines and is widely seen as a win for the right to repair community.
iFixit, which posts how-to’s for the tech repair community, posted a breakdown of McFlurry machines last year, showing how to circumvent these locks with a simple device, which McDonald’s previously asked franchise owners not to use. Now, franchise owners are free to use them."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/naacp-launches-200-million-fund-of-funds/,NAACP launches $200 million fund of funds | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-10-25,"The NAACP announced today NAACP Capital, a $200 million fund of funds to back fund managers focused on issues that impact people of color.
The fund was conceived in partnership with Kapor Capital and Kapor Center, along with nine other venture fund managers. Last year, Crunchbase found that Black founders raised less than 1% of all venture capital funds and that the group has raised 0.3% in the first half of this year.
A fund of funds is when an investor invests in multiple venture funds, rather than making individual investments in funds, or even in startups. It’s a popular way for an influential investor to put their money to the broadest possible use. Kapor is a VC firm that has always been focused on racial justice investing. But other big names have used a similar approach. Melinda Gates’ Pivotal Ventures, for instance, invests in women-led funds, as well as directly in startups."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/yikes-while-gaming-musk-inadvertently-broadcasts-scary-near-abort-of-starship-booster-landing/,"'Yikes': While gaming, Musk inadvertently broadcasts 'scary' near-abort of Starship booster landing | TechCrunch",Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-25,"Elon Musk occasionally posts clips of his video game plays to his social media platform X — but a recent clip includes background audio of a SpaceX engineer telling Musk how the most recent Starship flight test was “one second away” from an abort. The clip, posted on Friday, was caught by Reuters’ Joey Roulette on X, but it’s not clear if the conversation between Musk and Starship engineers occurred that same day.
“I want to be really upfront about scary shit that happened,” the unnamed engineer said, seemingly as Musk played Diablo IV. He went on to explain that a misconfigured component didn’t have the right “ramp up time for bringing up spin pressure” on the booster.
“We were one second away from that tripping and telling the rocket to abort and try to crash into the ground next to the tower,” the engineer says.
“Wow,” Musk says in response. “Yikes.”
The same engineer went on to say that right before engine startup on the booster’s descent back to Earth, a cover on the skin of the booster ripped off, apparently in a place that had been spot welded. “We wouldn’t have predicted the exact right place, but this cover that ripped off was right on top of a bunch of the single point failure valves that must work during the landing burn. So thankfully, none of those or the harnessing got damaged, but we ripped this chine cover off over some really critical equipment right as landing burn was starting. We have a plan to address that.”
Musk was being briefed on the fifth Starship integrated test flight, referred to as IFT-5, which took place on October 13. SpaceX set its most ambitious mission objectives yet for that test, including returning the Super Heavy booster to the launch site and catching it with a pair of oversized “chopstick” arms that jut out from the launch tower.
The company pulled it off, and made history as a result. The full context of the conversation is not clear, as the clip posted to X is only about three minutes long, but it shows that even seemingly flawless rocket launches (and in this case, booster landings) can come perilously close to disaster. And that after each test, SpaceX is furnished with a “butt load,” as the engineer put it, of post-flight data to inform future testing.
“We’re trying to do a reasonable balance of speed and risk mitigation on the booster” prior to the next flight attempt, the engineer said. The engineers note that this will be the first Starship test flight whose schedule is not set by the FAA. While SpaceX has typically outpaced the regulator in terms of launch readiness, versus the FAA’s launch license approval schedule, the FAA actually gave approval for IFT-5 and IFT-6 at the same time."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/ftc-hits-lyft-with-2-1m-penalty-for-luring-drivers-with-false-earnings-claims/,FTC hits Lyft with $2.1M penalty for luring drivers with false earnings claims | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-25,"Lyft has agreed to a $2.1 million settlement proposed by the FTC over the car-hailing company’s “deceptive earnings claims about how much money drivers could expect to make.”
As documented in the FTC’s complaint document, Lyft systematically inflated the incomes it advertised to drivers it was attempting to recruit in 2021 and 2022. For instance, in LA it suggested drivers would be offered up to $43 per hour. “Lyft failed to disclose that these amounts did not represent the income an average driver could expect to earn, but instead were based on the earnings of the top one-fifth of drivers,” and the difference was up to 30%.
“Lyft claimed that Drivers in New Jersey could earn up to $34 per hour when Lyft’s own calculations put the median earnings at only $25 per hour. In the same month, Lyft claimed that Drivers in Boston could earn up to $42 per hour when median earnings were just $33 per hour,” the FTC wrote in the complaint.
Not only that, but the advertised hourly rates were inclusive of customer-provided tips, while implying to any normal reader that it was a base rate. So the effective rate was likely $5 to $10 lower even than the unstated average.
It also made misleading promises about promotions and incentives, according to the FTC.
“For example, one guarantee promised drivers they would make $975 if they completed 45 rides in a weekend. But these guarantees did not clearly disclose that drivers were only paid the difference between what they actually earned, and Lyft’s advertised guaranteed amount,” the FTC said in its press release.
While this was clear in the fine print, the language used was misleading, and Lyft received thousands of complaints from its drivers — a group that, the FTC points out, is composed disproportionately of people for whom English is not their native language.
The FTC warned Lyft in October 2021 that its practices were illegal, and it must stop — but it continued them, and the result is this order and penalty.
Of course, $2.1 million is a drop in the bucket for Lyft, one of the two globally dominant ride-hailing platforms. But the company has already had to shape up its payment promises: It can’t include tips in its estimates of hourly rates, for instance, and it must more clearly explain promotions like “guaranteed” income.
Notably, two FTC Commissioners dissented from the decision, saying that the agency was overstepping in pursuing the “earn up to” language as misleading. But Commissioner Ferguson’s argument, while coherent, amounts to “consumers know that advertisers exaggerate and lie” and would not take the “earn up to” number as representative of expected earnings. Perhaps more convincingly, they argue that Lyft wasn’t adequately notified it was breaking the law.
“Nor are workers protected when the Commission claims victory on dubious legal theories as it settles complaints for pennies on the dollar with businesses that are happy to pay the Commission to go away,” writes Ferguson — a fair point."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/what-is-apple-intelligence-when-is-coming-and-who-will-get-it/,"What is Apple Intelligence, when is it coming and who will get it? | TechCrunch",Brian Heater,2024-10-25,"After months of speculation, Apple Intelligence took center stage at WWDC 2024 in June. The platform was announced in the wake of a torrent of generative AI news from companies like Google and Open AI, causing concern that the famously tight-lipped tech giant had missed the boat on the latest tech craze.
Contrary to such speculation, however, Apple had a team in place, working on what proved to be a very Apple approach to artificial intelligence. There was still pizzazz amid the demos — Apple always loves to put on a show — but Apple Intelligence is ultimately a very pragmatic take on the category.
Apple Intelligence (yes, AI for short) isn’t a standalone feature. Rather, it’s about integrating into existing offerings. While it is a branding exercise in a very real sense, the large language model (LLM) driven technology will operate behind the scenes. As far as the consumer is concerned, the technology will mostly present itself in the form of new features for existing apps.
We learned more during the Apple’s iPhone 16 event, which was held on September 9. During the event, Apple touted a number of AI-powered features coming to their devices, from translation on the Apple Watch Series 10, visual search on iPhones and a number of tweaks to Siri’s capabilities. The first wave of Apple Intelligence is arriving at the end of October, as part of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1. A second wave of features are available as part of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2 developer betas.
The features launched first in U.S. English. Apple has since added Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, South African, and U.K. English localizations.
Support for Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will arrive in 2025. Notably, users in both China and the EU may not get any access to Apple Intelligence features, owing to regulatory hurdles.
Cupertino marketing executives have branded Apple Intelligence: “AI for the rest of us.” The platform is designed to leverage the things that generative AI already does well, like text and image generation, to improve upon existing features. Like other platforms including ChatGPT and Google Gemini, Apple Intelligence was trained on large information models. These systems use deep learning to form connections, whether it be text, images, video or music.
The text offering, powered by LLM, presents itself as Writing Tools. The feature is available across various Apple apps, including Mail, Messages, Pages and Notifications. It can be used to provide summaries of long text, proofread and even write messages for you, using content and tone prompts.
Image generation has been integrated as well, in similar fashion — albeit a bit less seamlessly. Users can prompt Apple Intelligence to generate custom emojis (Genmojis) in an Apple house style. Image Playground, meanwhile, is a standalone image generation app that utilizes prompts to create visual content than can be used in Messages, Keynote or shared via social media.
Apple Intelligence also marks a long-awaited face-lift for Siri. The smart assistant was early to the game, but has mostly been neglected for the past several years. Siri is integrated much more deeply into Apple’s operating systems; for instance, instead of the familiar icon, users will see a glowing light around the edge of their iPhone screen when it’s doing its thing.
More important, new Siri works across apps. That means, for example, that you can ask Siri to edit a photo and then insert it directly into a text message. It’s a frictionless experience the assistant had previously lacked. Onscreen awareness means Siri uses the context of the content you’re currently engaged with to provide an appropriate answer.
The first wave of Apple Intelligence arrives in October via iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18., and macOS Sequoia 15.1 updates. These include integrated writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for the redesigned Siri experience.
Many remaining features will be added with the forthcoming release of of October, as part of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1. A second wave of features are available as part of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2. That list includes, Genmoji, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence, Image Wand, and ChatGPT integration.
The offering will be free to use, so long as you have one of the following pieces of hardware:
Notably, only the Pro versions of the iPhone 15 are getting access, owing to shortcomings on the standard model’s chipset. Presumably, however, the whole iPhone 16 line will be able to run Apple Intelligence when it arrives.
Apple has taken a small-model, bespoke approach to training. Rather than relying on the kind of kitchen sink approach that fuels platforms like GPT and Gemini, the company has compiled datasets in-house for specific tasks like, say, composing an email. The biggest benefit of this approach is that many of these tasks become far less resource intensive and can be performed on-device.
That doesn’t apply to everything, however. More complex queries will utilize the new Private Cloud Compute offering. The company now operates remote servers running on Apple Silicon, which it claims allows it to offer the same level of privacy as its consumer devices. Whether an action is being performed locally or via the cloud will be invisible to the user, unless their device is offline, at which point remote queries will toss up an error.
A lot was made about Apple’s pending partnership with OpenAI ahead of WWDC. Ultimately, however, it turned out that the deal was less about powering Apple Intelligence and more about offering an alternative platform for those things it’s not really built for. It’s a tacit acknowledgement that building a small-model system has its limitation.
Apple Intelligence is free. So, too, is access to ChatGPT. However, those with paid accounts to the latter will have access to premium features free users don’t, including unlimited queries.
ChatGPT integration, which debuts on iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2, has two primary roles: supplementing Siri’s knowledge base and adding to the existing Writing Tools options.
With the service enabled, certain questions will prompt the new Siri to ask the user to approve its accessing ChatGPT. Recipes and travel planning are examples of questions that may surface the option. Users can also directly prompt Siri to “ask ChatGPT.”
Compose is the other primary ChatGPT feature available through Apple Intelligence. Users can access it in any app that supports the new Writing Tools feature. Compose adds the ability to write content based on a prompt. That joins existing writing tools like Style and Summary.
We know for sure that Apple plans to partner with additional generative AI services. The company all but said that Google Gemini is next on that list.

Want it in your inbox every Friday? Sign up here.
Several startups announced new rounds this week without disclosing their valuation. This doesn’t mean that these were down rounds, but rather it confirms that our collective focus has shifted far away from unicorns: These days, $1 billion can be the ARR (annual recurring revenue) figure a company wants to hit before going public.
IPOs are making their way back into the conversation, but not everyone is lamenting their absence.
Secondhand: Vinted was valued at €5 billion in a secondary share sale. The Lithuanian secondhand marketplace joins the growing number of European scale-ups that have followed this route to unlock liquidity for their stakeholders in the absence of IPOs on their roadmap.
Bright side: Ro CEO Zachariah Reitano would “never say never” to taking the telehealth company public, but he thinks the benefits of being a private company are growing, he said in a recent interview.
Checking boxes: Checking boxes: Wiz hopes that 2025 will be the year its ARR reaches $1 billion, a number its co-founders see as a prerequisite for the cybersecurity company to go public after it declined to get acquired by Google for $23 billion.
Big moves: Fintech company Groww is one of several Indian startups that are relocating their headquarters to India to better comply with local legislation and potentially go public more easily, TechCrunch’s Manish Singh reported.
Tailwinds: U.S. federal regulators have cleared the way for electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to share U.S. airspace with planes and helicopters, a big win for startups in this category.
Just a handful of AI-related funding rounds this week, but AI will be central to some really big ones that may be around the corner.
Counter-Stripe: One year after becoming a payment processor, fintech startup Finix raised a $75 million Series C round of funding that will help it grow in the U.S. and expand into more countries.
Money circle: Concentric AI recently raised a $45 million Series B round. The San Mateo-based startup operates in the data security posture management space, which had several M&As in recent years.
Open checks: Socket raised $40 million to detect security vulnerabilities in open source code, which software companies are increasingly relying on.
Augmented: Fixify closed a $25 million Series A round to help IT teams deal with ticket overload thanks to a combination of automation and human analysts.
Rumors: AI search engine Perplexity is reportedly seeking to raise $500 million. Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati is also said to be fundraising for a new AI startup.
Ducks in a row: Privacy-focused company DuckDuckGo will invest into similarly minded early-stage startups and consider acquisitions. Its past investments include AI model training platform EverArt, TechCrunch learned.
Breathing room: Andreessen Horowitz is making a private GPU cluster available to AI startups in its portfolio through a program called Oxygen, the VC firm confirmed this week.
Partners only: Filings revealed that Benchmark is raising $170 million for a new fund. TechCrunch understands this will be a partners-only fund, where most of the funding will come from the firm’s historical and current partners.
Old and new: U.S. VC veteran firm General Catalyst raised $8 billion in fresh funds. As for new VC firm Chemistry, it raised $350 million for its debut fund.
The race for AI foundational models is only beginning, and smaller startups still stand a chance, Accel partner Philippe Botteri told TechCrunch. This includes European ones, despite the fundraising gap with their U.S. peers."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/rental-car-startup-kyte-slashes-staff-and-shrinks-to-two-markets-in-bid-for-survival/,Rental car startup Kyte slashes staff and shrinks to two markets in bid for survival | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-25,"Rental car startup Kyte, which bills itself as the “best alternative to Hertz,” is pulling out of almost all of its major markets in the United States and has cut its workforce roughly in half in a bid to survive after exploring a sale earlier this year.
The company is shrinking its operations to focus only on San Francisco and New York City (including Jersey City) as it works to reach profitability in the next 18 months, CEO Nikolaus Volk told TechCrunch. Kyte has been exiting other major markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Seattle. It started telling customers in Los Angeles that it is suspending operations in that city after November 7, as Curbivore reported Thursday.
Volk said Kyte recently cut between 40% and 50% of its workforce. The engineering, consumer, and growth product teams were among the most heavily affected, former employees told TechCrunch.
“In a capital-constrained environment, where capital is super expensive, we have to focus on our strongest markets,” Volk said. “Hard decisions had to be made in order to sustain the business here.” Volk noted that New York and San Francisco are Kyte’s biggest markets, accounting for about 70% of its revenue.
Kyte raised $9 million in 2021 and closed a $60 million Series B in 2022, all on the premise of being a flexible, easy-to-use rental car service that would go so far as to deliver the vehicle to your door. When announcing the Series B raise, the company said it wanted to be the world’s “largest operator of shared, electrified, and autonomous fleets.”
The company rapidly expanded to more than a dozen markets in the U.S., and started borrowing heavily to finance the purchase of its vehicles. The company struck a $200 million debt financing deal in 2022 with Goldman Sachs and Ares Capital, and another $250 million agreement in March 2024 with Barclays and Waterfall Asset Management.
Over the summer, though, Volk said it was becoming clear that the unit economics of Kyte’s business did not currently work well enough to generate free cash flow in those markets. He said his team explored selling the business at one point but decided to restructure instead in favor of reaching profitability first.
That was only going to be possible if Kyte narrowed its focus, he said, hence the restructuring. Volk also said that the company recently completed a new fundraise to capitalize the restructured business, but he said he was not ready to share how much.
The rental and subscription car service space has gone through hard times recently, especially for companies that leaned heavily into electrification.
Hertz said in 2021 that it was going to buy 100,000 Teslas to fill its rental fleet with electric cars, but the company wound up only purchasing around 35,000. It sold the majority of those earlier this year. Autonomy, a startup created by TrueCar founder Scott Painter, fell far short of its own goal to build a fleet of 23,000 EVs; earlier this year it announced a pivot to selling software services and data.
Despite the claims Kyte made in 2022, Volk said his company never got too deep in the process of filling its fleet with EVs — something that may have allowed the company to attempt this restructuring at all. That “was very good, retrospectively, that we did not lose a bunch of capital here on residual values falling down,” he said.
This story has been updated with additional context about revenue and cash flow in Kyte’s markets."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/prominent-crypto-critic-says-someone-offered-bribes-to-take-down-a-blog-post/,Prominent crypto critic says someone offered bribes to take down a blog post | TechCrunch,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-10-25,"In August, the crypto news website Web3 Is Going Just Great published a post about the arrest of Roman Ziemian, the founder of crypto trading platform FutureNet, which is alleged to have defrauded victims out of a combined $21 million.
For the news site’s administrator, Molly White, a software engineer and one of the world’s fiercest critics of the crypto industry, that was a routine post. For years, White has documented frauds, hacks, and scams perpetrated by influences, crypto project founders, and web3 companies on the website.
Then, last week, things got a bit less routine.
On October 18, a person who did not identify themselves but claimed to run a “reputation management company” that cleans up “clients image over the internet,” asked White to remove her X post about FutureNet and Ziemian, “which is about my client.”
The person then offered White a bribe of $200 to remove the corresponding post from Web3 Is Going Just Great, according to a copy of the exchange that White shared with TechCrunch.
White declined the offer, arguing that there were no errors in her posts. The unnamed person agreed, according to the response seen by TechCrunch, but nevertheless upped the price to $500.
White told TechCrunch that this “isn’t the first time someone has tried to intimidate me into removing my factual reporting, and it won’t be the first time they succeed,” but, White added, it was the first time someone offered her money to do it.
The unnamed person did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.
A few days later, someone identifying himself as a lawyer named Michael Woods emailed White. Citing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which governs U.S. copyright law, Woods alleged that White’s post infringed copyright because, they claimed, “this page content has been copied from our website,” according to the email exchange that White also shared with TechCrunch.
Woods included a link to a Blogspot website called “WP Media News” that shows the exact word-for-word content from White’s post, allegedly from August 18, 2024, a day before White’s post and purportedly written by Woods themselves.
At first glance, the Blogspot site appears to be some sort of a content farm filled with dozens of articles about various types of news, such as crypto fraud, sanctions against Russians, and COVID-19, going all the way back to 1995, and all authored by Woods. (TechCrunch found that the site was in part run on Rankify, a service that offers to generate “SEO optimized human-like content” using AI.)
White told the purported lawyer that, “there are penalties for filing false DMCA claims.” Woods responded by offering White $100 to “permanently remove” the same blog post about Ziemian.
White declined the offer.
TechCrunch was unable to ascertain if Woods is a real individual. The address Woods included in their email signature does not appear to exist in the real-world, as checked by TechCrunch. Woods listed an address in Los Angeles that appears to be a completely empty lot. And, there is no Michael Woods registered as a lawyer in Los Angeles, according to the California State Bar website.
Woods did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment sent via email and in a voicemail.
TechCrunch sent a request for comment to an email address used to register the FutureNet official website, but did not receive a response.
White told TechCrunch: “While I’m always happy to issue corrections if I have made an error, I do not remove posts simply because the people and companies I write about don’t like what I have to say.”
“If I did that, I suspect there wouldn’t be much left on my website,” said White."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/the-fediverse-is-getting-its-own-tiktok-competitor-called-loops/,The fediverse is getting its own TikTok competitor called Loops | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-10-25,"Similar to how Mastodon offers an open source, distributed version of X, the fediverse is getting its own TikTok competitor. This week, an app called Loops began accepting signups on its new platform for sharing short, looping videos. Still in the early stages, Loops is not yet open sourced, nor has it completed its integration with ActivityPub, the protocol that powers Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube, and other federated apps.
However, both those efforts are in the works and when complete, will allow Loops to add another layer of social activity to the growing open social web known as the fediverse, which now has north of 11.6 million users and over 1 million monthly active users. (Mastodon accounts for roughly 65% of that activity.) Growth in this space has also encouraged other apps to adopt ActivityPub, like social magazine app Flipboard and Meta’s Threads. The latter is not yet fully integrated but already has more than 200 million monthly active users.
Loops, meanwhile, was developed by Daniel Supernault, who also created the federated Instagram rival Pixelfed. In fact, Loops will run under the Pixelfed project, according to an FAQ on its website.
In addition to the eventual benefit of being open source and distributed, Loops claims it will not sell or provide user data to third-party advertisers, use your content to train AI models, or gain the rights to any content uploaded on its service. Instead, users only grant Loops permission to use their content, but will retain full ownership of their contributions, the Loops website explains.
Like many fediverse projects, Loops isn’t reliant on investor backing. To raise funds, Loops will seek user donations via Patreon, Open Collective, and Liberapay. It’s also in the process of finalizing a grant that will sustain Loops’ development for one year.
Aimed at users 13 and up, Loops will allow you to follow other users, as well as like, comment on, or share their videos. But as a part of the federated web — the open social web running on ActivityPub — remote users from other platforms like Mastodon and Pixelfed will also be able to follow users’ Loops accounts and then view the videos in their home feed on those respective platforms. These remote followers will also be able to like, comment on, or share videos if their platform supports it.
Videos published to the app will be held for moderation if the uploader has a low trust score, but trusted users will be able to skip the queue and publish immediately. The trust score is also used to hide problematic comments on posts and apply content warnings, Supernault notes.
Other features, like profile sharing or the ability for Loops users to follow Mastodon and Pixelfed users in return, are still “to be announced,” the site notes.
While signups for Loops are now open after a monthlong countdown period wrapped, interested testers will be emailed when it’s possible to actually start using the new app. (That might take a day or so, Supernault said, due to rate limiting.)
According to Supernault, a side-loadable APK will be made available to Android users, and an iOS app will initially arrive on Apple’s TestFlight testing service when approved. A web interface won’t be an immediate focus but will come later on.
Currently, the founder is also asking for community feedback on things like Loops terms and privacy policy and is searching for moderators."

“We don’t have plans to release a model code-named Orion this year,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “We do plan to release a lot of other great technology.”
The Verge reported on Thursday that Orion, which is expected to be OpenAI’s next frontier model, would launch by December, and that trusted partners would be the first to preview it ahead of a rollout through ChatGPT. According to The Verge, Microsoft, a close OpenAI collaborator and investor, expects to gain access to Orion as early as November.
OpenAI previously told TechCrunch that The Verge’s report wasn’t accurate, but declined to elaborate further.
Orion, a step up from OpenAI’s current flagship, GPT-4o, is reportedly trained in part on synthetic training data from o1, the company’s “reasoning” model. OpenAI plans for the foreseeable future to continue developing new “GPT” models alongside reasoning models like o1, which it sees as addressing fundamentally different use cases.
OpenAI’s statement leaves substantial wiggle room. It could be that the company’s next major model isn’t, in fact, Orion. Or perhaps OpenAI will release a new model by December, but one less capable than Orion.
At this point, it’s anyone’s guess."

Sixty-six years later, it’s getting a Spanish language rework courtesy of “responsible” AI.
Universal on Friday announced the release of “Noche Buena y Navidad,” which utilized SoundLabs AI’s MicDrop technology to reconstruct Spanish vocals based on the then 13-year-old Lee’s original.
Lee, now 79, appears to approve. “Throughout my career, I performed and recorded many songs in different languages, but I never recorded ‘Rockin’’ in Spanish, which I would have loved to do,” the singer says. “To have this out now is pretty incredible and I’m happy to introduce the song to fans in a new way.”
With the holiday now exactly two months out, it’s a safe bet music execs are dreaming on an AI Christmas."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/yc-startup-pharos-lands-a-5m-seed-led-by-felicis-to-bring-ai-to-quality-reporting/,YC startup Pharos lands a $5M seed led by Felicis to bring AI to hospital quality reporting | TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,2024-10-25,"Medical and administrative staff are increasingly overwhelmed with piles of paperwork they have to fill out every day.
Dozens, if not hundreds, of startups, are seeing opportunities to make those bureaucratic processes less burdensome with the help of generative AI. These companies are building AI medical scribes, platforms for pre-authorizing health insurance payments, and products for automatically extracting medical coding from patients’ electronic medical records (EMRs.)
But Pharos, a company that was a part of Y Combinator’s summer 2024 cohort, is applying AI to tackle another somewhat under-the-radar administrative function for hospitals: quality reporting to external clinical registries.
Organizations like Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the American College of Surgeons aim to measure each healthcare centers’ record on delivering safe and effective care for patients. Although reporting to these registries is not always mandatory, it’s often in the best interest of hospitals. These external organizations play a crucial role in identifying quality issues (such as an increase in post-surgery infections), which can be addressed to improve patient care.
However, reporting to the registries is extremely time-consuming. Nurses and other staff must manually sift through each patient’s electronic health record to extract the precise data required for each registry. “A single case can take up to eight hours” to report, said Ryan Isono, a partner at Felicis, “It’s a big problem, but one that you only know about if you’re deep in the industry.”
Indeed, Pharos was co-founded by Felix Brann and Matthew Jones, who had some exposure to the challenges of reporting data to medical registries from their prior work at Vital, a startup that develops software for emergency rooms. They recognized that AI can take unstructured data from EMRs and automatically populate forms required by registries. As they went through YC earlier this year, they added another co-founder – Alex Clarke, a medical doctor who also holds a PhD in artificial intelligence from Imperial College London.
On Friday, Pharos announced that Felicis, with participation from General Catalyst, Moxxie (the company’s pre-seed investor) and Y Combinator, led its $5 million seed round.
Pharos caught Felicis’ eye not only because the company could save hospitals money and free up nurses’ time for taking care of patients, but also because the area still doesn’t have other startups going after it, Isono said.
Brann (pictured center above) predicts that other quality reporting companies will emerge soon. “We have five years of experience selling and deploying into hospitals, and we have top-tier AI talent,” he said.” That Venn diagram doesn’t normally overlap. That’s why we think we’re going to win.”
For now, the entire Pharos team consists only of the three co-founders, but they will be using the capital to hire a team that will help the company sell the product and maintain relationships with hospitals."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/apple-upgrades-testflight-with-redesigned-invites-testing-criteria-and-more/,"Apple upgrades TestFlight with redesigned invites, testing criteria, and more | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-10-25,"Alongside the Apple Intelligence-powered iOS 18 updates for consumers and developers, Apple is rolling out a sizable refresh to its app testing platform for developers, TestFlight. Developers will have more control over who can join their beta and how an app’s new features are shared with testers. They’ll also be able to view metrics related to the beta’s success, in terms of how many people viewed the invite and opted in, and why others did not.
The changes will make it easier for developers to target their betas and gain more feedback ahead of their app’s public debut on the App Store. Meanwhile, for beta testers, the redesigned invitations will offer more information about the app, helping them make a decision as to whether or not they want to join the test group.
With the update,invitations now highlight new features or content coming to the app or game, which could encourage testers to try it out. In addition, Apple says the beta builds of apps and games that have been already approved for publication the App Store will be able to include screenshots and the app category along with their invite. This will make the beta testing experience feel more like downloading from the App Store. It could also challenge the alternative testing marketplaces that have popped up in recent years, like Airport, which includes app screenshots, and Departures, which organizes apps into categories.
The ability to set criteria for TestFlight testing, meanwhile, helps developers narrow their test groups to specific audiences, like those using a particular device type or OS version. Given that TestFlight offers a max of 10,000 invitations, this could help save spots in a more popular beta from going to those who can’t yet use the app on their device or aren’t a part of the intended audience for the test. Developers can set a maximum number of testers in the group, to further control access.
The new invites will also be sent out from a new public link that will include new metrics like how many testers viewed the invite and then chose to accept it. Developers will be able to see how many potential testers didn’t meet the criteria they set, as well. Users, meanwhile, will be able to leave feedback for the developer, to help them understand why they didn’t join the beta for other reasons."

Extrapolated out to a month, that’s roughly 400 million queries — up from 250 million queries in July.
Perplexity’s rapid rise comes as the company teases ecommerce features, including the ability for subscribers to its Perplexity Pro service to make one-click purchases. Perplexity is also reportedly planning a new ad model. According to The Financial Times, it’s in talks with brands including Nike and Marriott for sponsored queries.
One thorn in Perplexity’s side is its legal tussles with publishers. News Corp’s Dow Jones and the NY Post have sued Perplexity over what they describe as a “content kleptocracy.” Many other news sites have expressed concerns that Perplexity closely replicates their content — just last week, The New York Times sent the startup a cease and desist.
Perplexity is said to be in talks to raise around $500 million at an $8 billion valuation."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/elon-musk-reportedly-chats-often-with-putin/,Elon Musk reportedly chats regularly with Putin | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-25,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has been in regular contact with Russian president Vladimir Putin since late-2022.
That’s according to The Wall Street Journal, which reports that the conversations have raised national security concerns among some intelligence officials. At one point, Putin reportedly asked Musk to avoid activating Starlink, his satellite-based internet service, in Taiwan as a favor to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
As The WSJ notes, Musk and Russia’s interests have increasingly overlapped in the past year. Russia has used X, Musk’s social network, to mount disinformation campaigns, including about vice presidential candidate Tim Walz and the federal response to recent hurricanes. The Ukrainian government has said that Russian forces occupying the country have begun using Starlink to extend the range of their drones.
Sources tell The WSJ that the U.S. government faces a dilemma because it’s so dependent on Musk’s technologies. SpaceX, for instance, launches critical national security satellites into orbit."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/apple-adds-a-menu-in-ios-18-2-to-change-default-apps-including-messages-and-calls/,Apple adds a menu in iOS 18.2 to change default apps including messages and calls | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-25,"Apple released iOS 18.2 as a developer beta users earlier this week. While there was a bunch of AI goodie shipped with this version — including Gemmoji, Image Playground, and ChatGPT integration — the company also shipped a new default menu to change your default apps. And it’s not just limited to the web browser as you can change the default apps for messages and calls.
The company only allowed changes to the default email app and browser app until now. These settings were located in the Safari and Mail menus. With iOS 18.2, there will be a dedicated menu to change all default apps.
“Manage your default apps for iPhone, including choosing the apps you prefer to use for opening links on the web, sending emails, making contactless payments, and more,” the default app menu description reads.
Here is how you can access that:
The default app menu also lists the number of apps related to passwords & codes as well as keyboard apps that you have installed. If you tap on that menu, you can see a list of all these apps under these categories. You can also select the ones that you want to access while filling in passwords or typing in text.
Note that this option is currently available in iOS 18.2 developer beta users. Apple just released the first beta of iOS 18.2 this week. It’s going to take a few weeks before it’s available to download to everyone. We will update the story after it rolls out to a wider user base."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/screenables-app-turns-any-iphone-into-a-starter-phone-for-kids/,Screenable's app turns any iPhone into a starter phone for kids | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-25,"A new app called Screenable will help parents introduce their children to technology by turning an iPhone or iPad into a starter phone. The app is designed to grow over time with a child, as it offers different modes for kids of different ages.
For starters, the app’s “Dumb Phone” mode essentially turns an iPhone into a classic flip phone, as it only lets kids access the Phone, FaceTime, and Messages apps. While Screenable doesn’t let parents limit who their child talks to, they can use Apple’s parental controls to restrict their interactions to only include specific numbers.
With the Dumb Phone setting, parents can also choose to allow their kids to access other apps if they wish, especially as they grow older.
Screenable’s “Screen Trainer” mode is designed for kids who are starting to transition to independent use of an iPhone or iPad, as it uses a collaborative approach to parental controls. Kids can start using other apps, but parents will still be in the know about their child’s activities via notifications on their own devices that will inform them about the apps their child is using. Parents can also turn on an “Overtime” feature to let their kids practice staying within a specific daily screen time limit.
Soon, the app will offer a “Social Trainer” mode that will allow parents to slowly introduce their kids to social media. The mode lets parents give their children access to social media apps one at a time. While kids will be able to download any social media app that their parents allow them to, Screenable provides a custom install flow for Instagram, Snapchat, Discord, Facebook, BeReal, Tumblr, and Threads. The install flow lets parents set a time limit on the apps and also helps them set up the in-app parental controls for the different social networks.
If a parent wants to allow their child to use a social media app that’s not on this list, Screenable will encourage them to research the service before allowing their child to use it.
In addition, Screenable will provide conversation guides for parents to help them discuss online safety with their children when it comes to social networks.
Screenable is a family-founded startup, as it was created by brothers, Tom and Stevie Clifton, and their wives, Scarlet Clifton and Hannah Kwon. The group came up with the idea after they started thinking about how they were going to introduce technology to their children.
They looked at what was available on the market, and found that there wasn’t anything out there that worked for them. Tom and Stevie, who previously founded a cloud-based video maker startup called Animoto, decided to create a solution themselves alongside their wives.
“We are pro-technology,” Tom told TechCrunch. “A lot of the approaches of other apps out there are parents needing to lock everything down and not letting their kids have access to anything. And there’s probably some ages and stages where that’s appropriate, but ours is much more of a gradual program that helps them address each stage as they move towards device independence. We want to train our kids and make them able to use technology in a healthy way.”
That’s why the app is called “Screenable,” Tom explained, as the app is designed to help kids be able to use phones and be better equipped with technological knowledge.
Unlike some parental control tools and services that allow parents to monitor their children’s messages, Screenable’s approach isn’t about surveillance, Tom said.
Screenable operates on a freemium model that lets users access the app’s “Dumb Phone” mode for free because the startup believes that all parents should have access to the tool when first introducing their kids to technology. The app’s other modes can be accessed for a monthly fee of $7.
The group believes that Screenable will allow parents to make use of old smartphones that they may have lying around their homes when introducing their kids to phones, as opposed to going out and buying an entirely new smartphone.
In terms of the future, the startup believes that there is potential for the app to become a tool for families as a whole to disconnect from technology for a bit.
“We feel like there’s so many more interesting opportunities for bringing unique experiences into homes where families together can decide to turn their phones into ‘Dumb phones’ for the weekend or for a trip,” Tom said.
He noted that parents have been reaching out to ask if they can download Screenable on their own phones to cut back on their own phone usage, so the startup plans to launch this capability in the future.
While Tom and Stevie raised over $30 million for their first startup, they’re bootstrapping Screenable, as they want to keep the project small and grow it gradually on their own terms as a family."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/25/airdogs-founders-are-back-with-a-precision-strike-drone-meant-for-modern-warfare/,Airdog's founders are back with a precision-strike drone meant for modern warfare | TechCrunch,Mike Butcher,2024-10-25,"The war in Ukraine has shown that warfare changes by the day. It’s also clear that the tech used to make war today is costly: While larger countries can afford legions of tanks, helicopters, and precision-strike systems, smaller nations find themselves scrambling for cheaper ways to defend themselves.
Origin, a new defense tech startup out of Latvia, specializes in making reusable, autonomous drones that can deliver munitions far more cheaply than similar solutions. The company already has commercial agreements with two NATO countries, though these remain unnamed for security reasons.
Founded in 2022 by Agris Kipurs and Ilya Nevdah, Origin emerged after the pair exited Airdog, which made an autonomous drone that is famously used for recording extreme sports. Eventually, Airdog was acquired by U.S. smart home solutions developer Alarm.com.
“Airdog was a consumer drone. We were the first in the world to launch an autonomously flying system in 2015,” Kipurs (CEO) told TechCrunch. “We founded Origin in March of 2022, obviously in response to the invasion of Ukraine. We realized that we had to go back to doing what we do best, this time for military applications. We knew that the skill set that we have as a team is rare, as we’d been building autonomous systems for 10+ years.”
The startup’s flagship product, BEAK, is an ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) drone with precision guidance technology. It packs a camera, is capable of autonomous flight, and can withstand intense radio jamming. It’s also man-portable, making it well suited to wars like the one in Ukraine.
These days, many of us are familiar with images of ‘first-person view’ (FPV) drones, carrying grenades and slamming into tanks to blow them up. Clearly, these drones must be replaced.
Instead of blowing itself up, the BEAK delivers munitions to the target while remaining intact, meaning it can be reused — the cost savings can therefore be significant.
“The BEAK is a precision guided weapons system,” Kipurs explained. “It’s not a drone. Think of it as a flying Javelin. Drones are typically used for reconnaissance-type applications, not for delivering precision strikes. This is more like a traditional military drone, only it’s small, with the cost per strike approximately 20 times lower than the alternatives.”
Kipurs believes the BEAK will appeal to smaller countries: “Latvia and every small democracy across the world desperately needs the tech community to get behind the mission. They realize that they can no longer afford warfare the old-fashioned way.”
Origin recently raised €2.4 million in an early-stage funding round that was led by Change Ventures and saw Silicon Roundabout Ventures also investing. The company has also raised €1.6 million in EU grants and support from the Latvian Ministry of Defence, taking its total funding to €4 million.
Andris K. Berzins, a partner at Change Ventures, added in a statement: “Having known Agris and Ilya for a decade through their successful launch of the world’s leading action sports drone Airdog, I knew this team is unlike the many that have started learning how to build a drone startup only since the Ukraine invasion two years ago. Their ability to combine this expertise with an ambitious vision to reshape the precision weapons market, and their remarkable traction within the past 18 months, made investing in Origin an easy choice.”"

The company is partnering with Walmart-owned e-commerce service Flipkart and fashion retailer Myntra to open up their product catalogs to uploaders.
To be eligible for the affiliate program, creators must have their channels listed in the partner program and have at least 10,000 subscribers.
YouTube already allows select creators in India to list their own merchandise on their channels, and now creators can tag products they might be talking about in their videos, shorts and livestreams.
In the U.S., YouTube has launched multiple programs that are related to shopping and affiliate links over the last few years. In 2022, the video streaming service started testing affiliate links in Shorts, and in 2023, the company launched a feature to let creators tag products in bulk across their video library so they can monetize older videos.
YouTube in August expanded its partnership with Shopify to get creators access to thousands of more products. The company has also launched new features, like letting creators make shopping collections and a new affiliate hub.
“By making product discovery seamless across every format—from long-form videos and Shorts to live streams—and accessible on any device—mobile, web, and Connected TVs—we’re amplifying the impact creators can have and making it easier than ever for them to connect with their audiences,” the company said in a blog post.
The company said that India, YouTube’s biggest user base with over 400 million users, has more than 110,00 channels and over 100,00 subscribers, and since Shorts launched in India in 2020, users have viewed them over a trillion times.
Praanesh Bhuvaneswar, founder of influencer marketing platform Quroz, said this is a positive step for creators, but they should stay away from overselling products.
“It is evident that entertainment places are becoming stores, and this is a milestone event in the trend for Indian consumers and brands. This is great news for creators — especially of smaller size —who don’t get much spotlight from mainstream brands for partnership,” he told TechCrunch over email.
YouTube also has an active affiliate program for creators in South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam."

The update applies to controls like buttons, dialogs and sidebars that are more “modern and accessible,” the company said. Screenshots on the Google Workspace blog show that buttons and dialogs now have rounded edges, and the color schemes have gotten a touch up as well.
Google is also updating icons and typefaces across the Calendar UI to improve legibility and clarity.
The best part of this update (for me, at least) is support for dark mode. You can select from three options: Light mode, Dark mode, or Device Default.
Google added that these design updates will also apply to the task view list. The update is expected to roll out over the next few weeks."

Read the latest here.
OpenAI is reportedly planning to release its next frontier AI model, codenamed Orion inside the company, by December of this year, The Verge reported on Thursday. Unlike previous releases, the company reportedly plans to release the model gradually to trusted partners before a broader rollout through ChatGPT.
An OpenAI spokesperson tells TechCrunch the report is not accurate but would not elaborate further.
The Verge writes that Microsoft engineers expect to receive access to Orion as early as November, although it’s unclear what OpenAI will ultimately call the model. The o1 series of models was codenamed “strawberry” inside OpenAI for months before it was released.
There’s a lot riding on OpenAI’s next frontier model release. The AI startup just raised $6.6 billion in funding at a $157 billion valuation, and investors are expecting OpenAI to continue releasing increasingly capable models to lead the tech world."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/tiktok-accounts-are-becoming-divorce-fodder/,TikTok accounts are becoming divorce fodder | TechCrunch,Connie Loizos,2024-10-24,"When Kat and Mike Stickler divorced, their biggest challenge was dividing a shared TikTok account with millions of followers that generated significant income, and they aren’t alone, reports The WSJ. A growing number of couples — and divorce attorneys — are grappling with how to assess the value of social media accounts when a couple splits up, as well as who keeps what.
In her case, Kat Stickler won control of the couple’s TikTok account and her growing audience helped her buy a new condo; as for her husband, he got a shrinking YouTube account. He reportedly shifted to a sales career.
It may sound funny, but it’s no joke dividing these assets and establishing the potential for future growth, given that social media platforms can offer meaningful financial opportunities.
“My social media is my résumé,” influencer Vivian Tu told The WSJ. Tu, who posts about financial literacy, clearly takes the topic to heart. Before getting hitched in June, she wrote a prenup that listed her social media accounts."

The company, which was taken private again earlier this year for a sliver of its former value, has landed a new contract with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to support the development of a next-gen launch system for time-sensitive space missions.
The contract, which the DIU awarded under its Novel Responsive Space Delivery (NRSD) program, has a maximum value of $44 million. The money (however much of it is actually sent) will go toward the continued development of Astra’s Launch System 2, designed to perform rapid, ultra-low-cost launches.
The new funding is a sign that not everyone has lost faith in Astra, a startup that went public in 2021 at a $2.1 billion valuation with lofty ambitions of mass producing small, cheap rockets capable of executing hundreds of missions per year. But the company burned through cash as it struggled to materialize those statements, notching several failed launches (and two successful ones) before announcing the pivot to the 600-kilogram payload capacity Rocket 4.
The company spent a number of months searching — and failing to secure — enough financing to stay afloat on the public markets. The saga culminated in March when the company announced that the board had accepted an offer from co-founders Chris Kemp and Adam London to purchase the remaining Astra stock at a price of just $0.50 per share. Astra ceased trading on the Nasdaq in July.
DIU was evidently swayed by Astra’s proposal, however, and the new contract could help see Rocket 4 reach orbit for the first time. The goal of that launch, according to a document released by DIU last summer, would be to demonstrate one or more of these capabilities: delivery through space from one orbit to another; an orbital return from space to a precise location on Earth; or through a specific orbit or trajectory in space. Solutions should be flight-ready within 24 months, the document states.
Right now, Astra is in an initial phase of the contract to further refine its concept of operations, but if a prototype is selected, the company could progress to additional phases for one or more mission demonstrations. Later phases could include demonstrations with even larger payloads delivered with increased accuracy or trying to use the vehicle to support time-sensitive operations, like disaster response.
DIU has already issued two awards under the NRSD program, to the Spaceport Company for its planned mobile sea-based launch platform, and to Stoke Space, which is also aiming to make point-to-point space cargo delivery a reality."

Joby said it will use the proceeds from the raise — together with its existing cash — to fund its certification and manufacturing efforts, prepare for commercial launch in 2025, and for general working capital.
The eVTOL firm added that it intends to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional $30 million worth of shares of its common stock.
Joby plans to launch air taxis for urban transportation next year in New York City and Los Angeles alongside partners Delta Air Lines and Uber, as well as in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The startup also has a $131 million contract with the Department of Defense.
Before Joby can launch, it will need to complete its type certification process to ensure the design of its aircraft meets required safety and airworthiness standards.
The public offering comes as the Federal Aviation Administration this week cleared the way for eVTOLs to share U.S. airspace with helicopters and airplanes, and set up guidelines for eVTOL pilot training and operating rules. It also follows a $500 million injection from Joby’s existing investor Toyota earlier this month.
Joby has raised $2.6 billion to date, according to PitchBook data.
A spokesperson from Joby told TechCrunch the company could not comment on the raise.
This article has been updated to reflect Joby’s current contract amount with the DoD."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/how-the-ransomware-attack-at-change-healthcare-went-down-a-timeline/,How the ransomware attack at Change Healthcare went down: A timeline | TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,2024-10-24,"A ransomware attack earlier this year on UnitedHealth-owned health tech company Change Healthcare likely stands as one of the largest data breaches of U.S. health and medical data in history.
Months after the February data breach, a “substantial proportion of people living in America” are receiving notice by mail that their personal and health information was stolen by cybercriminals during the cyberattack on Change Healthcare. At least 100 million people are now known to be affected by the breach.
Change Healthcare processes billing and insurance for hundreds of thousands of hospitals, pharmacies and medical practices across the U.S. healthcare sector. As such, it collects and stores vast amounts of highly sensitive medical data on patients in the United States. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, Change became one of the largest processors of U.S. health data, handling between one-third and one-half of all U.S. health transactions.
Here’s what has happened since the ransomware attack began.
It seemed like an ordinary Wednesday afternoon, until it wasn’t. The outage was sudden. On February 21, billing systems at doctors offices and healthcare practices stopped working, and insurance claims stopped processing. The status page on Change Healthcare’s website was flooded with outage notifications affecting every part of its business, and later that day the company confirmed it was “experiencing a network interruption related to a cyber security issue.” Clearly something had gone very wrong.
It turns out that Change Healthcare invoked its security protocols and shut down its entire network to isolate intruders it found in its systems. That meant sudden and widespread outages across the healthcare sector that relies on a handful of companies — like Change Healthcare — to handle healthcare insurance and billing claims for vast swathes of the United States. It was later determined that the hackers initially broke into the company’s systems over a week earlier, on or around February 12.
After initially (and incorrectly) attributing the intrusion to hackers working for a government or nation-state, UnitedHealth later said on February 29 that the cyberattack was in fact the work of a ransomware gang. UnitedHealth said the gang “represented itself to us as ALPHV/BlackCat,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch at the time. A dark web leak site associated with the ALPHV/BlackCat gang also took credit for the attack, claiming to have stolen millions of Americans’ sensitive health and patient information, giving the first indication of how many individuals this incident had affected.
ALPHV (aka BlackCat) is a known Russian-speaking ransomware-as-a-service gang. Its affiliates — contractors who work for the gang — break into victim networks and deploy malware developed by ALPHV/BlackCat’s leaders, who take a cut of the profits collected from the ransoms collected from victims to get their files back.
Knowing that the breach was caused by a ransomware gang changed the equation of the attack from the kind of hacking that governments do — sometimes to send a message to another government instead of publishing millions of people’s private information — to a breach caused by financially motivated cybercriminals, who are likely to employ an entirely different playbook to get their payday.
In early March, the ALPHV ransomware gang vanished. The gang’s leak site on the dark web, which weeks earlier took credit for the cyberattack, was replaced with a seizure notice claiming that U.K. and U.S. law enforcement took down the gang’s site. But both the FBI and U.K. authorities denied taking down the ransomware gang as they had attempted months earlier. All signs pointed to ALPHV running off with the ransom and pulling an “exit scam.”
In a posting, the ALPHV affiliate who carried out the hack on Change Healthcare claimed that the ALPHV leadership stole $22 million paid as a ransom and included a link to a single bitcoin transaction on March 3 as proof of their claim. But despite losing their share of the ransom payment, the affiliate said the stolen data is “still with us.” UnitedHealth had paid a ransom to hackers who left the data behind and disappeared.
Meanwhile, weeks into the cyberattack, outages were still ongoing with many unable to get their prescriptions filled or having to pay cash out of pocket. Military health insurance provider TriCare said “all military pharmacies worldwide” were affected as well.
The American Medical Association was saying there was little information from UnitedHealth and Change Healthcare about the ongoing outages, causing massive disruption that continued to ripple across the healthcare sector.
By March 13, Change Healthcare had received a “safe” copy of the stolen data that it had just days earlier paid $22 million for. This allowed Change to begin the process of poring through the dataset to determine whose information was stolen in the cyberattack, with the aim of notifying as many affected individuals as possible.
By late March, the U.S. government said it was upping its bounty for information on key leadership of ALPHV/BlackCat and its affiliates.
By offering $10 million to anyone who can identify or locate the individuals behind the gang, the U.S. government seemed to hope that one of the gang’s insiders would turn on their former leaders. It also could be seen as the U.S. realizing the threat of having a significant number of Americans’ health information potentially published online.
And then there were two — ransoms, that is. By mid-April, the aggrieved affiliate set up a new extortion racket called RansomHub, and since it still had the data that it stole from Change Healthcare, it demanded a second ransom from UnitedHealth. In doing so, RansomHub published a portion of the stolen files containing what appeared to be private and sensitive patient records as proof of their threat.
Ransomware gangs don’t just encrypt files; they also steal as much data as possible and threaten to publish the files if a ransom isn’t paid. This is known as “double extortion.” In some cases when the victim pays, the ransomware gang can extort the victim again — or, in others, extort the victim’s customers, known as “triple extortion.”
Now that UnitedHealth was willing to pay one ransom, there was a risk that the healthcare giant would be extorted again. It’s why law enforcement have long advocated against paying a ransom that allows criminals to profit from cyberattacks.
For the first time, UnitedHealth confirmed on April 22 — more than two months after the ransomware attack began — that there was a data breach and that it likely affects a “substantial proportion of people in America,” without saying how many millions of people that entails. UnitedHealth also confirmed it paid a ransom for the data but would not say how many ransoms it ultimately paid.
The company said that the stolen data includes highly sensitive information, including medical records and health information, diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging and care and treatment plans, and other personal information.
Given that Change Healthcare handles data on about one-third of everyone living in the United States, the data breach is likely to affect more than 100 million people at least. When reached by TechCrunch, a UnitedHealth spokesperson did not dispute the likely affected number but said that the company’s data review was ongoing.
Perhaps unsurprisingly when your company has had one of the biggest data breaches in recent history, its chief executive is bound to get called to testify before lawmakers.
That’s what happened with UnitedHealth Group (UHG) chief executive Andrew Witty, who on Capitol Hill admitted that the hackers broke into Change Healthcare’s systems using a single set password on a user account not protected with multi-factor authentication, a basic security feature that can prevent password reuse attacks by requiring a second code sent to that account holder’s phone.
One of the biggest data breaches in U.S. history was entirely preventable, was the key message. Witty said that the data breach was likely to affect about one-third of people living in America — in line with the company’s previous estimates that the breach affects around as many people that Change Healthcare processes healthcare claims for.
It took Change Healthcare until June 20 to begin formally notifying affected individuals that their information was stolen, as legally required under a law commonly known as HIPAA, likely delayed in part by the sheer size of the stolen dataset.
The company published a notice disclosing the data breach and said that it would begin notifying individuals it had identified in the “safe” copy of the stolen data. But Change said it “cannot confirm exactly” what data was stolen about each individual and that the information may vary from person to person. Change says it was posting the notice on its website, as it “may not have sufficient addresses for all affected individuals.”
The incident was so big and complex that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stepped in and said that affected healthcare providers, whose patients are ultimately affected by the breach, can ask UnitedHealth to notify affected patients on their behalf, an effort seen at lessening the burden on smaller providers whose finances were hit amid the ongoing outage.
The health tech giant confirmed in late June that it would begin notifying those whose healthcare data was stolen in its ransomware attack on a rolling basis. That process began in late July.
The letters going out to affected individuals will most likely come from Change Healthcare, if not the specific healthcare provider affected by the hack at Change. The letter confirms what kinds of data was stolen, including medical data and health insurance information, and claims and payment information, which Change said includes financial and banking information.
It took the health insurance giant more than eight months to announce, but it has now confirmed that the data breach affects more than 100 million individuals. The number of those affected is expected to rise, given some have received data breach notifications as recently as October. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported the updated number on its data breach portal on October 24.
As it stands, the data breach at Change Healthcare is now the largest digital theft of U.S. medical records, and one of the biggest data breaches in living history."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/lumen-orbit-closed-one-of-the-biggest-rounds-from-y-combinators-last-cohort/,Lumen Orbit closed one of the biggest rounds from Y Combinator's last cohort | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-10-24,"Lumen Orbit has closed an oversubscribed, eight-figure seed round of more than $10 million, a source familiar with the details told TechCrunch. That would make it one of the hottest deals, if not the hottest deal, of the most recent Y Combinator batch.
The Redmond, Washington-based startup is pursuing a moonshot idea to build a network of data centers in space that can scale to a gigawatt capacity and be used to train large AI models. Lumen Orbit declined to comment.
The company went through YC’s 2024 summer batch and garnered a significant amount of attention from VCs, multiple VCs told TechCrunch. This interest led to an extremely competitive deal process for the startup’s seed round.
While Lumen has a lofty mission, the company seems to be making notable progress already. It was founded earlier this year and is planning to launch its demonstrator satellite in 2025 in partnership with Nvidia’s Inception program.
It’s not surprising that a company looking to build data centers in space would garner a lot of interest. There’s such a big scramble to power AI that companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are inking deals with nuclear power plants. Data centers are expected to consume 9% of overall energy consumption in the U.S. by 2030.
Lumen isn’t the only company looking to solve the potential data center crisis, nor is it the only one looking to take the issue to the great beyond. Lonestar Data Holdings is another that has raised $5.8 million and plans to build data centers on the moon.
Venture capitalists recently told TechCrunch that regardless of the data center solution, customer adoption is likely going to be tough for these startups. Still, VCs love to bet on companies with original solutions to big problems.
Lumen was founded in January 2024 by Philip Johnston, CEO; Ezra Feilden, CTO; and Adi Oltean, chief engineer. The startup had previously raised a $2.4 million pre-seed round in March that was led by Nebular with participation from Everywhere Ventures, Tiny VC, and Sequoia among others."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/they-wish-this-technology-didnt-exist-perplexity-responds-to-news-corps-lawsuit/,'They wish this technology didn't exist': Perplexity responds to News Corp's lawsuit | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-10-24,"Perplexity shot back at media companies skeptical of AI’s benefits in a blog post Thursday, responding to News Corp’s lawsuit filed against the startup earlier this week. The lawsuit alleged Perplexity engaged in large-scale copyright violations against Dow Jones and the NY Post. Several other media organizations — including Forbes, The New York Times, and Wired — have made similar accusations against Perplexity.
“There are around three dozen lawsuits by media companies against generative AI tools. The common theme betrayed by those complaints collectively is that they wish this technology didn’t exist,” said the Perplexity team in the blog. “They prefer to live in a world where publicly reported facts are owned by corporations, and no one can do anything with those publicly reported facts without paying a toll.”
In just over 600 words, Perplexity makes several grandiose claims about the media industry but does little to back up those claims with facts or evidence, saying, “This is not the place to get into the weeds of it all.” That said, the overall tone represents a sharp change from how Perplexity has previously engaged with the media companies that power its AI search engine. In the post, Perplexity referenced an adversarial posture between the media and tech, calling this lawsuit “fundamentally shortsighted, unnecessary, and self defeating.”
Throughout the blog, Perplexity does not mention or address the central claim of the lawsuit: that Perplexity allegedly copies content at a massive scale from publishers, then competes with them for the same audience.
Perplexity instead asserts that media companies like News Corp wish AI tools didn’t exist, a claim that’s very hard to justify. News Corp is one of many media companies that has a multi-year partnership with OpenAI to display the work of its journalists within ChatGPT. Perplexity itself also works with several legacy media companies — including Time, Fortune, and Der Spiegel — in a revenue share program. The facts suggest that many media companies simply don’t like the deal Perplexity and other AI companies are offering.
Later on, the startup focuses on other claims mentioned in the lawsuit. The first point is that News Corp is misleading people by saying Perplexity regurgitates the full text of articles. Perplexity also says it responded to outreach from News Corp, even though the lawsuit alleges the startup didn’t.
Another point here is completely speculative: Perplexity suspects that News Corp won’t actually use the “salacious” examples cited in its complaint in the real case, suggesting these examples are somehow invalid. Obviously, we’ll have to wait until the case proceeds to see if that’s true.
While Perplexity’s public response is largely deflective, its court filings may paint a different and more detailed picture of the events and trends at play here."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/unitedhealth-change-healthcare-hacked-millions-health-records-ransomware/,"UnitedHealth says Change Healthcare hack affects over 100 million, the largest-ever US healthcare data breach | TechCrunch",Zack Whittaker,2024-10-24,"More than 100 million individuals had their private health information stolen during the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare in February, a cyberattack that caused months of unprecedented outages and widespread disruption across the U.S. healthcare sector.
This is the first time that UnitedHealth Group (UHG), the U.S. health insurance provider that owns the health tech company, has put a number of affected individuals to the data breach, after previously saying it anticipated the breach to include data on a “substantial proportion of people in America.”
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services first reported the updated number on its data breach portal on Thursday.
UHG spokesperson Tyler Mason said in a brief statement: “We continue to notify potentially impacted individuals as quickly as possible, on a rolling basis, given the volume and complexity of the data involved and the investigation is still in its final stages.”
The ransomware attack and data breach at Change Healthcare stands as the largest known digital theft of U.S. medical records, and one of the biggest data breaches in living history. The ramifications for the millions of Americans whose private medical information was irretrievably stolen are likely to be life lasting.
UHG began notifying affected individuals in late July, which continued through October.
The stolen data varies by individual, but Change previously confirmed that it includes personal information, such as names and addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses, and government identity documents, including Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and passport numbers. The stolen health data includes diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging and care and treatment plans, and health insurance information — as well as financial and banking information found in claims and payment data taken by the criminals.
Change Healthcare is one of the largest handlers of health, medical data, and patient records, as it processes patient insurance and billing across the U.S. healthcare sector, including thousands of hospitals, pharmacies, and medical practices. As such, Change handles huge amounts of health and medical-related information on around a third of all Americans, the company’s chief executive Andrew Witty told lawmakers in May.
The cyberattack became public on February 21 when Change Healthcare pulled much of its network offline to contain the intruders, causing immediate outages across the U.S. healthcare sector that relied on Change for handling patient insurance and billing.
UHG attributed the cyberattack to ALPHV/BlackCat, a Russian-speaking ransomware and extortion gang, which later took credit for the cyberattack.
The ransomware gang’s leaders later vanished after absconding with a $22 million ransom paid by the health insurance giant, stiffing the group’s contractors who carried out the hacking of Change Healthcare out of their new financial windfall. The contractors took the data they stole from Change Healthcare and formed a new group, which extorted a second ransom from UHG, while publishing a portion of the stolen files online in the process to prove their threat.
There is no evidence that the cybercriminals subsequently deleted the data. Other extortion gangs, including LockBit, have been shown to hoard stolen data, even after the victim pays and the criminals claim to have deleted the data.
In paying the ransom, Change obtained a copy of the stolen dataset, allowing the company to identify and notify the affected individuals whose information was found in the data.
Efforts by the U.S. government to catch the hackers behind ALPHV/BlackCat, one of the most prolific ransomware gangs today, have so far failed. The gang bounced back following a takedown operation in 2023 to seize the gang’s dark web leak site.
Months after the Change Healthcare breach, the U.S. State Department upped its reward for information on the whereabouts of the ALPHV/BlackCat cybercriminals to $10 million.
Portions of Change Healthcare’s network remain offline as the company continues to recover from the February cyberattack. Lawmakers are also investigating the breach and the effect on the millions of Americans whose health data was irreversibly stolen.
During a House hearing into the cyberattack in April, UnitedHealth’s CEO Witty confirmed that the cybercriminals broke into one of its employee systems using stolen credentials that were not protected with multi-factor authentication (MFA), a security feature that can help to protect against the misuse of password theft.
By gaining access to a critical internal system using only a stolen password, the ransomware gang was able to reach other parts of Change Healthcare’s network and deploy ransomware.
It’s unclear why the system was not protected with MFA, but this will likely remain a key part of the ongoing investigations by lawmakers and the government. Witty told lawmakers that the organization has since rolled out and now enforces MFA following the cyberattack.
Lawmakers homed in on how UHG handles so much data and generates so much revenue and failed at basic cybersecurity.
According to its 2023 full-year earnings report, UHG made $22 billion in profit on revenues of $371 billion. Witty made $23.5 million in executive compensation the same year.
While the lack of MFA was abused in this case, the sheer size and wealth of highly sensitive data that Change Healthcare collects and stores made it a target in itself, lawmakers said.
Change Healthcare merged with U.S. healthcare provider Optum in 2022 as part of a $7.8 billion deal by UnitedHealth Group. The deal brought the two healthcare giants under UHG and allowed Optum, which owns physician groups and provides tech and data to insurance companies and healthcare services, broad access to patient records handled by Change.
UnitedHealth Group collectively provides over 53 million U.S. customers with benefit plans and another 5 million outside of the United States, according to its latest full-year earnings report. Optum serves about 103 million U.S. customers.
The deal faced scrutiny by U.S. federal antitrust authorities, who sued to block UHG from buying Change Healthcare and merging it with Optum, arguing that UnitedHealth would get an unfair competitive advantage by gaining access to “about half of all Americans’ health insurance claims pass each year.” A judge ultimately approved the deal.
The Justice Department reportedly began cranking up its investigation into UHG and its potential anticompetitive practices in the months prior to the Change Healthcare hack.

The filing comes after a series of setbacks from the German company that was once a darling in the nascent industry of electric aircraft. Lilium, which was developing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft with speeds of up to 100 km/h, had raised more than $1 billion from investors before going public in 2021 on the Nasdaq Exchange via a reverse merger with a blank-check company, SPAC Qell.
Lilium had success landing a number of high-profile investors like Tencent and locking in customers, including an order for 100 electric jets from Saudi Arabia. And more recently it had powered up its first full-scale prototype. But the company was still years away from delivering its product.
In the meantime, it burned through cash and grappled with other challenges. In 2020, one of Lilium’s two prototypes burst into flames while maintenance was being carried out. While the model was close to being retired, Lilium paused testing on its the second, newer model until it could determine the cause of the accident with the first aircraft.
Lilium was trying to raise additional cash, including 50 million euros ($54 million) of loans from the German government, but lawmakers denied the request last week. Lilium said it had “received indication that the budget committee of the parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany will not approve a €50 million guarantee of a contemplated €100 million convertible loan.”The company said it has not been able to raise sufficient additional funds to continue the operations of its subsidiaries. Lilium said it will file for insolvency in the next few days under German law. This means Lilium will lose control of its subsidiaries, which includes Lilium eAircraft."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/apple-will-pay-security-researchers-up-to-1-million-to-hack-its-private-ai-cloud/,Apple will pay security researchers up to $1 million to hack its private AI cloud | TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,2024-10-24,"Ahead of the debut of Apple’s private AI cloud next week, dubbed Private Cloud Compute, the technology giant says it will pay security researchers up to $1 million to find vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of its private AI cloud.
In a post on Apple’s security blog, the company said it would pay up to the maximum $1 million bounty to anyone who reports exploits capable of remotely running malicious code on its Private Cloud Compute servers. Apple said it would also award researchers up to $250,000 for privately reporting exploits capable of extracting users’ sensitive information or the prompts that customers submit to the company’s private cloud.
Apple said it would “consider any security issue that has a significant impact” outside of a published category, including up to $150,000 for exploits capable of accessing sensitive user information from a privileged network position.
“We award maximum amounts for vulnerabilities that compromise user data and inference request data outside the [private cloud compute] trust boundary,” Apple said.
This is Apple’s latest logical extension of its bug bounty program, which offers hackers and security researchers financial rewards to privately report flaws and vulnerabilities that could be used to compromise its customers’ devices or accounts.
In recent years, Apple has opened up the security of its flagship iPhones by creating a special researcher-only iPhone designed for hacking, in an effort to improve the device’s security, which has been frequently targeted by spyware makers in recent years.
Apple revealed more about the security of its Private Cloud Computer service in a blog post, as well as its source code and documentation.
Apple bills its Private Cloud Compute as an online extension of its customers’ on-device AI model, dubbed Apple Intelligence, which can handle far heavier-lift AI tasks in a way that Apple says preserves the customers’ privacy."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/google-adds-new-disclosures-for-ai-photos-but-its-still-not-obvious-at-first-glance/,"Google adds new disclosures for AI photos, but it's still not obvious at first glance | TechCrunch",Maxwell Zeff,2024-10-24,"Starting next week, the Google Photos app will add a new disclosure for when a photo has been edited with one of its AI features, such as Magic Editor, Magic Eraser, and Zoom Enhance. When you click into a photo in Google Photos, there will now be a disclosure when you scroll to the bottom of the “Details” section, noting when a photo was “Edited with Google AI.”
Google says it’s introducing this disclosure to “further improve transparency,” however, it’s still not that obvious when a photo is edited by AI. There still won’t be visual watermarks within the frame of a picture indicating that a photo is AI-generated. If someone sees a photo edited by Google’s AI on social media, in a text message, or even while scrolling through their photos app, they won’t immediately see that the photo is synthetic.
Google announced the new disclosure for AI photos in a blog post on Thursday, a little over two months after Google unveiled its new Pixel 9 phones, which are jam-packed with these AI photo-editing features. The disclosures seem to be a response to the backlash Google received for widely distributing these AI tools without any visual watermarks that are easily readable by humans.
As for Best Take and Add Me — Google’s other new photo-editing features that don’t use generative AI — Google Photos will now also indicate those photos have been edited in their metadata, but not under the Details tab. Those features edit multiple photos together to appear as one clean image.
These new tags don’t exactly solve the main issue people have with Google’s AI editing features: the lack of visual watermarks in the frame of a photo (at least ones you can see at a glance) may help people not feel deceived, but Google doesn’t have them. We asked Google if it would consider adding visual watermarks to its images, and they didn’t rule it out.
“This work is not done,” said Google Photos’ communications manager, Michael Marconi, in an email to TechCrunch. “We’ll continue gathering feedback, enhancing and refining our safeguards, and evaluating additional solutions to add more transparency around generative AI edits.”
Every photo edited by Google AI already discloses that it’s edited by AI in the photo’s metadata. Now, there’s also an easier-to-find disclosure under the Details tab on Google Photos. But the problem is that most people don’t look at the metadata or details tab for photos they see on the internet. They just look and scroll away, without much further investigation.
To be fair, visual watermarks in the frame of an AI photo are not a perfect solution either. People can easily crop or edit these watermarks out, and then we’re back to square one.
The proliferation of Google’s AI image tools could increase the amount of synthetic content people view on the internet, making it harder to discern what’s real and what’s fake. The approach Google has taken, using metadata watermarks, relies on platforms to indicate to users that they’re viewing AI-generated content. Meta is already doing this on Facebook and Instagram, and Google says it plans to flag AI images in Search later this year. But other platforms have been slower to catch up."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/teslas-25000-ev-flip-flop-explained/,"Tesla's $25,000 EV flip-flop, explained | TechCrunch",Sean O'Kane,2024-10-24,"The idea of a $25,000 Tesla has persisted for years — in part, perhaps, because CEO Elon Musk said he was “very confident” the company could do it at an event in 2020.
But on Wednesday night, during Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, Musk said the idea of a $25,000 car with a steering wheel and pedals is “pointless,” and “silly.” He said he only wants to sell one car at that price: the “Cybercab” robotaxi he revealed a prototype of two weeks ago.
It was the latest in a long line of public and private flip-flopping from Musk, a process that has so muddied the waters about Tesla’s future product portfolio that some of his company’s most ardent supporters have confidently and wrongly proclaimed that the idea of a drivable $25,000 Tesla — with a steering wheel and pedals — never existed.
But it did. Here’s how we got here.
Musk surfaced the idea of a $25,000 Tesla in 2020 at the company’s so-called “Battery Day” event. It was a showcase of the new in-house battery cells Tesla was working on, which were larger and more energy dense. Those advancements were supposed to help drive down the cost of the most expensive piece of any EV, the battery pack. And they would enable Tesla to sell a car for $25,000, Musk said.
“I think probably three years from now we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle, that’s also fully autonomous,” he said.
You could take that one of two ways. Either he meant the car would be a robotaxi like the Cybercab, with no steering wheel or pedals. Or he was talking about a car with a wheel and pedals that, like he has promised about all other Teslas, would one day receive a software update that made it autonomous. For what it’s worth, Musk reportedly was unsure about whether it would or wouldn’t be manually drivable in a September 2021 meeting.
But it’s not worth spending time arguing what exactly Musk meant. Because his own biographer found out.
Musk announced in January 2022 that Tesla was “not currently working on the $25,000 car,” saying at the time that Tesla still planned to do it, but that the company had too much on its plate. He also said that making Tesla’s cars autonomous was more important than designing a car for that price point.
Musk’s biographer, Walter Isaacson, found out what happened next. In his biography, Isaacson describes that Musk and his top lieutenants spent months hashing out whether to pursue the robotaxi idea, or a more traditional car.
Isaacson describes Tesla’s chief designer Franz von Holzhausen trying to convince Musk in an August 2022 meeting that making a car with no steering wheel or pedals was risky if the company couldn’t get its Full Self-Driving software ready in time.
“He suggested that they make a car that had a steering wheel and pedals that could be easily removed,” Isaacson wrote of von Holzhausen’s pitch. Here’s what followed:
“No,” Musk said. “No. NO.” There was a long pause. “No mirrors, no pedals, no steering wheel. This is me taking responsibility for this decision.”The executives sitting around the table hesitated. “Uh, we will come back to you on that,” one said.Musk got into one of his very cold moods. “Let me be clear,” he said slowly. “This vehicle must be designed as a clean Robotaxi. We’re going to take that risk. It’s my fault if it f—s up. But we are not going to design some sort of amphibian frog that’s a halfway car. We are all in on autonomy.”
But von Holzhausen and Tesla engineering VP Lars Moravy did not drop the idea of a manually drivable car — if only because they saw it as a hedge to the risk that Tesla would either be slow to get the software right, or that it would run into regulatory red tape.
So they kept working on the more traditional design in secret.
In September 2022, according to Isaacson, von Holzhausen and Moravy convinced Musk that the right approach was to develop both vehicles. Musk was initially not thrilled, as Isaacson tells it. But by February 2023, when von Holzhausen showed Musk models of “the Robotaxi and the $25,000 car next to each other in the studio,” Musk “loved the designs.”
“The new mass-market vehicle, both with a steering wheel and as a Robotaxi, became known as ‘the next generation platform,’” Isaacson wrote.
The idea that Tesla was building two different vehicles on this next-generation platform held for about a year, until Reuters published a bombshell story in April 2024: Tesla had scrapped plans to build a manually operable $25,000 car in favor of just pursuing the robotaxi.
It appeared Musk had flipped again. In response, he claimed — without offering proof — that Reuters was “lying.” But a few weeks later when Tesla released its quarterly results, the company tacitly admitted the report was right.
Tesla confirmed in that quarter’s shareholder letter that it was still pursuing a robotaxi design. But it also said it was working on “new vehicles, including more affordable models” that would “utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.” This is a very different plan from the $25,000 car that Musk approved in February 2023, according to Isaacson.
To this day, the company has not explained what these new models will look like. Some have speculated that Tesla is developing even-more-pared-down versions of the Model 3 and Model Y. What seems clear from subsequent earnings releases is that Tesla is accomplishing those further cost reductions by using ideas from the next-generation platform — ideas that were meant for the $25,000 car that was going to be built on that platform — and building them on existing production lines.
How low is Tesla trying to go with those cost reductions? The company hasn’t said, and it no longer has a public relations department. The Model 3 currently starts at around $42,000. Musk now says a $25,000 car is “silly” and “pointless.” Maybe finally delivering a car at the long-promised $35,000 price tag that the Model 3 was supposed to sell at is a more serious idea.
Whatever the answer winds up being, just remember this the next time anyone questions it: Tesla really was at one point working on a $25,000 car with a steering wheel and pedals."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/zero-motorcycles-is-raising-120-million/,Zero Motorcycles is raising $120 million | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-24,"Electric motorcycle company Zero is in the process of closing a new funding round for a little bit more than $120 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The filing shows that Zero has sold around $100 million of the equity round so far from two undisclosed investors. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s raising the money and that it will be used for expansion and to fund new models, but it declined to offer further specifics.
It’s Zero’s first funding round since the company raised $107 million in 2022 from Polaris and India’s Hero MotoCorp. The company said at the time that it had “all the necessary resources to continue pushing the boundaries of two-wheeled EV’s and electric powertrains.” The company — which is nearly 20 years old — typically refreshes its models every year, though it has been rumored to be working on a mini-bike.
Zero’s raise comes amid some rough waters for electric motorcycle companies. One of the largest, Italy’s Energica, filed for bankruptcy earlier this month after slashing its workforce by 70%. Design-forward e-moto startup Cake filed for bankruptcy in February, though it has emerged with a new owner. Smaller players like Fuell and Sondors have also gone out of business.
Meanwhile, Harley-Davidson’s electric motorcycle spinout Livewire continues to lose money on its own bikes. The company reported on Thursday that it lost $22.7 million in the third quarter and sold just 99 electric motorcycles. Livewire continues to generate more revenue from sales of its electric balance bikes for kids. Those brought in $3.2 million in Q3 versus just $1.2 million from the motorcycles."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/bluesky-raises-15m-series-a-plans-to-launch-subscriptions/,"Bluesky raises $15M Series A, plans to launch subscriptions | TechCrunch",Amanda Silberling,2024-10-24,"Decentralized social app Bluesky announced on Thursday that it has raised a $15 million Series A round, following its $8 million seed raise last year. This funding comes as Bluesky sees increased growth, in part from X users who are troubled by recent changes to the block feature, as well as the move to allow third parties to train AI on users’ public posts. Within the last month alone, Bluesky has added around 3 million new users, bringing its total user base to about 13 million.
Bluesky was initially incubated inside Twitter as former CEO Jack Dorsey’s vision for what the future of social media should look like. But the social network and developer of the open source AT Protocol is no longer affiliated with Dorsey, who left the startup’s board earlier this year. Still, many of the initial goals for Bluesky remain consistent: like Mastodon, Bluesky’s AT Protocol is decentralized, meaning that individual people will be able to set up their own social servers and apps, and people outside of the company have transparency into how and what is being developed.
“With this fundraise, we will continue supporting and growing Bluesky’s community, investing in Trust and Safety, and supporting the ATmosphere developer ecosystem,” Bluesky’s blog announcement reads. “In addition, we will begin developing a subscription model for features like higher quality video uploads or profile customizations like colors and avatar frames.”
The Bluesky team has been quick to tell users that this paid tier will not be like X, where subscribers get exclusive blue check marks and algorithmic up-ranking, making their posts more visible.
“The way twitter did subscriptions was basically a blueprint for how bluesky shouldn’t do them,” Bluesky developer Paul Frazee posted. “‘Pay to win’ features like getting visibility or having a bluecheck because youre a subscriber is just wrong, and ruins the network for everyone.”
The Series A round is led by Blockchain Capital with participation from Alumni Ventures, True Ventures, SevenX, Darkmode’s Amir Shevat, and Kubernetes co-creator Joe Beda. The presence of a crypto-focused firm might alarm skeptics, especially since CEO Jay Graber used to be a software engineer for a crypto company, Zcash, but Bluesky has proactively assured users that the company is not pivoting to web3.
“Our lead, Blockchain Capital, shares our philosophy that technology should serve the user, not the reverse — the technology being used should never come at the expense of the user experience,” Bluesky said in its announcement. “This does not change the fact that the Bluesky app and the AT Protocol do not use blockchains or cryptocurrency, and we will not hyperfinancialize the social experience (through tokens, crypto trading, NFTs, etc.)”
Graber also announced that Kinjal Shah, a general partner at Blockchain Capital, will be joining the board of Bluesky.
“[Shah] shares our vision for a social media ecosystem that empowers users and supports developer freedom, and it’s been a great experience working with her. With her support, we are well positioned to grow,” Graber wrote."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/here-is-notions-email-client/,Here is Notion's email client | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-10-24,"Notion, as my colleagues at TechCrunch scooped earlier Thursday, is announcing an email client at its first “Make with Notion” user conference. For now, Notion Mail is in preview, and at least for the time being, it’s more of a Gmail client than a traditional email service. The idea here, Notion says, is to build an email experience that allows users “to ditch the old ways of a rigid inbox and embrace a new way: where email works for you and your workflows.”
When exactly Notion Mail will launch, though, is still a question mark. The company is only committing to “soon” at this point, but there is a waitlist for getting early access.
With adding Mail, Notion (which says it now has over 100 million users) continues on its path to offering a more fully featured suite of productivity options. The launch of Notion Mail, after all, comes only a few months after the company launched its Calendar product. Notion Calendar, it’s worth noting, was the product of an acquisition, with the company buying calendar app Cron in 2022.
Similarly, Notion recently acquired Skiff, a security-centric platform that also included an end-to-end encrypted email service. It doesn’t come as a surprise, then, that Notion Mail is taking some design cues from Skiff, but the company’s focus here isn’t so much on security (though I’m sure that’s top of mind for Notion as well) but an integration with Notion AI.
There seem to be two parts to the AI integration here: automatically organizing your emails by using an AI prompt as a kind of smart filtering mechanism (think “label all recruiting emails by stage and show the role”), as well as the ability to let “Notion AI handle the tedious back-and-forth such as scheduling and follow-ups,” the company said. How well that works in practice remains to be seen.
One nice feature Notion Mail will offer that I often wish Gmail would is that it doesn’t just allow for using different filters, but also allows you to prioritize emails inside of those filtered views. Gmail, on the other hand, only offers the “priority inbox” view in the main inbox, but when you drill down to any of its default categories like forums, updates, or social, your only option is a reverse timeline view.
Another integration worth highlighting is with Notion Calendar. Users will be able to add a scheduling button to their emails that links them right to their calendars and availability.
In addition to Mail, Notion is also launching a number of other new features. These include Notion Forms, which lets users design forms and collect information, with Notion as the database backing it, as well as the ability to more easily customize layouts in Notion to better suit a user’s preference for how to display tasks, notes, docs, and more.
Notion is also launching some improved automation features, including the ability to connect Notion and Gmail to, for example, notify people via Gmail. And, to round all of this out, Notion has updated its Marketplace with a redesigned web experience."

Tesla released its Q3 earnings, and there were a few takeaways worth noting, beyond the straight revenue ($25.2 billion) and profit ($2.2 billion). For instance, the Cybertruck, which has been a polarizing vehicle, still managed to become the third bestselling EV in the United States.
Also, the company’s energy business continues to expand; Supercharger stations continue to grow (20% YoY), but at a slower pace than in previous quarters; and CEO Elon Musk noted that Tesla employees in the Bay Area have been able to hail autonomously operated Tesla vehicles via a prototype ride-hailing app. One thing to note, though: Safety drivers are behind the wheel.
I am highly skeptical of the timeline that Musk laid out, but for the record he said the company will “have driverless Teslas doing paid rides next year, sometime next year” in California and Texas.
“I mean, I’d be shocked if we don’t get approved next year, but it’s just not something we totally control. But I think we will get approval next year in California and Texas, and towards the end of the area will branch out beyond California, Texas,” Musk said during the earnings call.
The Federal Aviation Administration published a ruling that clears the path for electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft to share U.S. airspace with planes and helicopters. This is a big win for the industry and specifically for startups like Joby and Archer.
Wisk Aero signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Airservices Australia, a government-owned organization that provides air traffic management and associated services in Australia. The MoU lays the foundation for incorporating safe, autonomous air taxi travel into Australia’s airspace, according to the two companies.
Lyft is working on a “service animal opt-in feature” for passengers.
Yup, nothing this week, as I was traveling. But we do have a few EVs and e-bikes in the queue, including more time in the next-gen Rivian R1S.
What is “This week’s wheels”? It’s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we’re testing, whether it’s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike, or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/native-unions-clever-little-combo-charger-just-earned-a-spot-in-my-travel-bag/,Native Union’s clever little combo charger just earned a spot in my travel bag | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-24,"I love a clever gadget almost as much as I love saving space in my carry on. Native Union’s new Voyage charger handily ticks both boxes. It’s an unassuming puck-shaped product that’s easily stashed in a pocket or bag when folded shut.
Open it up, and you get a pair of Qi2 chargers. One side is designed for MagSafe iPhones, and the other features a familiar Apple Watch charging connector. The Voyage will lay flat in this configuration, so you can snap a phone and either an Apple Watch or wireless charging compatible AirPods case on the other.
Depending on whether or not your Watch band can be opened flat or is a loop, this positioning can be a little awkward. Thankfully, the watch connector flips up, allowing you to charge the smartwatch on its side like such:
If you need an additional option, the charger’s exterior sides also magnetically snap together, allowing you to charge both the phone and watch on their sides. This may well be the best configuration of the bunch, as it pulls up the iPhone’s Standby mode, thus replacing the need for a bedside alarm:
The Voyage is pricey for a charger, as one might expect from a product with the word “Paris” etched onto the front. Plenty of folks will understandably balk at paying $100 for an iPhone travel charger, even one that ships with a woven USB-C cable and a travel bag.
If it were entirely up to me, I’d cram a third charger into the thing, so I could replace the funky little MagGo Wireless Charging Station outright. Of course, Anker’s product is an additional $10 and considerably thicker.
For the sake of paring down my carry-on luggage as much as possible, I’m OK with the Voyage’s tradeoff. And hey, Native Union has to save some tricks for the Voyage 2."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg-is-joining-techcrunch-disrupt-2024/,WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg joining Disrupt 2024 | TechCrunch,TechCrunch Events,2024-10-24,"We’re excited to announce that Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of the popular blogging platform WordPress, will be taking the Disrupt Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024.
When Mullenweg first started working on WordPress, he was a 19-year-old jazz enthusiast and photographer in Texas who noticed the blogging software that he used had been stagnating — so he decided to build his own open source platform, forked from an existing project.
The first version of WordPress was launched in May 2003. From those modest beginnings, it has expanded to become a nearly ubiquitous content management system powering many of the web’s best-known publishers, including TechCrunch. By some counts, it’s used by more than 40% of websites.
Mullenweg also serves as CEO of Automattic, which offers hosting and other commercial services on top of WordPress and was valued at $7.5 billion in 2021. Among other things, Automattic operates the spam filtering Akismet, the e-commerce plugin WooCommerce, and the blogging platform Tumblr (acquired from Verizon). And if that wasn’t enough, Mullenweg also invests in startups through Audrey Capital.
As WordPress and Automattic have grown, and as Mullenweg has become one of the leading voices in open source software, they’ve also faced their share of controversies. For example, they’ve struggled to turn Tumblr into a sustainable business, and in recent months they’ve been locked in a legal battle with another WordPress-hosting company, WP Engine.
So there will be plenty to discuss with Mullenweg on the Disrupt Stage at Disrupt 2024 — about his founder journey, his challenges, and what’s next for WordPress and the web — when he joins us next week. It’s a conversation you won’t want to miss!

The news comes days after CEO Tim Cook admitted in an interview that the $3,500 mixed-reality headset is for early adopters and “not a mass-market product.”
The production slowdown is believed to be a response to disappointing sales, leaving Apple with plenty of inventory to match current demand. Estimates over the summer suggested that Apple will not hit 500,000 sales in 2024.
A new report earlier this month fueled further speculation that the company is planning to release a less expensive model in 2025. Priced at around $2,000, the headset would ditch the Vision Pro’s faster processor and more premium build materials."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/medtech-alimetry-gases-up-with-18-million-for-a-wearable-to-help-diagnose-gastric-disorders/,Medtech Alimetry gases up with $18M for a wearable to help diagnose gastric disorders | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-24,"Gut health isn’t the most glamorous of topics, but as many as 1 in 10 people regularly suffer from gastric symptoms like nausea, bloating, or cramping after eating. Figuring out exactly what’s causing stomach misery is not easy without invasive tests. But New Zealand-based startup Alimetry has developed a wearable device that can speed up diagnosis of functional gastric issues.
The noninvasive wearable consists of a flexible electrode array that’s applied to the patient’s stomach where it’s able to pick up electrical activity produced by their gut. Cloud-based analysis — including the use of artificial intelligence to help extract signal from digestive noise — turns the captured data into useful clinical biomarkers to support patient diagnosis.
The startup has just taken in a second tranche of Series A funding — $18 million, led by VC firm GD1 — on top of roughly $10 million it pulled in through an earlier Series A raise in 2021. It also raised seed funding back in 2019 the year it was founded.
“It’s much like the heart; the gut runs on a natural electricity, and that electricity causes it to move,” explains co-founder and CEO Dr. Greg O’Grady. “Those electrical rhythms and currents are really weak. They’re about 100 times weaker than the heart, which makes it really difficult to detect them.
“People have known about them for a long time, but no one’s been able to get at it reliably for clinical use — unlike the heart, which is obviously very mature and a huge industry now — and so the secret to cracking it has been taking a really high-resolution approach. And it’s only really been recently, through advances in stretchable electronics, wearables, and in AI, that we have really cracked the code to make this possible.”
To use the device, a patient attends a clinic where Alimetry’s device is applied and a benchmark recording of their gut activity is taken. They remain in situ while they consume a light meal still wearing the device, allowing data to be captured as their stomach works. The patient also logs any symptoms they experience in Alimetry’s app during the test.
The entire session (from benchmark to active gut recording) lasts a few hours, after which the device is removed, and Alimetry’s analysis of the data is sent to their doctor as a downloadable report to support diagnosis.
O’Grady says the data it presents enables clinicians to determine which phenotypes (or descriptive categories) apply to their patient’s condition to help personalize treatment.
“One of the main things we can do, for example, that’s unique to what we do, is we can diagnose whether a patient has a true gastric neuromuscular disorder or not, and completely noninvasively,” he tells TechCrunch, saying this is a major advance for diagnostics of functional gastric complaints.
The startup is using a “very high density” array of 64 electrodes to dial up its ability to capture stomach activity. The array itself is a single-use device but another component of Alimetry’s product (the reader) can be cleaned and reused after each patient use.
Alimetry’s business model entails selling the hardware to hospitals. Currently it does not have any software or licensing fees on top of that, but that may change as it continues to develop the product and add more features.
Alimetry has been testing its “gastric alimetry” wearable with more than 30 hospitals in the U.S. market, the U.K., and New Zealand for several years. It’s also obtained four clearances from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for the device to be used as a diagnostic aid; the company will be applying for more approvals as it continues to evolve the product.
The startup thinks its technology could have additional uses to support diagnostics in pediatrics and for issues affecting the colon. But its first product is focused on stomach complaints. “It’s a brand-new class of technologies, and we’ve been developing it really fast,” O’Grady says, adding: “As we discover new features, we put them through the FDA as soon as possible, then make them into the product. And we’re definitely not done.”
He says the (recent) addition of AI-based data processing has greatly enhanced its ability to pluck useful signal from gastric noise.
“We had a huge number of algorithms that would filter and process and analyze that data and present it to the clinician, and it only became possible once we’d done that a few thousand times that we could use the AI,” he says. “And it’s dramatically impressive how superior [it is] — we thought our algorithms were already excellent, but it’s really been, you know, almost surprising how dramatically superior they are at eliminating noise through that training process. But it required a very large dataset [before we could train neural networks].”
The version of the product that incorporates AI will be submitted to the FDA for approval next quarter, per O’Grady.
While Alimetry’s wearable could be a boon for diagnosis of functional gastric disorders, like chronic nausea, O’Grady confirms that this noninvasive “body surface gastric mapping” approach is not going to be able to help with chasing down the cause of every type of gut health issue. But it could still help doctors narrow down the list of potential causes of stomach complaints.
“We don’t have all of the answers within that category,” he says. “For example, we don’t detect things like the microbiome and influences that can have and immune reactions and so on. And so there’s always going to be a range of patients who require other testing.”
“That’s the way it is with the gut,” he adds. “It’s a pretty complex system, but we know that there’s a very large number of patients within that functional group who we can significantly help.”
Asked whether Alimetry’s wearable technology could automate diagnosis of relevant health complaints in the future, O’Grady reckons it will be possible — although such a product would require a likely higher risk class of regulatory approval. For now, the device sits firmly in the clinician support category with human doctors in the loop.
The startup’s Series A2 funding will be used for the next stage of commercialization as it seeks to build on a controlled market release it started in 2022 by getting more hospitals regularly using its kit to support diagnosis of neuromuscular gut disorders, sensory disorders, and gut-brain disorders.
“We’re opening ourselves up to more hospitals,” he says, stressing that expanding access will be more gradual, rather than a big bang. “We work closely with the hospitals to make sure that the reimbursement billing is successful, and that requires quite a bit of effort at the moment. And once those barriers start to come down, then we will be spreading out — but we’ve got a reimbursement code that came through in July, a CPT III code, that’s specific to this device, and that’s going well.”
The U.S. market will remain the company’s main focus as it continues its commercialization journey, per O’Grady. Thus far, Alimetry has about 4,000 tests recorded — but the medtech will be hoping to build on that by reaching many more patients in the coming years.
Commenting on the device in a supporting statement, Dr. Bu’ Hayee, a professor of gastroenterology at King’s College London, said the wearable is “transforming how we approach patients with various gastric disorders,” adding: “It’s difficult not to get over-excited about this.”
Other investors in Alimetry’s A2 funding round are AGA Ventures (the fund of the American Gastroenterological Association), Icehouse Ventures, and Olympus Innovation Ventures, along with follow-on from existing investors."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/cafeteria-raises-3m-to-connect-brands-with-their-most-opinionated-customers-teens/,Cafeteria raises $3M to connect brands with their most opinionated customers: teens | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-24,"Brands often rely on scraping the web and monitoring social media to understand what customers are saying about them and get insights for product development. Cafeteria connects teens with brands they are interested in so they can provide feedback about strategy and product development.
The startup is launching an iOS app Thursday. Before Thursday’s launch, the startup tested the app in beta for three months, onboarding teens across 60 U.S. cities.
Cafeteria’s CEO is Rishi Malhotra, who was co-founder of India-based music streaming service Saavn (now JioSaavn) — which was acquired by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio in 2019 — and ex-CEO of Luminary Podcasts. The founding team also includes chief business officer Mark Silverstein, who was chief content officer at Luminary, and chief design officer Leeann Sheely, who was VP of design at both Luminary and JioSaavn.
The company has raised $3 million, led by Collaborative Fund and Imaginary Ventures, with additional participation by Bertelsmann and veteran music industry exec Guy Oseary, who has worked with Madonna and Red Hot Chili Peppers.
“Cafeteria operates in the consumer insights and market research industry, uniquely focusing on real-time, authentic feedback from teenagers. Distinguished by its zero-party data collection, customizable analytics, and strong leadership under CEO Rishi Malhotra, it provides brands with actionable and timely insights tailored to ‘Generation Teen,’” Andrew Montgomery, partner at Collaborative Fund, told TechCrunch over email.
Montgomery added that Cafeteria has a great product-market fit in the consumer insights market because it delivers authentic and actionable insights for brands directly from teenagers.
Once a teen joins the app, they will select the brands they are interested in. Cafeteria will then invite them to participate in surveys called Tables. Teens can provide answers via a text or voice.
Teens get paid anywhere between $5 and $20 for their insights, and they can transfer their balance to Venmo, PayPal, Cash App, or a bank account through Cafeteria’s integration with Dots, an API for payouts. Users must have a minimum of $10 in their Cafeteria wallet to transfer the balance.
The company said that on average, these Table sessions last five minutes. Cafeteria mentioned that teens give insights ranging from which celebrity Nike should work with — apparently, Adam Sandler is as popular as Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter — and how they would spend $100 at a mall.
Cafeteria currently has thousands of users who get onto the app through either referral or word of mouth. All users are put on a waitlist before being onboarded.
During onboarding, teens go through a lifestyle Table, where they are asked 20 to 25 questions about retail, shoes, food, music, their first car, banking, and more. They can also select eight brands that they love.
The company is also limiting the number of surveys or Tables teens get per month to three to five. Malhotra thinks that this activity for teens is more rewarding than scrolling social media, but the company doesn’t want them to become daily or weekly active users.
Cafeteria notes that all users’ identity information, such as names and emails, are hidden from the companies. Brands can only see gender, age, and zip code.
For users under 18, the company has an optional feature to include parents’ emails while signing up for the service, but it’s not enforced.
The startup has a moderation policy consisting of humans and AI. It monitors comments for disinformation and harmful content and flags the users if they find such input.
In its privacy policy, the startup notes that the services are not meant to be used by children under 14; if the company becomes aware of any underage user, they delete the data.
Cafeteria collates insights from teens and puts them into a dashboard called Albums, organized by category. These Albums have insights with titles like “Edikted, Zara, Adidas and Skims are breaking through as brands that teen girls want to try next” and “On average, teens say $314 is what they would pay to see their favorite artist.”
The startup has a basic $5,000-a-month plan for brands to access lifestyle Album insights and also look at cohort competitor insights. For $8,000 a month, brands can create two Tables with at least eight questions across a minimum of eight users. For additional surveys, brands need to pay $2,500 a month.
Malhotra said that Cafeteria has onboarded top brands for its initial phase, but he didn’t name any of them. He mentioned that the company has completed over 2,200 Tables with over 50,000 insights.
The company thinks that its core strength is in collecting unstructured data and creating insights out of it. “We are building large language models that put the insight data in context. We are training different models that help us make sense of a lot of data,” Malhotra said.
In the future, Cafeteria wants to make the brand engage better with teens and also offer a store credit or a percentage discount. The company is also building out the capacity for brands to run prompts against insight albums and search for different metrics."

Today, Anthropic launched a new analysis tool that helps Claude respond with what the company describes as “mathematically precise and reproducible answers.” With the tool enabled — it’s currently in preview — Claude can perform calculations and analyze data from files like spreadsheets and PDFs, rendering the results as interactive visualizations.
“Think of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post. “Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data — cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result.”
Anthropic gives a few examples of where this might be useful. For instance, a product manager could upload sales data and ask Claude for country-specific performance analysis, while an engineer could give Claude monthly financial data and have it create a dashboard highlighting key trends.
Claude could attempt these tasks before. But, because it lacked a mechanism to mathematically verify the results, the answers weren’t always incredibly accurate.
Google offers a comparable feature for its Gemini models called Code Execution, which lets the models generate and run Python code to learn iteratively from the results. OpenAI’s flagship models similarly can write and execute code via a capability that the company calls Advanced Data Analysis.
Anthropic’s analysis tool is available for all Claude users on the web as of Thursday. To turn it on, log into Claude.ai and click here."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/cheers-lets-you-play-matchmaker-with-friends/,Cheers lets you play matchmaker with friends | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-10-24,"The latest addition to the dating app scene is Cheers, a newly launched matchmaking app available to users in New York City. Founded by former Instagram engineer Sahil Ahuja, Cheers sets itself apart by offering friend-matchmaking and social posting features to facilitate new connections.
Cheers (where almost everybody knows your name) puts a twist on the familiar mechanics of dating apps. Users can swipe through profiles and engage in direct messaging, all while leveraging their existing friend network to play matchmaker, letting users swipe on behalf of their friends, share profiles, and ask for introductions, removing the awkwardness of meeting potential matches online.
Additionally, Cheers incorporates social media features such as photo sharing, letting users post as many images as they want, rather than being limited to the six or so photos that most dating apps allow. Ahuja believes that adding unlimited images, featured on an Instagram-style profile, will enhance the user experience, making the dating app more like a social platform. It also helps with the vetting process, since a potential match may be tagged in one of their friend’s photos.
Ahuja told TechCrunch, “I’ve talked to a lot of women who have felt that that’s actually something that is really beneficial for them because if they see people on there with a friend, it validates this is a legit person. They’re not sketchy. It’d be okay to go out with them in real life.”
Ahuja worked at Instagram for four years before venturing into the startup world to begin his web3 company, Soho, which was sold to Sound last year. It has always been his dream to build Cheers, but he wanted to work at Instagram first to enhance his skills. In a way, Instagram is its own dating app. More and more users have turned to the app to “slide into the DMs” of their latest crush.
The idea of a friend matchmaking app is not new. Tinder attempted this in 2023 with Tinder Matchmaker, and Bumble has its Recommend to a Friend feature. Startups like Loop and Wingman also operate on the same principle.
Although friend matchmaking isn’t new, Cheers reflects the changing behavior of online daters, who are gravitating toward making more authentic connections. What better way to guarantee they’ll find a decent match than by relying on close friends who know them best?
Unlike the distant connections users may follow on Instagram or Facebook, Cheers takes a more personal approach. It requires users to exclusively invite individuals from their contact list, emphasizing a more intentional way of connecting. By restricting users to viewing only three matches per day, the app promotes deliberate and purposeful dating interactions, putting the user’s experience at the forefront.
As many dating apps experiment with AI, Cheers is utilizing ChatGPT to suggest which photos to post and generate captions. It also uses AI to help users set up profiles. However, the app prohibits AI-generated profile images.
Currently, Ahuja is working alone on Cheers and is focused on improving the app before promoting it in new markets or hiring anyone. He plans to add paid features in the future but wants to wait until Cheers has reached 5,000 users.
The app has garnered 150 signups so far, and new users need an invitation from friends to join. It’s currently only available on iOS."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/concentric-helps-companies-keep-track-of-their-sensitive-data/,Concentric helps companies keep track of their sensitive data | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-24,"Enterprises have a data inventory problem. The amount of data they’re collecting and storing is increasing, and that data is being spread across disparate storage buckets. Yet many organizations rely on processes that essentially amount to pencil-and-paper methods for tracking data provenance. According to one survey, more than 50% of companies use Excel spreadsheets in their data privacy and compliance efforts.
Karthik Krishnan, Shankar Subramaniam, and Madhu Shashanka thought they might have the engineering chops to build something to make this easier for companies. The trio had cut their teeth in cybersecurity: Years ago, Subramaniam and Shashanka had recruited Krishnan as one of the first employees at their behavioral analytics startup, Niara.
A few years after Hewlett Packard acquired Niara, the trio began sketching out ideas for an enterprise data management tool. They envisioned a product that could catalog a company’s critical data — including information stored in infrequently accessed places — and automatically flag any data that’s at risk of compromise.
“We hoped to solve one of the most pressing data security challenges facing the modern enterprise,” Krishnan told TechCrunch. “That is: identifying and securing business-critical information within structured and unstructured data, stored on-premises or in the cloud, at scale.”
The trio built an MVP and founded Concentric AI to further develop and commercialize it. Today, Concentric has customers in industrial manufacturing, insurance, and higher education, including car insurance carrier Hagerty and DeVry University.
Krishnan explained how the tech works.
First, a customer links Concentric to its databases, data stores, email and messaging apps, and even generative AI chatbots such as Microsoft Copilot. Then Concentric uses AI to find sensitive data like passwords, private files, and audio and video recordings of meetings in those linked places.
Concentric then gives the customer recommendations on ways to better secure its data and adhere to compliance standards. It can also trace lineage, showing where a certain piece of data came from and how it’s being used.
“Operationalizing data security is a huge challenge,” Krishnan said. “With Concentric, customers can identify anomalous activity and remediate those issues to prevent data loss.”
But doesn’t monitoring all this company data present a huge security risk? What if Concentric gets hacked, or what if hackers try to intercept the data flowing between apps and Concentric’s platform?
Krishnan told me that Concentric doesn’t deal with raw data; instead, it creates semantic representations of the data and data categories. “Concentric AI products do not store sensitive user data,” he said.
Concentric isn’t alone in the data protection market, which could be worth over $500 billion by 2032, according to one estimate. The startup competes with Varonis, BigID, Netwrix, Spirion, Cyera, and Securiti, among other vendors.
Still, Krishnan said that Concentric’s client base is growing at a healthy clip: It has grown by 300% from a year earlier.
The continued burgeoning of the data organizations have to wrangle is no doubt contributing to the boom. In a Matillion poll, data professionals said that their company’s data volumes are growing by 63% per month on average.
“There’s an unprecedented demand for data security posture management globally,” Krishnan said.
San Mateo-based Concentric recently closed a $45 million Series B round co-led by Top Tier Capital Partners and HarbourVest, with participation from CyberFuture, Ballistic Ventures, Citi Ventures, Engineering Capital and Clear Ventures. The new round brings the company’s total capital raised to $67 million, and the fresh cash will be used to expand Concentric’s partner program and product portfolio as well as increase the company’s headcount to 125 people by 2025."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/this-new-uk-startup-is-building-classic-style-cars-with-a-modern-ev-twist/,This new UK startup is building classic-style cars with a modern EV twist | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-24,"When U.K. custom electric car creator RBW showed off its Roadster and GT models at Monterey Car Week this year, the vehicles stunned a lot of attendees, CEO Peter Swain recently told TechCrunch.
“We had four ‘wows,’ where people would go: ‘Wow, that’s beautiful. Wow, look at the interior. Wow, is it really brand new?’ And then they go: ‘Wow, is that all that costs?’” he said.
That might seem like a strange reaction to cars that start at $139,000. But Swain contends the price tag is competitive compared to the many EV conversions that are happening around the world. And since his company is building these new, from the ground up, he thinks it’s a bargain compared to other custom builds.
“We’re not extortionate, for a hand-built vehicle,” he said.
Now Swain and his team at RBW are starting a new effort to please more of those people who’ve said “wow” over the last few years.
On Thursday, they’re launching a company called Spirit EV. It’s a design, testing, and production company that describes itself as EV-as-a-service, with an artisan approach.
The idea is to take all the things they’ve learned in creating the RBW cars over the last few years and make that expertise available to other companies that want to build new, custom electric cars with classic styling. Dedicated sports or classic car builders who want to develop an EV can tap Spirit for help with specific components. Or if they want, they can outsource an entire design to Spirit.
It’s a business Swain said other companies have essentially been begging him to operate as he and his team developed the RBW cars. Swain said he’s always “had to say no, we’re too busy bringing our product to market,” noting it took “five years and 1,874 quality documents.”
Now, he said, he can take the work RBW was doing and apply it at greater scale. “I’ve spent 18 million bucks to get where I am, not just because we love our little sports cars, but we know the systems business,” he said.
While Spirit is based in the U.K. and will operate there, the group is also incorporating in the U.S. and plans to open a factory in Danville, Virginia, by February 2025. The effort, along with RBW, has received $18 million in total funding, with $10 million coming from from Meson Capital Partners.
It’s an idea that’s possible because the push to go electric has driven down the cost of batteries, motors, and other components, Meson Captial president (and RBW chairman) Ryan Morris told TechCrunch. That, mixed with the engineering and sourcing work RBW has done over the last few years, is why he believes Spirit would only need around $20 million of total investment to reach profitability — something he expects could happen out of the gate in 2025.
“If you look at an auto restoration shop that does a dozen cars per year, and they’re buying, like, a single part in the aftermarket for every build they do, our costs are going to be way lower than that because we’re buying hundreds of components,” he said.
Beyond cost, Morris said a key difference between Spirit’s approach and classic conversions is that the latter still requires a lot of care and upkeep. Building a classic-style car from the ground up theoretically means an owner won’t have to worry so much about maintenance — which in turn expands the market of potential buyers.
“I’ve got two kids, I work a lot, I’m busy. I don’t have time to fix my car every third time I drive it,” he said. “It’s like when people watch old movies, and they romanticize the past — but then if you actually were in the past, it’s like, ‘Oh the toilet paper was worse.’ The cars broke down all the time. There are so many little things that we take for granted.”
Spirit’s approach also means these classic-looking cars will have modern safety and convenience features, including Apple CarPlay.
Swain, meanwhile, is a believer not just because of the attention and success he’s found with RBW, but also because he’s hired people who’ve been working on EVs for longer than almost anyone else. In particular, he has a few workers leading the charge who spent time developing some of the earliest, most frustrating modern EVs.
For years, automakers dragged their feet on seriously developing electric vehicles. If they developed them at all, they were often denigrated as “compliance cars” — good enough to please regulators, but limited by the available technology and a depressing option for most consumers.
Neil Heslington, who’s leading development for Spirit, worked on some of these cars, including the Smart EV for Daimler in 2008. But while the OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) viewed them as “painful exercises,” he told TechCrunch those projects are directly informing the work at Spirit.
“We learned an awful lot of how we could do a small project to OEM standards, so that it was acceptable to go on the road, but with lower budgets and less time,” Heslington told TechCrunch in an interview.
Swain is confident in the idea, but he’s aware that with Spirit, his team is wading deeper into uncertainty than they have with RBW.
“We’re in a new market, which we’ve created. It’s pretty unique — brand-new, classic EV cars,” he said. “But where’s it going to go? Let’s be honest, we don’t know exactly. We think we know, because we’ve got people who already want the system, and we’ve sold over 300 cars, and we’ve got a big waiting list. So the signs are good. We’ve just got to keep pushing forward.”

The order urges keeping humans “in the loop” of AI tools that may be used as targeting weapons, and prohibits letting AI make decisions on granting asylum, tracking someone based on their ethnicity or religion, or classifying a person as a “known terrorist” without human review.
Beyond this, the memorandum calls for intelligence agencies to begin protecting work on AI and AI chips from spying or theft by foreign adversaries. It also empowers the recently established AI Safety Institute to help inspect AI tools before they are released to ensure that they can’t aid terrorist groups or hostile nations.
As The New York Times notes, it’s unclear how impactful the order will ultimately be, given most of the deadlines it sets will lapse after Biden leaves office."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/snapchat-brings-camera-shortcut-to-the-iphone-lock-screen/,Snapchat brings camera shortcut to the iPhone lock screen | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-24,"Users with iPhone iOS 18 and later can now replace the flashlight or native camera lock screen shortcut with the Snapchat camera. Once a picture is taken or video is recorded with the shortcut, users will have to unlock their phone before sharing.
Snapchat says more than 55,000 Snaps are created every second on average, and that through this integration, the app is making it easier to capture a moment as it happens.
To set up the integration, you need to tap and hold your iPhone’s lock screen and then select the “Customize” option and tap “Lock Screen.” From there, you tap on the controls at the bottom of your screen to remove the default options, before tapping the “plus” option to select the Snapchat Camera.
The company also revealed that you can customize the iPhone 16’s Camera Control button to open Snapchat and click it to capture moments quickly.
The changes announced today are Snapchat’s latest use of new iPhone features. For instance, the company launched customizable lock screen and home screen widgets with iOS 16, and the option to customize the Action button to instantly launch the Snapchat app with the iPhone 15.
In addition, Snapchat officially announced the launch of its new Footsteps feature, after quietly rolling it out a few weeks ago. The new feature, which was previously only available to Snapchat+ subscribers, uses Snap Map to let you see how much of the world you’ve explored and track where you’ve traveled.
Snapchat is also introducing more stickers and Halloween-themed AI lenses."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/uk-competition-regulator-to-investigate-alphabets-investment-in-anthropic/,UK competition regulator to investigate Alphabet’s investment in Anthropic | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-24,"The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is launching a formal probe into Alphabet’s investment in AI rival Anthropic.
The investigation comes three months after the CMA confirmed it was inviting “interested parties” to comment on Alphabet’s various investments in Anthropic, which includes a reported $300 million early last year followed by another reported $2 billion.
The probe being launched now is part of a multi-pronged investigation designed to tackle the so-called quasi-merger, which has seen Big Tech firms take a fresh approach to gaining control of innovative young startups by, for example, hiring startup founders and technical talent, as well as making strategic investments.
Beyond Alphabet’s own investments in Anthropic, the 3-year-old San Francisco startup has been courting other big-name investors, including Amazon, which has invested $4 billion in the startup. The CMA had been sniffing around that partnership, too, but last month it concluded that it couldn’t investigate the deal under current merger rules due to the size and scope of the deal.
The fact that the CMA has decided that Alphabet’s investment in the same startup does qualify as a “relevant merger situation” is telling. It suggests that the terms of Alphabet’s investment in Anthropic are different from those of Amazon’s, or that Alphabet’s deal will harm competition in a way that the Amazon partnership wouldn’t.
In a statement issued to TechCrunch, a spokesperson for Alphabet subsidiary Google said that “Anthropic is free to use multiple cloud providers and does, and we don’t demand exclusive tech rights.”
The CMA, meanwhile, said it has “sufficient information” regarding the partnership to begin an investigation before deciding whether to refer the case to a more in-depth “phase 2” investigation. This decision is expected by December 19, 2024.
An Anthropic spokesperson said that it intends to cooperate with the CMA.
“We are an independent company and none of our strategic partnerships or investor relationships diminish the independence of our corporate governance or our freedom to partner with others,” they said. “Anthropic’s independence is a core attribute — integral both to our public benefit mission and to serving our customers wherever and however they prefer to access Claude.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/notions-email-product-is-nearing-launch/,Notion’s email product is nearing launch | TechCrunch,"Sarah Perez, Ivan Mehta",2024-10-24,"Notion seems to be close to launching its email product called Notion Mail according to multiple sources.
Earlier this year, Notion acquired Skiff, a privacy-focused email service and app. At the time, Skiff said that it would provide a 12-month sunset window to users so that they have enough time to migrate to a different email service.
For months, users on Reddit have shared hints of Notion working on its email product. Some folks found the development environment URL, while others reportedly found the login page to the email product.
At the time of writing, when TechCrunch entered mail.notion.so in a web browser, “Notion Mail” appeared briefly as the page title with a mail logo … but we were then redirected to Notion’s main login page.
On mobile, the mail.notion.so URL redirects to notion.so/product/email … but the page displays an error message saying “Sorry, that page cannot be found.”
We reached out to Notion for a comment, but the company didn’t respond at the time of writing.
The company seems to be adding more products to its productivity suite to expand beyond its main knowledge base platform. Earlier this year, Notion launched a stand-alone calendar app based on its acquisition of Cron.
A secure email service on top of it would be another offering for Notion to attract more users and better compete with productivity suites from bigger tech companies, such as Google Workspace and Microsoft 365. Interestingly, Notion has an event today where the company is supposedly announcing new products."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/after-selling-anchor-to-spotify-co-founders-reunite-to-build-ai-educational-startup-oboe/,"After selling Anchor to Spotify, co-founders reunite to build AI educational startup Oboe | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-10-24,"The co-founders who sold their last startup to Spotify are working on a new project: an AI-powered educational startup called Oboe backed by a $4 million seed investment. The new company, hailing from Nir Zicherman and Michael Mignano, aims to democratize access to learning the way that their prior startup, Anchor, made it possible for anyone to create a podcast. That is, Oboe intends to produce a user-friendly interface that helps people accomplish the task at hand — in this case, expanding their knowledge via a combination of AI technology, audio, and video.
“This idea is something that Mike and I have been talking about for a long time now, because we have both felt for a while that there is a really big opportunity in the education space — much bigger than I think a lot of people realize,” Zicherman says.
After taking a brief period to recharge after leaving Spotify in October 2023, Zicherman was soon ready to roll up his sleeves and build something new with a small team, he says, similar to Anchor’s early days. He also took inspiration from his work at Spotify, where he had spent the last few years building out its audiobooks business and scaling it to more markets.
“One of the big things … that drew me to audiobooks, as a business, and as a product, was this idea of enabling so many more people than ever before to get access to incredible, high-quality content, including educational content and making that really ubiquitous,” he notes.
Oboe looks to expand on that mission, but not via audiobooks.
Instead, the team envisions a product that would allow more people to engage with “active learning journeys,” as the company calls it, by offering learning tools that optimize the development of a curriculum and personalize those to the way the individual user learns most effectively.
The tools offered will be available across platforms and will involve native applications, similar to existing online learning services.
However, the startup intends to differentiate itself from others in the space by leveraging AI to both customize the curriculum materials and enable an interactive experience. For instance, synthetic AI voices will be a part of the offering. Meanwhile, machine learning combined with Oboe’s back-end architecture will help to personalize how the material is presented and will improve over time.
Because AI tends to hallucinate or cite bad information, part of Oboe’s secret sauce will be focused on ensuring the content is accurate, high-quality, and scalable.
In part, Oboe will rely on third-party foundational AI models, but the team is also undertaking a “significant” amount of work in-house to build its data architecture and optimize the curriculum on a per-user basis, Zicherman says.
“This product is not one of these thin wrappers around existing LLMs. There’s a lot more happening under the hood,” he teases.
In addition, access to the material will be made available across different formats. When you can’t look at a screen — like if out for a jog or driving to work — you could tune in via audio. Other times, you may be watching videos, using an app, or engaging with a website.
Initially, Oboe will target just a few verticals, ranging from someone teaching themselves programming to a college student supplementing their classroom experience with more materials, for instance. These debut courses will focus on learners older than the K through 12 demographic, but Oboe’s eventual goal is to fulfill its mission of “making humanity smarter.” (A tall order, indeed.) That includes the K through 12 and higher-ed space, as well as those upskilling for their careers, or just engaged on their own to learn something new, like playing a new instrument. (Fun fact: Not only is the oboe the instrument an orchestra tunes to, but it’s also the root of the Japanese word meaning “to learn.”)
New York-based Oboe isn’t yet ready to share much more in terms of product details, but it has raised funding from a crowd of investors, including those who have worked with Zicherman and Mignano previously. Mignano will remain a full-time partner at Lightspeed but will serve on the board of this new company and support Zicherman in his role of CEO, he says.
“In my co-founding role at Oboe, Nir and I have worked closely together to set the company up for success through its initial strategy and product direction,” Mignano tells TechCrunch. “My partners at Lightspeed are super supportive of me being both investor and founder — there’s a long history of our investors starting or incubating their own companies. Nir and I were thrilled to raise this initial round from a number of amazing seed funds and angels — many who backed us previously at Anchor,” he adds.
Oboe’s $4 million seed round was led by Eniac Ventures — the VC firm that led Anchor’s seed. The round also includes investment from Haystack, Factorial Capital, Homebrew, Offline Ventures, Scott Belsky, Kayvon Beykpour, Nikita Bier, Tim Ferriss, and Matt Lieber."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/smashing-an-ai-powered-app-for-online-readers-launches-to-the-public/,"From Goodreads' founder, Smashing debuts its AI-powered app for online readers | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-10-24,"Smashing, a new app curating the best of the web from Goodreads co-founder Otis Chandler, is now available to the public. Like Goodreads, the app aims to create a community around content. But this time, instead of books, the focus is on web content — like news articles, blog posts, social media posts, podcasts, and more. In addition, Smashing is introducing an AI Questions feature that allows you to engage with the content being shared in different ways, including by viewing a news story from different perspectives or asking the AI to poke holes in the story, among other things.
By viewing different angles of a story, you can see how both the political left and right view the subject. Or, in the case of a company’s stock, you might be presented with both the bull and bear case.
There are a good handful of AI prompts available at launch, notes Chandler, and not all will make sense to use on every news story or piece of content. For instance, there’s a silly “make it funny” prompt, and others that can simplify the story, display a timeline, or introduce “unconventional” takes that may involve thinking outside the box, helping you weigh ideas you hadn’t considered yet. You can also ask your own questions, if you prefer.
“I’ve been having fun, for instance, asking it to write me a podcast script, and then plug that into Notebook LM, then listen to it in the car,” Chandler says.
On the app, users are able to create multiple interest feeds to stay informed about the topics that matter to them, like politics, investing, parenting, health and wellness, and more, or even narrower interests like specific companies, sports teams, crypto, climate change, or other subtopics.
The app also leverages AI to surface content from around the web and then match it to an individual reader based on what articles they tend to read, what subtopics they like, and what’s already popular in the community, as determined by upvotes and downvotes. Combined, the signals tune Smashing to a user’s particular interests.
As part of the AI Questions feature, Smashing is also introducing AI-powered Story Overview pages, which offer grouped articles, blog posts, and social media posts all about the same story.
Since announcing plans for Smashing this summer, the startup has signed up more than 2,000 people on its waitlist and has a few thousand or so testing the beta version. Since then, Chandler says, its AI algorithms have “vastly” improved, thanks to fine-tuning, a better user experience that lets readers mark if things are interesting or not, a larger community of curators, and overall improvements from the rapidly evolving LLM models available.
Smashing is initially available in iOS and has a web version in development. The startup is backed by $3.4 million in seed funding from True Ventures, Blockchange, Offline Ventures, Advancit Capital, Power of N Ventures, and a number of angel investors."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/uk-revives-plan-to-reform-data-protection-rules-with-an-eye-on-boosting-the-economy/,UK revives plan to reform data protection rules with an eye on boosting the economy | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-24,"A new data bill from the U.K. Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) aims to revive several measures that failed to pass under the prior government, while rowing back on some controversial post-Brexit reforms proposed by conservative ministers.
The government reckons the “Data (Use and Access) Bill” (DUA) stands to boost the U.K. economy by £10 billion by unlocking major public sector efficiency savings. These savings would result from streamlining the rules for sharing information across domains such as healthcare and law enforcement.
The legislation also concerns digital identity and verification, expanding “smart data schemes” (akin to open banking), mapping of underground infrastructure, digitizing the birth and death registry, and enabling access to data held by online platforms.
“With laws that help us to use data securely and effectively, this Bill will help us boost the U.K.’s economy, free up vital time for our front-line workers, and relieve people from unnecessary admin so that they can get on with their lives,” technology secretary Peter Kyle said in a statement.
Much of the bill seems to have been carried over from the conservative government’s planned data reforms — such as a plan to simplify cookie consent by letting sites process people’s data for analytics without consent. But one notable addition is a plan to force online service providers to retain information related to the deaths of minors using their services.
This looks to be a response to cases of parents facing lengthy fights to gain access to their children’s social media accounts following suicides.
Also notable is a provision to legislate to allow online safety researchers access to data. Here, the U.K. appears to be copying the European Union, as the bloc’s Digital Services Act mandates major platforms to facilitate researchers’ access to their data.
The U.K. has often lagged behind the EU on digital regulation, so tacking a data access provision on to the data bill looks like an attempt to catch up. It would also bolster the prospects of the Online Safety Act, which U.K. ministers finally passed last fall.
Elsewhere, the new bill rows back on some controversial changes the last government proposed for amending the country’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Ministers are likely keen to avoid failing the EU’s upcoming review (in 2025) of its adequacy decision that was granted in 2021. That decision allowed the data of any EU users that U.K. businesses held to continue flowing into the country for processing.
“The European Commission will be relieved that the Bill doesn’t take forward the Conservatives’ proposals to limit the application of ROPAs [record of processing activities], DPIAs [data protection impact assessments] and DPOs [data protection officers] or seek to undercut the independence of the ICO [Information Commissioner’s Office],” said Edward Machin, a senior lawyer in Ropes & Gray’s data, privacy, and cybersecurity practice.
“Its expansion of the GDPR’s provisions on legitimate interests and purpose limitation also aren’t likely to trouble the upcoming adequacy renewal process,” he added.
Digital rights organization Open Rights Group (ORG) had a less positive assessment of the revived bill, warning it “will fail to protect the public from AI harms.” ORG said the bill limits people’s rights over automated decisions that have a legal or significant effect on them to only special category data (not personal data).
“This means organisations can use automated decisions to make life-changing decisions — such as firing workers, calculating wages, deciding on visa and benefits applications,” ORG said. “It also gives the Secretary of State the right to outright exempt automated decision-making systems from data protection safeguards regardless of the risk they pose to the public.”
ORG also highlighted “new loopholes” that could weaken data rights by allowing companies to spin out responding to data requests by asking individuals for more information. And it warned the revived bill still allows for “data grabs of our personal information under the guise of ‘research.’”
“The Data Use and Access Bill weakens our rights and gives companies and organisations more powers to use automated decisions. This is of particular concern in areas of policing, welfare and immigration, where life-changing decisions could be made without human review,” said ORG’s legal and policy officer, Mariano delli Santi, in a statement.
ORG stressed that the revived bill still gives powers to the government that could undermine the independence of the ICO.
However, Richard Cumbley, a partner in law firm Linklaters’ technology, media and telecommunications division, flagged a change that would limit the ICO to a six-month period to wrap up fining investigations. That, he suggested, could tackle the problem of ICO probes being drawn out for years.
Also putting out an early take on the new government’s first bite at GDPR reform, Jon Baines, a senior data protection specialist at law firm Mishcon de Reya, highlighted planned changes to privacy notices that could be controversial.
“The DUA Bill proposes that the obligation to give a privacy notice to data subjects from whom data is directly collected will not apply to the extent that providing it ‘is impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort,’” he said in a blog post. He noted some of the examples given in the bill include “the number of data subjects, the age of the personal data and any appropriate safeguards applied to the processing.”
“Similar wording is proposed for the Article 14 case where personal data is collected but not directly from the data subject. It seems likely that if these clauses are enacted, the obligation on data controllers to notify data subjects of processing will be greatly reduced. Correspondingly, these clauses are likely to be highly controversial, and subject to parliamentary debate,” he added.
The bill also proposes amendments to the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), which regulates marketing communications and issues like requiring cookie consent.
“Pixel tracking and device finger-printing are clearly brought on to the same footing as cookies, restricting a perceived loophole widely used by online marketers to avoid cookie rules,” Linklater’s Cumbley told TechCrunch.
In his blog post, Mishcon de Reya’s Baines flagged the reappearance of the previous government’s proposal to permit the use of first-party cookies (and similar tracking technology) for website analytics without requiring users’ consent. He also noted the revival of a proposal to increase the potential fine for PECR infringements to U.K. GDPR levels (aka £17.5 million for the most serious infringements).
Baines also pointed to another change that could help the ICO crack down on senders of speculative spam. The bill would allow for spam that was not received by anyone to count as potentially offending communications, and therefore would be enforceable against."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/supply-chain-startup-interos-lands-new-customers-cash/,"Supply chain startup Interos lands new customers, cash | TechCrunch",Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-24,"Each year, supply chain disruptions cost the global economy trillions of dollars. In a recent McKinsey poll, nine in ten businesses said they had encountered logistics challenges over the past 12 months.
Headwinds have only grown stronger as chaos reigns in key shipping corridors. Attacks on freighters continue in the Red Sea. Flooding is disrupting automotive production in Europe. And trade tensions are choking the movement of manufacturing equipment to Southeast Asia.
Unsurprisingly, supply chain risk intelligence firms like Interos have had no trouble signing up customers lately. Early in the year, Interos inked large contracts with the Defense Department and Canada’s Coast Guard and Royal Navy. Speaking to TechCrunch this week, CEO Ted Krantz said the company’s revenue has grown 35% year-over-year.
“We are primed to accelerate adoption of our platform across the entire supply chain risk life cycle at a time when the supply chain ecosystem has never been more strategic and complex,” he added.
Launched in 2005, Interos maps and monitors organizations’ supply chains for potential regulatory, labor, and cybersecurity issues. The platform uses AI to uncover supplier and vendor relationships, scoring each supplier and vendor to generate a summary of the top potential risks.
Customers can funnel additional info from their internal business systems into Interos, including financial and contractual risk data. The company offers APIs for integrating data sources and systems for procurement, enterprise risk management, and information security.
Interos is the brainchild of Jennifer Bisceglie, who previously led government market efforts at supply chain solutions company Manhattan Associates. Bisceglie moved into the role as executive vice chair with Krantz’s appointment in April.
Today, Interos serves around 100 clients, including Google, NASA, the U.S. Navy, and defense contractor L3Harris.
That’s an impressive base. But the AI in supply chain market, which by one estimate was worth $5.05 billion in 2023, is chock-full of vendors going after the same customer segments.
There’s Pando, which is developing a suite of fulfillment management tech. AI-powered supply chain visibility platform Altana recently bagged $100 million. And I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention Augur, a newer supply chain venture spearheaded by ex-Amazon exec Dave Clark.
Interos hopes to stay ahead of the competition by aggressively expanding.
The company this month closed a $40 million strategic growth round from funds managed by Blue Owl Capital, which Krantz said will be spent on product development and broadening Interos’ AI capabilities.
“The investment from Blue Owl is a vote of confidence for our vision into AI-powered predictive analytics,” Krantz said.
To date, the Arlington, Virginia-based company has raised nearly $290 million in venture capital."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/ai-networking-startup-boardy-raises-3m-pre-seed/,AI networking startup Boardy raises $3M pre-seed | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-10-24,"Boardy, a professional networking startup driven by AI voice technology, announced Thursday the closing of a $3 million pre-seed round.
The company was co-founded by its CEO Andrew D’Souza, Matt Stein, Shen Sivananthan, and brothers Ankur Boyed and Abhinav Boyed. They came up with this idea in March, started building it throughout the summer, and just launched officially this month.
The way it works is simple: A user gives their number to Boardy.ai and receives a phone call from an AI voice assistant named, of course, Boardy. The person chats to Boardy, telling the AI what they are working on. Boardy then checks if anyone in the Boardy network might be able to help. The network Boardy knows — which D’Souza says consists right now of a few thousand — started with D’Souza’s own network of investors, founders, and creators and has expanded since then. It is mainly used for people who are looking to meet customers and investors and has also helped people get into accelerator programs and get matched with co-founders, he said.
“If Boardy has spoken with someone he thinks would make a good connection based on both experience, as well as whether the two of you would actually get along, he will try and facilitate a double-opt-in introduction,” D’Souza explained. If the introduction is accepted, then Boardy introduces both parties via email. “You can call Boardy back every week to work on a new introduction for you.”
D’Souza said they started the company because of how lonely social media has made people. In fact, studies are now showing that America in particular is in the midst of a loneliness epidemic, which started even before the pandemic. D’Souza said there is a fear that AI will exacerbate the loneliness epidemic, taking jobs and displacing what makes people feel human.
While other startups are building AI-generated companions, sometimes with disturbing results, Boardy is using AI to facilitate human connections.
“We built Boardy to create a better future, where AI actually makes us more connected to each other and where humans and AI collaborate to solve humanity’s hardest problems,” D’Souza said.
Before this, D’Souza co-founded and led the e-commerce company Clearco. After almost 10 years at Clearco, he said the company grew to a size where they needed a more seasoned capital markets expert to lead the company. He willingly decided to leave as they brought on a new CEO, while D’Souza set forth on a new path.
Fundraising for Boardy was easy, as the round primarily consisted of investors D’Souza met through Clearco. HF0 was the largest investor in the round, with others participating, including 8VC, Precursor, Afore, FJ Labs, and NextView.
“Going forward, I hope to meet more of my investors through Boardy,” he said.
Boardy will use the fresh capital to continue building and training the AI, hoping to make it smarter and more empathetic. The team is also working to expand Boardy’s personal network to connect users with more people.
There aren’t many competitors to Boardy at the moment, though there are companies building in the AI social networking space, such as Butterflies and SocialAI. There are AI companies to help consumers build agents and help with consumer interactions and booking appointments, though. D’Souza hopes Boardy is different, saying the AI agent “works for himself.”
“You can ask Boardy for help and he’ll do his best to help you, but not at the expense of other people in his network,” he continued. “You can’t tell Boardy what to do, which is actually what makes him more trustworthy.”
This piece was updated to add the additional names of Boardy’s co-founders."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/finix-raises-75-million-to-take-on-stripe-as-a-payment-processor/,Finix raises $75M to take on Stripe as a payment processor | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-10-24,"For years, Finix has been slowly chipping away at Stripe – which handles payments for millions of businesses. But after previously helping companies set up internal payment systems of their own, the startup officially became a payment processor in 2023, just like Stripe. Now Finix is gearing up for its biggest push against the fintech giant yet.
In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO and founder Richie Serna says becoming a payment processor was “hugely transformational” for the business, and a main driver of its $75 million fundraise, which it announced on Thursday.
Serna says Finix has quadrupled its revenue in the last year, though he declined to share its true number of merchants. However, he told TechCrunch in 2022 that Finix was supporting more than 12,000 merchants and says Finix closed more deals in 2024 than in the company’s entire history — so Finix could have more than 24,000 merchants today.
That’s still a long way off from the customer base of Stripe, who Finix directly competes with — at least if you ask Sequoia Capital. The venture firm led Finix’s $35 million Series B round in 2020, only to walk away from the investment weeks later after determining a conflict of interest with Stripe, which it also backed. Finix got to keep the money but lost Sequoia as a backer.
Four years later, Serna says that moment helped put Finix on the map, and hasn’t had a lasting effect on the business. In fact, Serna says fintech companies like Stripe, Finix, and Adyen all have lots of room to grow in the payments space.
“One thing that we kind of try to correct, in terms of the narrative, is this idea that Stripe owns the entire market. We live in Silicon Valley. Everybody sort of believes that,” said Serna. “And so Stripe only actually owns 6% of the US market, and less than 2% worldwide. So payments is still relatively fragmented, and probably about 91% of payments today still goes through systems that were built back in the ’80s and the ’90s,” he noted.
So why would someone choose Finix over Stripe, and how are they different?
When Serna founded Finix, he didn’t see it as a payments business, but instead as a “payments infrastructure” company. Now that’s changing.
In some ways, these companies are more similar today than when Sequoia abandoned its investment in Finix for being too competitive with Stripe. Both process payments for businesses, require little to no coding to get set up, and operate in Canada and the United States.
However, Serna says Finix is specifically building products for businesses with both in-store and online footprints that don’t have the developers to build out those experiences. He says there are tens of millions of these companies in America. To this end, Finix offers more options for physical payments, integrating with several different payment devices.
Serna also says Finix offers more visibility into its pricing. Stripe takes a clean, but obscure, 2.9% cut of every transaction, plus a 30-cent fee. Finix, on the other hand, uses a cost-plus model, breaking down everything it’s charging a customer for and showing their markup.
With the new investment, Finix says it’s focused on growing its team beyond the 130 employees it has today and expanding into more countries around the world. Ideally the startup is hoping to take a bigger bite out of America’s payments system.
The $75 million round was led by Acrew Capital and co-led by Leap Global and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Other investors in the round include Citi Ventures, Tribeca Venture Partners, Homebrew, Insight Partners, Inspired Capital, and Cap Table Coalition. Finix has now raised $208 million in total funding to date with this Series C, which comes more than two years since the startup secured a $30 million tranche. Finix would not disclose its current valuation to TechCrunch but says this was an up round."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/general-catalyst-raises-8b-in-fresh-funds-to-back-startups-globally/,General Catalyst raises $8B in fresh funds to back startups globally | TechCrunch,"Paul Sawers, Mike Butcher",2024-10-24,"U.S. venture capital giant General Catalyst has announced a fresh $8 billion in funds as it looks to ramp up its investments in multi-sector early-stage startups globally, with a specific focus on the U.S., Europe, and India.
The capital constitutes around $4.5 billion for its “core VC funds,” which spans seed and growth equity funding, while $1.5 billion is earmarked for its so-called “creation strategy,” which is focused on helping repeat or “proven” founders build new companies. An additional $2 billion is for “separately managed accounts” — which are typically special investment vehicles created for a single institutional investor.
“As a global investment company that seeks to partner with the world’s most ambitious entrepreneurs to drive transformation, resilience, and applied AI, we believe this capital will turbocharge our investment theses across AI, defense and intelligence, climate and energy, industrials, healthcare and fintech,” General Catalyst CEO and managing director Hemant Taneja (pictured above), wrote in a blog post today.
Founded in 2000, General Catalyst has backed some of the biggest U.S. technology startups, including Airbnb, Instacart, Snap, Kayak, Stripe, and HubSpot, though it has backed numerous international companies, too, such as Deliveroo in Europe. More recently, General Catalyst has pursued global growth through merging with local entities, including La Famiglia in Europe last year and, more recently, Venture Highway in India.
General Catalyst now has more than $30 billion in assets under management.
Today’s announcement comes shortly after TechCrunch reported that General Catalyst was working on a “continuation” fund worth up to $1 billion, a mechanism through which it would continue to hold and invest in its portfolio companies beyond what would be a typical VC fund timescale.
Elsewhere, TechCrunch recently reported that General Catalyst is gearing up to make its first investment in Saudi Arabia, and that it now offers a financial product to both late-stage private companies and product companies that want it to capitalize their customer and marketing spend separately.
General Catalyst’s latest funding comes months after another giant fundraise by a U.S. venture firm: Andreessen Horowitz’s announcement in April that it had closed on $7.2 billion.
Speaking exclusively to TechCrunch, Jeannette zu Fürstenberg, who now heads General Catalyst’s European business, said that 25% of the $8 billion raised would be allocated to Europe, across all its various strategies.
“The core thesis is to hone-in on talent at the earliest stages. We are a global transformation company with early-stage investment at its core,” she said in a call with TechCrunch.
Following the merger of General Catalyst and her VC firm La Famiglia last year, she said the company wants to “double-click on pre-seed and seed as one core bucket, where we want to drive all the platform capabilities and all the capabilities towards founders.”
In relation to how it plans to execute its “creation” strategy, she said the plan is to partner with large companies that are, for instance, “looking to embed AI and looking to build a product… We are looking to co-develop and co-hatch products together with them… We’ve already done that with Fever Energy, a Scandinavian climate tech company, because that will require a sort of more hybrid capital approach down the line.”
She fleshed this out further, saying General Catalyst has engaged in what it likes to call “roll-ups”: “We’ve embraced different vertical sectors and functions from a company perspective.” This includes Crescendo, a call center software that has AI embedded in it.
As a firm, she said General Catalyst is doing things “the other way around.” That means “building the tech stack… and then reaping the whole benefit from going full stack” by embedding AI in an investment. “We are doing a similar playbook in Europe, where our existing network blends with that strategy and also blends with the talent ambition that we have here,” she said.
General Catalyst is also honing in on two core themes: what she calls applied AI and global resilience. “Our belief system is that AI, at the core, is not a disruptive technology. It doesn’t give you new distribution avenues. It basically gives you a transformation angle into existing categories.”
This would translate into applying AI into sectors such as manufacturing, or supply chains.
“If you look at Europe, the benefit we can really derive from AI comes down to how it intersects with many of these vertical strengths that we have [in the country],” she said.
On global resilience, she said that in the wake of destabilizing issues such as the pandemic, wars, and the energy crisis, nations “cannot afford to be at the mercy of others… We don’t want to rely on China for the majority of the stuff that we cannot replicate here, right?”
She pointed to the global shortage of antibiotics during the pandemic, for example. “I think there is a very strong insight that we need to come closer to re-owning these core verticals. And this can be extended towards energy systems, defense etc. These are critical to us being able to maintain societies as they are, and maintain our sovereignty to a very large degree. So what are the fly-wheels we can activate, where can we back founders, connect them to established industry partners, and help them embed that.”
To highlight her point, she singled out General Catalyst portfolio company Helsing, a self-described AI defense company that has now entered partnerships with Airbus and Saab.
“They’re in partnership with some of the largest European defense primes,” said zu Fürstenberg. “And there’s a strong intersection that is driven to really bring the potential of AI into the sectors that we will think is key to resilience. AI and global resilience as two core themes are really coalescing to a very large degree.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/linkedin-fined-356-million-in-eu-for-tracking-ads-privacy-breaches/,LinkedIn fined $335 million in EU for tracking ads privacy breaches | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-24,"Bad news for LinkedIn in Europe, where the Microsoft-owned social network has been reprimanded and fined €310 million for privacy violations related to its tracking ads business.
The administrative penalties, which are worth around $335 million at current exchange rates, have been issued by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The regulator found a raft of breaches, including breaches to the lawfulness, fairness and transparency of its data processing in this area.
The GDPR requires that uses of people’s information have a proper legal basis. In this case, the justifications LinkedIn had relied upon to run its tracking ads business were found to be invalid. It also did not properly inform users about its uses of their information, per the DPC’s decision.
LinkedIn had sought to claim (variously) “consent”-, “legitimate interests”-, and “contractual necessity”-based legal bases for processing people’s information — when obtained directly and/or from third parties — to track and profile its users for behavioral advertising. However, the DPC found none were valid. LinkedIn also failed to comply with the GDPR principles of transparency and fairness.
Commenting in a statement, DPC deputy commissioner Graham Doyle said: “The lawfulness of processing is a fundamental aspect of data protection law and the processing of personal data without an appropriate legal basis is a clear and serious violation of a data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection.”
The size of the sanction catapults the professional social network into a mid-table position in the top 10 biggest GDPR penalties on Big Tech. And while this is not the first time LinkedIn has been slapped for regional data protection violations, it is certainly its most significant sanction to date. (Albeit, the company was keen to flag that the size of the fine was less than the amount Microsoft set aside in an earlier 10-K disclosure alerting investors that it expected a sanction.)
The case against LinkedIn originated with a complaint in France in 2018 by the digital rights non-profit La Quadrature Du Net. The country’s data protection authority then passed the complaint to the DPC, on account of its role as lead oversight body for Microsoft’s GDPR compliance.
The DPC instigated a complaint-based investigation in August 2018 before finally going on to submit its draft decision to other interested data protection authorities almost a full six years later (in July 2024). After no objections were raised, the decision was finalized and the enforcement has now been made public.
As well as being fined, LinkedIn has been given three months to bring its European operations into compliance with the GDPR.
LinkedIn spokesman Jonny Wing pointed TechCrunch to a statement put out on the company’s press room regarding the sanction in which it wrote: “Today the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) reached a final decision on claims from 2018 about some of our digital advertising efforts in the EU. While we believe we have been in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we are working to ensure our ad practices meet this decision by the IDPC’s deadline.”
This report was updated with a correction to the currency conversion of the DPC fine."

The transaction was led by private equity giant TPG, with other new participants including Baillie Gifford, FJ Labs, Hedosophia, Invus Opportunities, Manhattan Venture Partners, and Moore Strategic Ventures. It’s unclear how much Vinted’s existing investors cashed out, but the company says that all its existing institutional investors — which include Accel, EQT, Insight Partners, and Lightspeed Venture Partners — have retained at least some stake.
It’s proving to be a bumper year for secondary market transactions, particularly in Europe, as scale-ups seek to unlock liquidity for their employees and VCs in a decidedly tepid IPO market. In the past few months alone, we’ve seen neobanks Revolut and Monzo pursue secondary market routes, attaining lofty valuations off the back of strong user growth and profitability.
In the U.S., meanwhile, fintech giant Stripe followed a similar path to unlock liquidity, reaching a private valuation of $65 billion back in February as it continues to delay a long-rumored IPO. This figure later jumped to $70 billion as Sequoia  sought a larger stake from existing investors.
Vinted CEO Thomas Plantenga (pictured above) noted that the sale “rewards our employees for their dedication in making Vinted a success.” The company was valued at €3.5 billion ($3.8 billion) pre-money for its previous €250 million Series F fundraise back in 2021. Since then, it has gone from strength to strength, reporting record revenue growth of 61% in 2023 compared to the previous year and reaching profitability for the first time.
At the same time, Vinted has expanded geographically and is also extending beyond its core fashion roots into the electronics realm — a growth trajectory that prompted marketplace stalwart eBay to respond by removing seller fees in key European markets."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/perplexity-launches-a-native-mac-app/,Perplexity launches a native Mac app | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-24,"AI-focused search startup Perplexity launched its native Mac app today to compete with other AI apps like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Quora’s Poe app — the latter aggregates different large language models.
Perplexity had teased the app earlier this month and asked users to sign up for preorders so they get a notification when the app is available.
The Mac app is free to use, but you can buy Perplexity Pro for $20 a month or $200 a year. This subscription gives users the benefit of more than 300 Pro searches, which are more in-depth search results as compared to its free quick search tier.
The Mac version also allows you to quickly invoke the Perplexity search through keyboard shortcuts. You can also access voice mode, file upload, and voice dictation mode using shortcuts. While you could upload files and ask questions by typing on the website, the addition of voice mode and dictation is helpful for people who are more comfortable with audio interactions.
The new app also lets you ask follow-up questions and browse your conversation history through the sidebar. The company launched both its iOS and Android apps last year.
Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Perplexity is looking to raise $500 million in funding that would double its valuation to $8 billion. Earlier this month, The New York Times sent the company a cease-and-desist letter accusing the startup of scraping and plagiarism."

“The Court of Justice dismisses the Commission’s appeal, thereby upholding the judgment of the General Court,” the CJEU wrote in a press release Thursday.
The portion of the EU enforcement that failed concerned “conditional rebates” Intel provided to computer makers for using its chips. The Commission had argued that these rebates were anti-competitive, but the judges ultimately disagreed.
However, Intel hasn’t won everything: The 2022 ruling confirmed its “naked restrictions” as unlawful — practices consisting of paying PC makers to halt or delay production of products containing rival chips. The chipmaker did not appeal this finding, which is why the EU issued a new fine last fall of around $400 million."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/spotify-adds-auto-moderation-tool-to-help-podcasters-manage-comments/,Spotify adds auto-moderation tool to help podcasters manage comments | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-24,"Spotify in July started letting listeners comment on podcast episodes on the app, and the company is now rolling out a new set of controls to help podcasters manage and moderate comments.
When comments were first launched, podcasters initially had to review comments and publish them. Now, the platform has added a configurable auto-moderation tool that can filter out sensitive or inappropriate comments for review and publish the rest.
When set to the “Standard” level, Spotify’s new tool will not publish comments that it detects as potentially sensitive or inappropriate, and instead will redirect them to the podcaster for review. When set to “High,” the tool will hold all comments until they are approved, and on “Low,” it will automatically post all comments except those that violate Spotify’s rules.
Spotify noted that even if a creator publishes comments flagged as sensitive or sets the auto-moderation level to “Low,” sensitive comments will still be hidden, and users will need to tap on “Show all comments” to view them.
Creators can also add words, phrases, or emojis to a blocklist to automatically move comments that include them to the review queue.
Creators can also turn off comments for any episodes they deem fit.
The company said it plans to add support for additional languages for this feature.
“For now, as we continue to test and as we develop our automatic detection systems to support more languages, all non-English comments will need to continue to be reviewed and approved in Spotify for Podcasters, but we plan to expand to more languages soon,” the company said in a blog post.
Spotify said its users have posted 2.5 million comments across 650,000 episodes since it launched the comments feature in July, and about 44% of published comments get a like or a reply from the creator of the show.
Spotify has been trying to make podcasts more engaging for a while now by adding support for Q&As, polls, and video podcasts. Earlier this year, the company said people who use any of these features to engage with podcasts are four times more likely to listen to the show again within 30 days."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/raspberry-pi-releases-more-ai-focused-add-ons/,Raspberry Pi releases more AI-focused add-ons | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-10-24,"Raspberry Pi has been shipping new products at a rapid pace lately. This week, the company is adding several new products to its lineup to extend the functionalities of the Raspberry Pi 5.
Raspberry Pi is mostly known for its tiny, cheap, single-board computers that are widely used by hobbyists and schools, as well as industrial and electronics manufacturing companies. The Raspberry Pi 5, the company’s flagship product, features a PCIe 3.0 interface exposed with a 16-pin connector.
The company has been selling M.2 HAT+ extension cards that convert the 16-pin connector to a more traditional M.2 connector. HAT stands for “Hardware Attached on Top”, a cute acronym the company has been using to refer to extension cards that you attach to a regular Raspberry Pi.
Raspberry Pi users have been taking advantage of that M.2 slot to add NVMe SSDs (more on that below) and other add-ons. For instance, Raspberry Pi back in June started selling an AI Kit that’s essentially an M.2 extension card with a neural network inference accelerator from Hailo.
Today, the company is launching a brand new HAT+ add-on board with a built-in Hailo inference accelerator. The Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ comes in 13 and 26 tera-operations per second (TOPS) variants, retailing at $70 and $110 respectively. The 13 TOPS variant features the same module as the one in the existing AI Kit.
You’re not going to train a GPT on a Raspberry Pi, but these AI add-ons are a cost-effective way to perform inference at the edge.
Unlike the M.2 HAT+, the AI HAT+ doesn’t have an M.2 interface. It’s a single package designed for Hailo’s inference modules.
Here’s what the AI HAT+ looks like (left) compared to the M.2 HAT+ when used with the AI Kit (right):
If you’re familiar with PC components, you know that most modern NVMe storage drives also use M.2 connectors. There are different SSD types though, and they come in varying form factors and performance speeds.
For the Raspberry Pi 5, you can use any NVMe SSD in the 2230 and 2242 form factors that are compatible with PCIe 3.0. Off-the-shelf SSDs will work fine with a Raspberry Pi 5 with an M.2 HAT+ extension.
The company is also launching its own branded M.2 NVMe SSDs — the 256GB variant sells for $30 and the 512GB version goes for $45. For context, a 256GB SSD with similar specifications currently costs between $20 and $30 on Amazon.
The company also sells SSD Kit bundles with both an M.2 HAT+ and an SSD in a single box. The 256GB SSD Kit costs $40, while the 512GB one costs $55.
These SSD Kits aren’t going to revolutionize the Raspberry Pi ecosystem, but they are a nice way to make sure you’re buying an SSD that is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 5 and its M.2 HAT+ attachment."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/nvidia-deepens-india-ai-drive-with-new-partnerships/,Nvidia signs a slew of AI deals in India push | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-10-24,"Nvidia is embarking on a series of partnerships with Indian firms to deploy its AI chips and technology, deepening its push into a key growth market.
The U.S. chip designer’s CEO, Jensen Huang (pictured above), said the company has partnered with Reliance, India’s most valuable company, to build infrastructure for AI applications in India. He also said Tech Mahindra would use Nvidia’s chips and software to develop Indus 2.0, an AI model in Hindi. Infrastructure providers Tata Communications and Yotta Data Services also plan to buy and use tens of thousands of Nvidia H100 chips by the end of the year.
Huang was presenting at the company’s ongoing AI Summit event in Mumbai, which comes at a time when Indian technology service providers are rushing to build AI capabilities. Infosys, Wipro, and other IT companies have been using Nvidia’s software to develop custom AI applications for corporate clients.
“India used to be a country that exported software. In the future, India will be a country that exports AI,” said Huang.
Wipro said it has trained 225,000 employees on Nvidia’s AI platforms, while Tata Consultancy Services said it has trained 50,000 staff as AI associates. More than 500,000 developers in India have joined Nvidia’s developer program, the company said.
Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart and software provider Zoho will also use Nvidia’s technology to build large language models in Hindi.
The partnerships expand on Nvidia’s existing tie-ups with Reliance Industries to build large language models for Indian languages. That deal included plans for AI cloud infrastructure and training for employees as well.
A few Indian startups are also using Nvidia’s technology: CoRover.ai said its chatbot for Indian Railways handles 150,000 queries in multiple languages every day, and claims it has facilitated more than 10 billion customer interactions since launch.
Nvidia has trained more than 100,000 Indian AI developers as it competes with rivals AMD and Intel for India’s growing AI chip market."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/cash-collection-startup-upflow-also-wants-to-handle-b2b-payments/,Cash collection startup Upflow also wants to handle B2B payments | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-10-24,"Upflow, a French startup we’ve been covering for quite a while, originally focused on managing outstanding invoices. The company is now announcing a shift in its strategy to become a B2B payment platform with its own payment gateway to complement its accounts receivable automation solution.
Like many software-as-a-service products, Upflow started by building a central hub specifically designed for one job in particular: CFOs. From the Upflow dashboards, CFOs and finance teams could see all their company’s invoices, track payments, communicate with team members, and send reminders to clients.
It integrates nicely with other financial tools and services to automatically import data from those third-party services. And a tool like Upflow can be particularly important as many tech companies struggle to raise their next funding round and want to improve their cash balance.
But that was just the first step in a bigger roadmap.
“Basically, my vision has always been that the real problem is payment methods,” Upflow co-founder and CEO Alexandre Louisy (pictured above) told TechCrunch. “Today, when you pay in a store, you pay with your phone. When you pay for your Spotify subscription or your Amazon subscription, you don’t even think about how you pay.”
“But when you look at B2B payments, the way you pay today hasn’t changed in the last 50 years. And for us, that’s why people struggle with late payments. The thing I’m really trying to fight against is the idea that late payments are linked to bad payers.“
According to him, around 90% of B2B payments still happen offline in the U.S. It’s still mostly paper checks. In Europe, it’s a different story as companies have adopted bank transfers. But transfers “are completely unstructured and require manual reconciliation,” Louisy said.
Upflow sells its accounts receivable automation software tool to midsized companies with a revenue between $10 million and $500 million per year. The company’s biggest client generates around $1 billion in annual revenue.
“But when you ask [CFOs], ‘What’s your strategy for setting up direct debit on part of your customer base?’ They don’t have a solution,” Louisy said.
Upflow helps you set up incentive strategies so that a portion of your client base moves to online payments, such as card payments or direct debits. The idea isn’t that all your clients are going to pay with a business card overnight. But Upflow can help you change the payment method for something like 20% or 30% of your client base.
Just like CRMs help you manage your sales processes with clients, Upflow now wants to be a financial relationship management (FRM) solution. It’s an interesting strategy as it shows how a startup like Upflow is thinking about diversifying its revenue sources.
“With our model shift, we’re moving from a model where we are 100% based on SaaS revenue to a hybrid model where we have SaaS revenue and payment revenue because we have our own payment gateway that we’ve set up with Stripe,” Louisy said.
Payment is the second brick in Upflow’s product suite. Up next, the company plans to integrate financing options with B2B “buy now, pay later” payment methods on the supplier front and factoring for a company’s outstanding invoices.
“We evaluate solutions … that provide embedded finance,” Louisy said. ”It’s not our core business to perform risk assessment. On the other hand, what’s interesting is that we can bring them useful data for credit scoring that they don’t necessarily have when they just connect to one of our users’ accounts.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/pinterest-faces-eu-privacy-complaint-over-tracking-ads/,Pinterest faces EU privacy complaint over tracking ads | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-24,"When it comes to privacy nightmares, Pinterest is unlikely to be the first social app that springs to mind. But the visual discovery engine’s use of tracking ads is the target of the latest complaint from European privacy rights nonprofit noyb, which accuses it of breaching the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by failing to obtain consent from users to being tracked and profiled for advertising.
The GDPR allows for penalties of up to 4% of global annual turnover for confirmed breaches, so such complaints can lead to substantial sanctions for tech giants.
While Pinterest has generally flown under the radar, with regard to online privacy issues — especially compared to other mainstream ad-funded social services (such as Facebook) — it’s worth recalling that the company’s tracking and profiling was pulled center stage in the tragic case of the suicide in 2017 of the U.K. schoolgirl, Molly Russell. She had pro-suicide content pushed into her social feeds by a number of apps, including Pinterest.
A 2022 “Prevention of Future Deaths” report by a U.K. coroner found that “negative effects of online content” were a factor in her death. It was the result of the ad-funded platforms’ pervasive tracking and profiling of users.
In the noyb-backed complaint against Pinterest, which has been filed with France’s data protection authority, the platform is also accused of failing to fulfill a GDPR data access request. It didn’t provide information on the categories of data about the complainant that were shared with third parties.
As well as requiring that companies have a valid legal basis to process people’s data, the GDPR provides individuals in the EU with a suite of access rights, such as the ability to request a copy of their information.
Pinterest is relying upon a legal basis for processing people’s data for ad targeting that’s known as legitimate interest (LI). However, noyb argues this use is non-compliant with the GDPR.
It points to a July 2023 ruling by the EU’s top court which denied Facebook owner Meta’s ability to ram its own surveillance ads business through LI* — asserting that Pinterest must therefore obtain Europeans’ consent to run its own “personalized ads” business.
As it stands, Pinterest, which has some 130 million regional users, tracks all of them by default to “personalize” ads.
Any Pinterest user in Europe who wishes not to be tracked and profiled in this way must take the active step of objecting to its processing (the GDPR requires that users are provided with the ability to object to processing if LI is the legal basis), rather than being affirmatively asked whether they’re okay with their information being used like this, as noyb believes should be the case here.
“Pinterest is secretly tracking European users without asking for their consent,” said Kleanthi Sardeli, a data protection lawyer at noyb, in a statement on the complaint. “This allows the social media platform to unlawfully profit from people’s personal data without them ever finding out.”
“It appears that Pinterest is actively ignoring a European Court of Justice (CJEU) ruling in order to maximise its profits. The CJEU made it clear that personalised advertising cannot be based on legitimate interest,” Sardeli added.
noyb’s complaint against Pinterest has been filed on behalf of an unnamed user who it said had not realized the platform was tracking her without consent.
She only discovered Pinterest’s tracking when she looked at the “privacy and data” settings — where she found that “ads personalization” was turned on by default. She also found that the platform uses information from “visited websites” and other third parties for ads display, as well as tracking her on-site activity for this purpose. In short, Pinterest is in the surveillance ads business.
“This practice is clearly unlawful since the introduction of the GDPR in 2018,” noyb wrote in a press release. “In its ruling in case C252/21 Bundeskartellamt in 2023, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) found again that personalised advertising cannot be based on legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.”
The complainant also took the step of filing a data access request to Pinterest. But the copy of her data she received didn’t include any information about the recipients of her data, per noyb.
“Even after two additional requests, Pinterest failed to provide details about the categories of data that were shared with third parties,” it wrote, adding: “In other words: Pinterest failed to adequately respond to the access request under Article 15(1)(c) GDPR.”
The complaint calls for Pinterest to delete any data it has processed for ads and inform users it has done so. The company should also fulfill the complainant’s data access request. Additionally, noyb is pressing for it to be fined at a level that would act as a deterrent for future GDPR breaches.
Pinterest has been contacted for a response to the complaint. Update: Spokeswoman Jess Brand has now emailed a statement in which Pinterest rejects noyb’s accusations. “Pinterest’s approach to personalized advertising is GDPR compliant,” it wrote.
The company also told us it does not permit personalized advertising to be served to under 18s in the EU and the U.K.
While noyb has filed this case in France, where the regulator (CNIL) has a strong reputation for enforcing on privacy complaints — including around the issue of consent — it’s possible it could be passed to Ireland’s Data Protection Commission on account of Pinterest having its regional HQ in Dublin. (And because of the GDPR’s “one-stop shop” mechanism for streamlining oversight of complaints that span EU borders.)
However, noyb told TechCrunch it has filed the complaint against Pinterest’s U.S.-based entity, pointing out that the company’s privacy policy names both Pinterest Europe and Pinterest, Inc. (i.e. the U.S. entity) as joint data controllers for the processing.
“The CNIL therefore is the competent authority and shouldn’t forward the complaint to Ireland,” it suggested. “But we of course don’t know if they will do so anyway.”
* For its part, Meta has since switched to a consent-based legal basis for its tracking ads.

By 2025, our global data volume will reach 175 zetabytes, a figure that is 50% more than 2023. But while the wealth of data grows, it remains unwieldy to use. Poor data quality costs organizations an average of $12.9 million annually. As organizations grapple with the exponential growth of data, they need better data transformation solutions to process it. The worldwide spending on such digital transformation solutions is forecasted to reach $3.9 trillion by 2027. In other words, the market is ripe for challenging the status quo, even despite the continued growth of data darlings Snowflake and Databricks. Tomasz can speak to the future of data in the context of SF and DB’s direct competition, and how startups are tackling these challenges head-on amidst the acceleration of two industry giants.
Led by Natalie Pan, Mariane Bekker, and Jeni Chang, Women Founders Bay; Aury Cifuentes, How Women Invest

With rising interest rates and stricter regulatory scrutiny on acquisitions, many growth and late-stage companies that once secured billions in funding are struggling to achieve a successful outcome. In this session, two experienced investors will debate the state of late-stage venture, what they’re seeing in terms of deal activity, if this market is actually coming back as significantly as some are reporting, and where they see the landscape headed in 2025. As part of this, they will dig into what’s going on with IPO markets, whether/when they will open back up, and how this is impacting exit strategies for founders.
Led by Jane Alexander, CapitalG; Chris Klayko, Databricks; Kareem Amin, Clay; Austin Hughes, Unify
From auto-generated outbound messages to AI-written blog posts, AI is fundamentally changing the way that companies go to market. Come discuss the tension between AI-powered automation and human creativity with the founders building these products and the leading practitioners who use them.
Led by Turner Novak, Banana Capital; Kira McCroden, Forerunner; Emilie Gerber, Six Eastern; Jack Randall, Aetherflux
The communications and PR landscape has dramatically shifted in recent years: new mediums (Substack, podcasts) have spiked in influence and popularity, fueling new strategies (“going direct”) for shaping and amplifying public perceptions — all while an increasingly critical media landscape continues to hold all types of industry stakeholders accountable. How can early and growing companies responsibly navigate these changes and be successful in building an inspiring brand? This roundtable will dissect the growing breadth and importance of different comms functions: the under-appreciated, consequential nature of internal comms, the increasingly indispensable need for owned channels, the pros and cons of political takes amidst an election year, and how to actually get meaningful press coverage for a company. The tech communications industry has arguably never been more dynamic.
Led by Alessandra Andrenacci, Dropbox
Many startups today fundraise on the promise of being an “AI-first company.” But how do investors distinguish between companies that organically have AI at their core and those that are “GPT wrappers”? How can founders demonstrate that AI is intrinsic to their business and not an add-on intended to ride the wave of AI interest? This session addresses these and related questions by focusing on meaningfully incorporating AI into your startup and getting funded by investors. We use cutting-edge fundraising stats from DocSend to frame the conversation and ask founders and VCs how AI is changing fundraising expectations and how startups can organically incorporate AI into their businesses while staying ahead of increasingly sophisticated investor interest.
Led by Roeland Nusselder and Tony Fadell, Plumerai
Nest founder, former SVP of Apple’s iPhone and iPod teams, and principal at Build Collective, Tony Fadell joins Plumerai’s co-founder and CEO Roeland Nusselder to discuss how Tiny AI is democratizing AI. By making AI smaller, efficient, and cost-effective, Tiny AI is paving the way for widespread adoption across industries, fostering innovation, and putting the power of AI into the hands of many. Tiny AI is shaping a future where intelligence is embedded all around us, enhancing our daily lives in ways we’ve only dreamed of. The future is here, and it’s smaller than you think!

Led by Po Bronson, Pae Wu, and Duncan Turner, SOSV
Venture’s deep chill has been extra frigid for deep tech startups due to their reputation for long timelines and big capital needs. But investors are still game for deep tech startups that are smart about balancing product scope and time to market. Vertical integration and industrial scale-ups are out; selling innovation into existing supply chains, now that’s smart. SOSV general partners Duncan Turner, Dr. Pae Wu, and Po Bronson help oversee the launch of about 75 deep tech startups a year and work with hundreds of deep tech co-investors. They will discuss what’s getting investors to “yes” to deep tech investments now, and take questions from the audience.
Led by Arvind Purushotham, Citi Ventures; Ari Tuchman, Quantifind; Kartik Mani, Citi
Arvind, along with Citi partners and portfolio company Quantifind, will discuss Citi Ventures’ approach to working with startups and how governance and risk management are essential to responsible innovation.

Led by Megs Shah, The Parasol Cooperative; Chad Sniffen, National Network to End Domestic Violence; Sahab Aslam, Sukan Ventures
In today’s startup world, one data breach or safety failure can destroy your reputation and growth. For founders, the challenge is how to scale while ensuring user safety, privacy, and security, all within budget. VCs are focusing on startups with strong ESG practices, prioritizing those that address safety early. Failing to comply with data laws, such as COPPA, can result in penalties up to $170 million.
This session covers how to build safeguards to prevent tech misuse, like Apple AirTag’s misuse for stalking. With one in three women globally experiencing violence and 32 million child exploitation reports submitted to NCMEC in one year, tech’s role in abuse is a rising threat. We will also explore how open source security tools can cut costs by 55% and how addressing safety and security early prevents legal risks and attracts ethical investors, and most importantly protects the vulnerable.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/xs-india-revenue-falls-90-filing-shows/,Elon Musk's X hit by 90% revenue plunge in India | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-10-24,"X’s revenue in India plummeted 89.8% to $2.51 million in the financial year ending March, according to regulatory filings from the Elon Musk-owned social network.
The company, which had posted revenue of $24.7 million in the previous fiscal year, also significantly reduced its expenses in India to $2.2 million from $20 million year-over-year, the filing revealed.
Despite the dramatic revenue drop, the India unit managed to report a profit of $380,000 for the fiscal year ending March, down from $3.62 million in the prior year.
Musk previously identified India as a key market for Twitter. In an earlier lawsuit Musk had filed against Twitter, he said he believed India was the company’s third-largest market.
It remains unclear why X’s revenue declined so dramatically in the country, but it coincides with widespread local and global layoffs. The downturn also mirrors the platform’s global struggles to retain advertisers.
X didn’t respond to a request for comment."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/tesla-is-testing-a-robotaxi-service-that-elon-musk-claims-will-launch-next-year/,Tesla is testing a robotaxi service that Elon Musk claims will launch next year | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-23,"Elon Musk said he hopes to launch a service that will let people hail self-driving Tesla vehicles in California and Texas sometime in 2025 — and claims his company has already been testing the service in the Bay Area with employees.
The comments, made Wednesday on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, go farther than what Musk promised two weeks ago at its Cybercab unveiling event. On that stage, Musk promised that Model 3 and Model Y owners would be able to use an “unsupervised” version of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software in California and Texas. But he made no mention of the ride-hailing network, despite Tesla having teased the idea for years.
It’s unclear if Tesla would be required to get permission from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles to conduct the tests Musk said his company is already performing. The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
David Lau, Tesla’s VP of software engineering, said on the call that the cars employees have been hailing have had safety drivers at the wheel. And to be clear, no Tesla vehicles can currently drive themselves without human intervention.
Today, Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software, or FSD, is considered an advanced driver assistance system — not a self-driving system like the one Waymo uses in its robotaxis. FSD offers some automated features that are available on highways and city streets, however the system still requires the driver to pay attention and take control.
Musk said on the call that Tesla would go through the proper regulatory approval process in California before opening such a service to everyday consumers, though he lamented the red tape and said he expects smoother process in his home state of Texas. The regulatory process in California to launch a commercial robotaxi service has multiple tiers that require approval from the DMV and the California Public Utilities Commission. Waymo is the only company currently allowed to operate a commercial drvierless robotaxi service in San Francisco.
Musk also opined that Tesla might launch the service in other states by the end of next year, too.
These claims come after years of Musk overpromising on Tesla’s ability to develop software that can autonomously drive cars. He originally promised in 2016 in a since-deleted post on Tesla’s website that “All Tesla Cars Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware,” and in the following years made it seem that it would only take the flip of a switch to fill the streets with self-driving cars.
Even the hardware part of that promise has not borne out.
Tesla has had to upgrade cars with those early version of the so-called “Full Self-Driving” hardware. And Musk admitted on Wednesday’s call that cars equipped with what Tesla calls “Hardware 3” — which it started building into its EVs in 2019 — may not ultimately be able to drive themselves. If Tesla does someday get to the point where its software can drive vehicles without supervision, and it doesn’t work on Hardware 3, Musk promised to swap out that hardware at no cost to owners."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/the-space-development-agency-taps-19-companies-for-future-defense-demo-missions/,The Space Development Agency taps 19 companies for future defense demo missions | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-23,"The Space Development Agency (SDA) has selected 19 companies to compete for future contracts under a new program designed to rapidly onboard new contractors for defense demonstration missions. Each company will receive an initial $20,000 to cover administrative expenses.
These companies have essentially been preapproved to bid on future prototype missions to support the SDA’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), a massive planned satellite constellation in low Earth orbit that will provide missile tracking and advanced communications capabilities for the Department of Defense (DOD).
The Hybrid Acquisition for Proliferated LEO (HALO) program awardees will compete on programs related to a batch of planned satellites in the PWSA called the Tranche 2 Demonstration and Experimentation System (T2DES). (It’s a mouthful, but each layer of the constellation is referred to as a “tranche.”) T2DES will likely include around 20 satellites configured into several variants. According to the program solicitation, HALO contracts “will focus on rapid, end-to-end mission demonstrations designed to launch 2 identical satellites” between 12 and 18 months after the award date.
These satellites will augment what the SDA calls the Tranche 2 transport layer, a vast constellation of over 200 satellites that will provide high-speed communications and data relays for the DOD.
But as the pool of awardees suggests, the HALO awardees will also be able to compete for other missions to support PWSA for capabilities like launch or on-orbit transport. Firefly, for example, touted in a statement its forthcoming Elytra orbital transfer vehicle as a product that could support the SDA’s objectives. Other companies also commended the SDA for the development of the program.
“This selection underscores our commitment to innovation in space technology and our readiness to support SDA’s mission of enhancing national security through advanced space capabilities,” said CesiumAstro’s VP of business development, Trey Pappas.
The 19 companies selected via the program include venture-backed startups like Apex, Capella Space, CesiumAstro, Firefly Aerospace, Impulse Space, LeoStella, Momentus, Muon Space, SpaceX, and Turion Space. Airbus, AST SpaceMobile, Astro Digital, Geneva Technologies, Kepler Communications, Kuiper Government Solutions, NovaWurks, Terran Orbital, and York Space Systems were also selected.
The Space Development Agency has already awarded hundreds of millions in contracts to private companies to help establish a missile tracking and communications satellite constellation in low Earth orbit. Programs like HALO are to help nontraditional defense contractors compete for these potentially lucrative awards. The SDA anticipates to award multiple contracts to vendors in the HALO program, the agency said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/bessemer-index-and-a16z-alum-launch-vc-firm-chemistry/,"Bessemer, Index, and a16z alum launch VC firm Chemistry | TechCrunch",Rebecca Szkutak,2024-10-23,"New VC firm Chemistry raised $350 million for its debut fund, Forbes reported on Wednesday.
The firm was launched by Mark Goldberg, former partner at Index Ventures; Kristina Shen, former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz; and Ethan Kurzweil, former partner at Bessemer (pictured above in that order). Axios first reported in April that the three were looking to launch a fund together.
Chemistry’s debut fund was 2x oversubscribed, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.
The firm will invest in early-stage startups mainly at the Series A stage, but also seed, across categories including fintech, infrastructure, and developer tools and work software. Each partner plans to invest in two to three deals a year.
“All three of us will actively support each investment,” the firm’s blog post read. “We are the portfolio services team, working in the trenches with our founders.”
In previous roles, the partners have backed notable companies, including LaunchDarkly, Plaid, and Twitch, among others."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/booxs-phone-size-e-reader-gets-faster-processing-and-a-fingerprint-reader/,Boox’s phone-size e-reader gets faster processing and a fingerprint reader | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-23,"In 2023, Boox turned heads with the Palma. The device blurred the line between e-readers and smartphones, by combining e-paper with Android. The initial pitch was something along the lines of a phone-sized Kindle that’s small enough to slip into a pocket.
The product would be enticing for many if that were the only thing it brought to table. I say this as someone who has taken his Kindle with him on the subway, only to awkwardly hang on to it for the rest of the night — and hopefully avoid leaving it behind. The idea of a pocketable e-reader is very appealing.
It’s clear, however, that Boox has larger ambitions with the line. On Wednesday, it referred to the forthcoming Palma 2 as “Mobile ePaper for a Mindful Lifestyle.” Hyperbolic market speak aside, Boox appears to envision the product as a kind of productivity device with limited distractions.
It’s a hard line to walk, building a “mindful” work device. In this case, it means a 6.13-inch 300 PPI E Ink display with 6GB of RAM and 12GB of storage. The device gets a speed bump with a new octa-core processor and a fingerprint reader for added security. Presumably the latter is handy if you’re using the device for more than airport reads.
The Android device has access to Google’s Play Store, further blurring the smartphone line. There are also a pair of speakers and a 16-megapixel camera designed specifically for scanning documents.
The device is currently up for preorder at $280, which puts it in the general price range for e-readers."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/tesla-cybertruck-pushes-past-ford-mach-e-to-become-third-best-selling-ev-in-america/,Tesla Cybertruck pushes past Ford Mach-E to become third best-selling EV in America | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-23,"Tesla’s Cybertruck was the third best-selling electric vehicle in the United States in the third quarter, beating out every other EV not made by Tesla. The only two vehicles that sold better were the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV.
The polarizing truck notched this achievement despite selling at its most expensive trim model in the early going. It’s also a sign of just how much trouble major automakers like Ford and General Motors have run into in finding customers for their own EVs.
Automotive research firm Kelley Blue Book pegged Tesla’s Cybertruck sales as third-best last week, notching over 16,000 sales.
Ford only sold around 7,000 F-150 Lightnings in the third quarter, and just over 13,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs, according to sales data from the automaker. GM has seemingly found some early success with its new Blazer and Equinox EVs, but still only sold around 32,000 electric vehicles total last quarter. Rivian only delivered around 3,800 of its own electric pickup.
Tesla confirmed the third-best accomplishment Wednesday when it released its financial results for the third quarter. Tesla also noted that the Cybertruck generated a positive gross margin — a measure of profitability that is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from revenue.
Tesla also revealed it generated $25.2 billion in sales during the quarter and notched a $2.2 billion profit. Tesla’s profit was boosted by $739 million in sales of regulatory credits to other automakers — the second-highest amount it’s ever sold in a quarter, behind the second quarter of this year when it sold $890 million worth. Tesla said its profits were also boosted by the fact that it started shipping its Actually Smart Summon feature and its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software to Cybertruck owners, which allowed the company to recognize some of the money owners paid up front as revenue.
Tesla’s relentless cost-cutting also plays into its profit figure. Tesla said in the shareholder letter that the cost of goods sold per vehicle is down to $35,100.
Those Q3 figures helped push Tesla’s stock price up more than 9% in after-hours trading.
Cost-cutting isn’t helping every part of the business, though. Tesla reported a 20% year-over-year growth in Supercharger stations, its slowest growth figure in years. This comes after Tesla gutted — and then started rehiring some of — its Supercharger team earlier this year as part of a massive company-wide layoff."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/devialet-updates-its-high-end-audio-amplifier/,Devialet launches new high-end audio amplifier | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-10-23,"Devialet, the French company at the intersection of audio engineering and luxury, is known for its egg-shaped Phantom speakers, but the company’s first product was in fact an audio amplifier that you could connect to stand-alone speakers.
After releasing soundbars, portable speakers, wireless earbuds, the venture-backed company is now going back to its roots with a new amplifier — the Devialet Astra.
“With these new technologies, you’re in the sound. This used to be reserved to professional studios, but now you can have it at home,” Devialet’s newly appointed CEO, Jacques Demont, said at a press conference.
However, chances are you’re not going to spot an Astra at your friend’s home anytime soon. Devialet’s amplifier remains a luxury item, with the base model retailing at €16,000 (around $17,300 at today’s exchange rates).
The new product comes just a few days after French business magazine Challenges reported that Devialet was short on cash. Over the past few years, in addition to traditional equity rounds, Devialet has secured debt facilities, and according to Challenges, the company is trying to find an agreement with its main creditors to raise a new round and pay back some of its creditors.
Coming back to the product, the Devialet Astra is relatively thin for an audio amplifier. It has a brushed aluminum casing with an art deco-inspired lined design around the edges, and features a small rounded screen on the top. You also get a wireless remote.
When it comes to specifications, the Devialet Astra packs a preamplifier, an amplifier, a DAC, a streamer, and a phono stage. A single Astra can drive speakers at 2 x 300W power under 4Ω — you can pair two Astra amplifiers together.
The Devialet Astra also takes advantage of some of the company’s proprietary technologies. For instance, Devialet claims it can reach high audio volumes with low distortion. The company has also put together a database of 1,200 different speakers so that the amp can tweak its audio signal to sound better with your speakers.
In addition to good old wires, Astra supports AirPlay, Google Cast, Roon Ready, Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect, and UPnP via WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3.
Devialet is also introducing a new software stack that will serve as the base for all future Devialet products. Let’s hope these upcoming products come sooner rather than later so that Devialet can turn things around."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/beleaguered-startup-humane-drops-ai-pin-price-by-200/,Beleaguered startup Humane drops Ai Pin price by $200 | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-23,"Humane on Wednesday announced a $200 price cut to its flagship product, the Ai Pin. The Bay Area startup, founded by two former Apple executives, has reportedly struggled to sell the product, which launched in April for $700.
In a message sent to its email list, Humane highlights its return policy in the new pitch. “Ai Pin starts at $499 and includes your first month of Humane Plan on us,” the company writes. “Along with a 90-day return window, it’s completely risk-free to try.”
The device was poorly received by reviewers. By August, returns of the Ai Pin had reportedly begun to outpace sales, leaving some 7,000 to 8,000 devices in the hands of users.
The company reportedly began exploring a sale in May, amid poor reviews and poorer sales."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/phillys-portal-is-like-social-media-come-to-life/,Philly's Portal is like social media come to life | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-10-23,"For once, the biggest tourist attraction in Philadelphia’s Love Park isn’t the iconic artwork that gives the plaza its name. While a couple of tourists trickle through to take pictures with the love sculpture, the main attraction this week is the Portal, which was encircled by a crowd of about 50 onlookers when it made its debut Tuesday.
The Portal, which stands almost 12 feet tall and weighs 3.5 tons, is an always-on live video feed housed in a futuristic, industrial-style circle, connecting two cities from around the world. A project of Lithuanian entrepreneur Benediktas Gylys, the Portal made international headlines this summer when someone at New York City’s Portal flashed the city of Dublin, Ireland. The Portal was shut down temporarily and then was relocated by September.
When the Portals project announced that its newest installation would come to Philadelphia, locals had concerns. This is a city that has to grease the light poles when its sports teams are in the playoffs so that people don’t climb them; a city that created Gritty, a chaotic orange trash monster as the official mascot of the NHL team Philadelphia Flyers, and the Phillie Phanatic, the most sued mascot in sports; a city where someone will post a Craigslist missed connection to make sure you know they gave you the finger for driving a Cybertruck. If midtown Manhattan was too salacious for the Portal, what will the people of Philadelphia — who infamously once threw snowballs at Santa Claus — have up their sleeves?
Before the Portal even activated, the screen cracked, but it wasn’t vandalism. It was an installation error — a false start. And yet, when it finally opened, the environment around the Portal on its first day was eerily wholesome. Maybe too wholesome. I was at the Portal when a nearby high school let out for the day, and even those teenagers didn’t create a ruckus (though some of them insist on using Love Park to practice their bike tricks — which are dangerous — but maybe we can pin this on Tony Hawk since there’s a Love Park course in the “Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater” games). Standing around the installation for about 30 minutes, only one person crossed the line when he gave the finger to a guy in Dublin.
The Portal itself is like the internet come to life. You can instantly connect with people across the world, as well as strangers in your own city, but that means it also mirrors some of the worst parts of our lives online. A few bad apples can ruin the experience for everyone, but unlike the internet, people are more effective at moderating themselves in person. The guy who stuck his middle finger up at the Portal was booed by the crowd and left. When people violate social norms online, it’s a lot easier to lurk undetected, wreaking havoc in the shadows.
Gylys, the entrepreneur who created the Portals, started the project after realizing that his success in the Lithuanian startup sphere still left him feeling unfulfilled in his life.
“After developing several online ventures I had success symbols to show and a painful lack of meaning to hide,” Gylys wrote. “Finally surrendering and sincerely admitting that I do not know anything about reality led me to a mystical experience where I felt oneness with all life on Earth for two weeks.”
Dubious “mystical experience” aside, Gylys’ goal is straightforward: He wants to help people connect with one another, helping us to realize that we aren’t as different as we seem.
Gylys’ background working on consumer apps in Lithuania comes in handy because it’s a technological feat in itself that the Portal can even operate. The underlying software was devised by Video Window, which uses the same always-on video feeds for its main product, which is much less glamorous: It connects remote workers so they feel like they’re in the office (or, maybe, they just feel surveilled).
Not only is Video Window responsible for making sure the video streams run without tech issues, but the company also has to make sure that the Portals don’t get hacked. On-site at the Portal, everything ran smoothly — the video feed switched every few minutes, showing scenes from Ireland, Poland, and Lithuania without any technical strain.
At about 3 p.m. in Philadelphia, these European Portals showed us people walking home from a long day at work or a weeknight out. In Dublin, some passersby would stop — beer bottles in hand — and dance for the camera. One older man pretended to do a strip tease, but thankfully kept things PG and only took off his jacket. Meanwhile, in Lithuania, where it was snowing at 10 p.m., no one wanted to stop and say hi. When the Portal switched from Ireland to Lithuania, everyone groaned, since we briefly lost our source of entertainment. (I’m sure the people of Vilnius are more friendly when they aren’t trudging home in the cold.)
You can see through the Portal, but you can’t hear, so we communicate through gestures. The novelty must have worn off already abroad — these Portals have existed for a few years, though the addition of a new city to the mix likely made it more fun. One man in Poland timidly showed us some dance moves, and our horde of enthusiastic Philadelphians, experiencing the Portal for the first time, would mimic it back. For that guy, it must be like looking in a mirror, except the mirror is 50 people who are weirdly excited that you stopped to wave.
There’s a fundamental tension between Gylys’ goal and what it actually accomplishes. Gylys wants this to bring us together, but the Portal doesn’t necessarily forge new friendships. As I waved to strangers in Ireland, Lithuania, and Poland, I was reminded of how we aren’t all that different, just as Gylys intended. But I also thought about how little we know about these people — what if the Polish dancer has horrific political views? What if the guy who made me laugh with his PG striptease actually runs an illegal underground gambling ring?
Philadelphia doesn’t have any obvious conflict with these three countries, but what would happen if the U.S. and Ireland suddenly ended up in some sort of heated international dispute? Would we all be as excited to wave hello across the Atlantic Ocean, or would the Portal end up facilitating expressions of international rivalry and discord? Some people at the Portal joked that all hell would break loose if we had a view of Dallas, Texas, home to the Cowboys, our biggest football rivals. (The next day, someone showed up with a sign that says “Dallas Sucks.”)
A day later, the Portal still seems to be doing okay. Philly Elmo — a guy in an Elmo costume who shows up at random city events with a drum line — stopped by in the evening, introducing confused Lithuanians to his antics. One man in Dublin wore a Philadelphia Eagles shirt, prompting the crowd on the other side of the Portal to cheer.
Just as the Portal reflects another city, it also reflects ourselves. While a couple of people are intent on using this technology to be rude, most visitors are happy to delight in a brief moment of connection with a total stranger on the other side of the pond. Maybe humans aren’t so bad after all — unless they’re Cowboys fans."

The move, reported by Bloomberg, would have an impact on a majority of smartphone manufacturers that rely on Qualcomm chips.
U.K.-based Arm, which licenses chip architecture, issued the notice as part of a protracted battle with the Snapdragon producer. Much of the issue can be traced back to a dispute over contracts and trademarks that found Arm suing Qualcomm. Qualcomm returned with its own suit.
A spokesperson for the San Diego chipmaker told Bloomberg that the notice “appears to be an attempt to disrupt the legal process, and its claim for termination is completely baseless.”
Update: A spokesperson for Qualcomm tells TechCrunch, “This is more of the same from Aem – more unfounded threats designed to strongarm a longtime partner, interfere with our performance-leading CPUs, and increase royalty rates regardless of the broad rights under our architecture license. With a trial fast approaching in December, Arm’s desperate ploy appears to be an attempt to disrupt the legal process, and its claim for termination is completely baseless. We are confident that Qualcomm’s rights under its agreement with Arm will be affirmed. Arm’s anticompetitive conduct will not be tolerated.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/bookcase-can-turn-an-iphone-into-an-e-reader/,Bookcase can turn an iPhone into an e-reader | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-23,"Amazon made a big splash in e-reader land last week with the release of its first-ever color Kindle. When it comes to devoted e-readers here in the States, Amazon is very nearly the only game in town. Plenty have tried to knock the Kindle off its perch, but the brand maintains around 80% of the market.
Bookcase is not an e-reader, however. The latest bit of tech novelty from Astropad is a case that turns a smartphone into a book — or at least the approximate dimensions of one. It’s a bit of plastic that lets one hold a smartphone the way they would a Kindle.
The $50 ($40 at launch) price tag is steep, but Astropad has included a few related features to make Bookcase more than a hunk of plastic. Between the handles is a MagSafe mount, which works with iPhones and plenty of Android devices.
There’s also an NFC chip inside, which will trigger a “companion app” on a nearby phone. That doubles as kind of a bookshelf for various reading apps. It can also be used to trigger Do Not Disturb settings on compatible devices.
Bookcase is one of those strange products that fills a hole you never realized existed. It seems silly at first, but the more you think about it, the more you suspect that something like this could actually be kind of useful.
It’s a sentiment that applies to much of what Astropad does. The hardware firm hit the scene in 2017 with a solution that turned iPads into drawing tablets for Macs. The company made a bigger splash with Luna Display, which turned the tablet into a second screen — a feature Apple would soon Sherlock out of existence.
More recently, the company has trafficked in things like an iPad drawing stand and an add-on that mimics the sensation of drawing on paper. Bookcase fits right in with those offerings. It’s set to start shipping later this year."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/longtime-policy-researcher-miles-brundage-leaves-openai/,Longtime policy researcher Miles Brundage leaves OpenAI | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-23,"Miles Brundage, a longtime policy researcher at OpenAI and senior adviser to the company’s AGI readiness team, has left.
In a post on X on Wednesday and in an essay in his newsletter, Brundage said that he thinks he’ll have more impact as a researcher and advocate in the nonprofit sector, where he’ll have “more of an ability to publish freely.”
“Part of what made this a hard decision is that working at OpenAI is an incredibly high-impact opportunity, now more than ever,” Brundage said. “OpenAI needs employees who care deeply about the mission and who are committed to sustaining a culture of rigorous decision-making about development and deployment (including internal deployment, which will become increasingly important over time).”
With Brundage’s departure, OpenAI’s economic research division, which until recently was a sub-team of AGI readiness, will move under OpenAI’s new chief economist, Ronnie Chatterji. The remainder of the AGI readiness team — which is winding down — will be distributed among other OpenAI divisions, Brundage says. Joshua Achiam, head of mission alignment, will take on some of AGI readiness’ projects.
An OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company “fully supports” Brundage’s decision to pursue his policy research outside industry and is “deeply grateful” for his contributions.
“Brundage’s plan to go all-in on independent research on AI policy gives him the opportunity to have an impact on a wider scale, and we are excited to learn from his work and follow its impact,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re confident that in his new role, Miles will continue to raise the bar for the quality of policymaking in industry and government.”
The spokesperson didn’t say who will take over Brundage’s responsibilities.
Brundage joined OpenAI in 2018, where he began as a research scientist and later became the company’s head of policy research. Prior to OpenAI, Brundage was a research fellow at the University of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute.
On the AGI readiness team, Brundage had a particular focus on the responsible deployment of language generation systems such as ChatGPT. He led other initiatives elsewhere, including OpenAI’s external red teaming program and its first “system card” reports documenting AI model capabilities and limitations.
In recent years, OpenAI has been accused by several former employees — and board members — of prioritizing commercial products at the expense of AI safety. In his post on X, Brundage urged OpenAI employees to “speak their minds” about how the company can do better.
“Some people have said to me that they are sad that I’m leaving and appreciated that I have often been willing to raise concerns or questions while I’m here … OpenAI has a lot of difficult decisions ahead, and won’t make the right decisions if we succumb to groupthink,” he wrote.
OpenAI’s been shedding high-profile execs in recent weeks, the culmination of disagreements over the company’s direction. CTO Mira Murati, chief research officer Bob McGrew, and research VP Barret Zoph announced their resignations in late September. Prominent research scientist Andrej Karpathy left OpenAI in February; months later, OpenAI co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever quit, along with ex-safety leader Jan Leike. In August, co-founder John Schulman said he would leave OpenAI. And Greg Brockman, the company’s president, is on extended leave.
It’s been a rather unflattering day for OpenAI.
Wednesday morning, the company was the subject of a New York Times profile of former OpenAI researcher Suchir Balaji, who said he left the company because he no longer wanted to contribute to technologies he believed would bring society more harm than good. Balaji also accused OpenAI of violating copyright by training its models on IP-protected data without permission — an allegation others have made against the organization in class action lawsuits.

Wayve says it will start by testing a more limited version of its automated driving system — which is self-learning versus rules-based, similar to Tesla’s approach — before trying anything more advanced. That means test drivers will be zipping around the Bay Area with their hands off the wheel of a small fleet of kitted-out Mustang Mach-E EVs.
The expansion comes just a few months after a blockbuster $1 billion funding round for Wayve led by SoftBank Group and that also included Nvidia, Microsoft, and — a few months later — Uber. The company’s goal is to one day sell its “Embodied AI” not only to other automakers looking for a self-driving solution, but also to robotics companies."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/flock-safety-paid-over-300-million-for-17-month-old-drone-startup-aerodome/,Flock Safety paid over $300M for 17-month-old drone startup Aerodome | TechCrunch,Margaux MacColl,2024-10-23,"Last week, police surveillance startup Flock Safety announced that it had bought drone startup Aerodome. The acquisition price was over $300 million, according to sources in the venture world. The number has not been previously reported.
Both Flock Safety and Aerodome are backed by Andreessen Horowitz and have raised over $680 million and $28 million, respectively, according to PitchBook. Rahul Sidhu, a former police officer, founded Aerodome just 17 months ago, declaring it an “American Dynamism speed-run,” in reference to the name of a16z’s defense tech-focused initiative.
Sidhu also said the deal was “one of largest tech acquisitions” in public safety history. “Our acquisition isn’t the end of Aerodome, but the beginning of a golden era in public safety tech advancement,” he wrote.
Aerodome created technology that powers drones as first responders. Right now, many police drone programs require a human to pilot the drone, but drone companies like Skydio, Brinc Drones, and Aerodome are all trying to perfect an autonomous service. For example, when the police receive a 911 call, a drone could take off on its own and scope out the scene, informing police if the area is safe to enter.
Flock Safety has also zeroed in on law enforcement as a customer, building out cameras that can identify license plates and sensors that detect gunshots.
The acquisition accelerates Flock Safety’s aggressive expansion into police drones. Flock Safety announced it will be releasing its own drones over the next year and, according to Sidhu’s post, will be hiring an additional 100 engineers for the company’s aviation team.
The drone expansion plan puts the company in direct competition with drone manufacturer Skydio, which is yet another a16z portfolio company.
Garrett Langley, founder and CEO of Flock Safety, said the expansion into drones is a no-brainer. “Anyone who’s seen a drone-as-first-responder program in action knows that this technology will play a central role in the future of public safety,” he said in a company blog post. “No other technology helps law enforcement officers get eyes on the scene faster than a drone.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/this-week-in-ai-the-ai-agents-cometh/,This Week in AI: The AI agents cometh | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-23,"Hiya, folks, welcome to TechCrunch’s regular AI newsletter. If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here.
The agents are coming — the AI agents, that is.
This week, Anthropic released its newest AI model, an upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, that can interact with the web and desktop apps by clicking and typing — much like a person. It’s not perfect. But 3.5 Sonnet with “Computer Use,” as Anthropic’s calling it, could be transformative in the workplace.
At least, that’s the elevator pitch.
Whether Anthropic’s new model lives up to the hype remains to be seen. But its arrival signifies Anthropic’s ambitions in the nascent AI agent market, which some analysts believe could be worth close to $50 billion by 2030.
Anthropic isn’t the only one investing resources in developing AI agents, which, broadly defined, automate tasks that previously had to be performed manually. Microsoft is testing agents that can use Windows PCs to book appointments and more, while Amazon is exploring agents that can proactively make purchases.
Organizations might be waffling on generative AI. But they’re pretty bullish on agents so far. A report out this month from MIT Technology Review Insights found that 49% of executives believe agents and other forms of advanced AI assistants will lead to efficiency gains or cost savings.
For Anthropic and its rivals building “agentic” technologies, that’s welcome news indeed. AI isn’t cheap to build — or run. Case in point, Anthropic is said to be in the process of raising billions of dollars in venture funds, and OpenAI recently closed a $6.5 billion funding round.
But I wonder if most agents today can really deliver on the hype.
Take Anthropic’s, for example. In an evaluation designed to test an AI agent’s ability to help with airline booking tasks, the new 3.5 Sonnet managed to complete less than half of the tasks successfully. In a separate test involving tasks like initiating a product return, 3.5 Sonnet failed roughly one-third of the time.
Again, the new 3.5 Sonnet isn’t perfect — and Anthropic readily admits this. But it’s tough to imagine a company tolerating failure rates that high for very long. At a certain point, it’d be easier to hire a secretary.
Still, businesses are showing a willingness to give AI agents a try — if for no other reason than keeping up with the Joneses. According to a survey from startup accelerator Forum Ventures, 48% of enterprises are beginning to deploy AI agents, while another third are “actively exploring” agentic solutions.
We’ll see how those early adopters feel once they’ve had agents up and running for a bit.
Data scraping protests: Thousands of creatives, including actor Kevin Bacon, novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, and the musician Robert Smith, have signed a petition against unlicensed use of creative works for AI training.
Meta tests facial recognition: Meta says it’s expanding tests of facial recognition as an anti-fraud measure to combat celebrity scam ads.
Perplexity gets sued: News Corp’s Dow Jones and the NY Post have sued growing AI startup Perplexity, which is reportedly looking to fundraise, over what the publishers describe as a “content kleptocracy.”
OpenAI’s new hires: OpenAI has hired its first chief economist, ex-U.S. Department of Commerce chief economist Aaron Chatterji, and a new chief compliance officer, Scott Schools, previously Uber’s compliance head.
ChatGPT comes to Windows: In other OpenAI news, OpenAI has begun previewing a dedicated Windows app for ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot platform, for certain segments of customers.
xAI’s API: Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, has launched an API for Grok, the generative AI model powering a number of capabilities on X.
Mira Murati raising: Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati is reportedly fundraising for a new AI startup. The venture is said to focus on  building AI products based on proprietary models.
Militaries around the world have shown great interest in deploying — or are already deploying — AI in combat zones. It’s controversial stuff, to be sure, and it’s also a national security risk, according to a new study from the nonprofit AI Now Institute.
The study finds that AI deployed today for military intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance already poses dangers because it relies on personal data that can be exfiltrated and weaponized by adversaries. It also has vulnerabilities, like biases and a tendency to hallucinate, that are currently without remedy, write the co-authors.
The study doesn’t argue against militarized AI. But it states that securing military AI systems and limiting their harms will require creating AI that’s separate and isolated from commercial models.
This week was a very busy week in generative AI video. No fewer than three startups released new video models, each with their own unique strengths: Haiper’s Haiper 2.0, Genmo’s Mochi 1, and Rhymes AI’s Allegro.
But what really caught my eye was a new tool from Runway called Act-One. Act-One generates “expressive” character performances, creating animations using video and voice recordings as inputs. A human actor performs in front of a camera, and Act-One translates this to an AI-generated character, preserving the actor’s facial expressions.
Granted, Act-One isn’t a model per se; it’s more of a control method for guiding Runway’s Gen-3 Alpha video model. But it’s worth highlighting for the fact that the AI-generated clips it creates, unlike most synthetic videos, don’t immediately veer into uncanny valley territory.
AI startup Suno, which is being sued by record labels for allegedly training its music-generating tools on copyrighted songs sans permission, doesn’t want yet another legal headache on its hands.
At least, that’s the impression I get from Suno’s recently announced partnership with content ID company Audible Magic, which some readers might recognize from the early days of YouTube. Suno says it’ll use Audible Magic’s tech to prevent uploads of copyrighted music for its Covers feature, which lets users create remixes of any song or sound.
Suno has told labels’ lawyers that it believes songs it used to train its AI fall under the U.S.’ fair-use doctrine. That’s up for debate. It wouldn’t necessarily help Suno’s case, though, if the platform was storing full-length copyrighted works on its servers — and encouraging users to share them."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/image-playground-chatgpt-and-more-apple-intelligence-features-roll-out-in-beta/,"Image Playground, ChatGPT, and more Apple Intelligence features roll out in beta | TechCrunch",Brian Heater,2024-10-23,"Apple on Wednesday rolled out the latest developer beta release of its top operating systems, including iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2. The releases arrive a week prior to the public launch of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 — though Apple has yet to specify a day.
Next week’s arrivals mark the first time Apple Intelligence features will be available to the public in a non-beta form. These include integrated writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for the redesigned Siri experience.
Those braver souls currently enrolled in the developer beta program will get access to a number of additional Apple Intelligence features that were unveiled in June at the company’s annual WWDC event. These features include Genmoji, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence, Image Wand, and ChatGPT integration.
First-time Apple Intelligence users will be required to opt in to the feature through Settings. Users will also be required to give permission to enable ChatGPT functionality. The third-party generative AI platform is being integrated in two keys: answering questions through Siri and as a compositional tool located within Writing Tools.
The Siri option surfaces when the assistant is asked a question for which it can’t find immediate answers. When this occurs, the system will ask permission to access OpenAI’s platform. Recipes and trip planning are two common features that will likely trigger the function.
Compose, meanwhile, is integrated into all apps with access to Writing Tools (and first-party and many third-party apps). Much as they would through the stand-alone ChatGPT platform, users enter a prompt and the service writes text. These apps will have access to ChatGPT’s image generation platform as well.
That’s in addition to Apple’s own image generation, of course. Image Playground, which is built into Apple apps like Messages, Pages, Keynote, and Freeform (as well as its own stand-alone app), utilizes prompts to generate new images. Prompts include concepts, descriptions, and character creations. Users can also use friends and family as prompts or generate images based on their own photos.
Image Playground is trained on licensed content, as well as publicly crawled websites. Publishers have an option to opt out of the latter. Apple’s art appears in two primary styles: animation and illustration. Both intentionally avoid photo realism, likely to avoid potential ethical and legal issues that can emerge from faked photos.
Image Wand, meanwhile, lets users turn their own sketches into finished artwork. It can also clean up handwritten notes.
Genmoji, which rolls out Wednesday as part of the iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 developer updates, brings the ability to generate original emojis with prompts. These include descriptions, people recognized from your photos, and custom characters. Those can be used inline in Messages, as well as with Stickers and Tapbacks.
Visual Intelligence is essentially Apple’s answer to Google Lens. Accessible through the iPhone 16’s Camera Control button, the feature can scan QR codes, copy and summarize text, detect phone numbers and email addresses (and add them to Contacts), and translate language. The feature will also deliver contextual information of images in front of it, including restaurant reviews and store hours.
Visual Intelligence can also tap into Google’s knowledge base for shopping queries and can access ChatGPT for information about different subjects.
Users don’t need a ChatGPT account to access the platform, though without one their queries will be limited."

The integration arrives alongside other Apple Intelligence features, including Genmoji, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence, and Image Wand.
The public will get its first access to Apple Intelligence features like integrated writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for the redesigned Siri experience courtesy of the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and 15.1 releases. They will, however, have to wait for future updates for access to OpenAI’s platform.
Users will have to opt in to both Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT individually, either during the setup process or later in settings. They won’t need to have a ChatGPT account or the stand-alone app. Without a premium account, however, the number of queries they access will be limited, though everyone will have access to all of OpenAI’s models, including GPT-4.
The service will fill two primary functions: supplementing Siri’s knowledge base and generating text within Writing Tools. With the service enabled, certain questions will prompt the new Siri to ask the user to approve its accessing ChatGPT. Recipes and travel planning are examples of questions that may surface the option. Users can also directly prompt Siri to “ask ChatGPT.”
Compose is the other primary ChatGPT feature available through Apple Intelligence. Users can access it in any app that supports the new Writing Tools feature. Compose adds the ability to write content based on a prompt. That joins existing writing tools like Style and Summary.
The feature also delivers access to Open AI’s image generation. That joins Apple’s new Image Playground feature, which allows users to generate images with prompts in a pair of styles. Genmoji does the same for emojis inside the Messages app."

The platform will arrive on an unspecified date next week, as part of the public versions of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1. Most rumors have pegged a Monday debut for those operating system upgrades.
Pieces of Apple Intelligence have been available to those running the developer beta versions of the aforementioned operating systems. These include integrated writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for the redesigned Siri experience.
Apple on Wednesday began rolling out the developer versions of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2. These updates will bring an additional list of Apple Intelligence updates, including Genmoji, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence, Image Wand, and ChatGPT integration.
A limited number of devices will be capable of running the generative AI features, a fact that Apple chalks up to hardware limitations. Apple Intelligence requires one of the following: iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, all iPhone 16 models, iPads with an A17 Pro chip (including the new iPad Mini) or M1 and later, or a Mac with an M1 or later.
After downloading the software update, users will have to opt in to using Apple Intelligence either on setup or later in Settings. They will then be placed on a “wait list.” Most requests should go through within a few hours. The purpose of the list is essentially for Apple to get its servers in a row, as certain queries require off-device processing."

Along with those updates comes APIs for three key Apple Intelligence features: Writing Tools API, Genmoji API, and Image Playground API. All are designed to help developers integrate Apple’s small model approach to generative AI into their apps.
Wednesday’s developer updates also expand language localization — though only for English. In addition to U.S. English, Apple has added Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, South African, and U.K. localizations.
Apple previously announced that support for Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will arrive next year. Notably, users in both China and the EU may not get any access to Apple Intelligence features, owing to regulatory hurdles."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/duckduckgo-will-be-making-more-early-stage-investments-in-privacy-focused-startups/,DuckDuckGo will be making more early-stage investments in privacy-focused startups | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-23,"DuckDuckGo, the privacy-focused search alternative to Google, wants to put money into startups that have a similar focus on privacy.
The company says that it’s actively seeking startups looking for investment, or startups that might be interested in partnering up or being acquired. In a blog post today, the company name-checked its SVP of finance, Mike Marino, and director of corporate and business development, Diana Chiu, as points of contact for those interested.
DuckDuckGo writes:
For early-stage investments, we are flexible on deal structure, aim to move quickly and are happy to co-invest with other companies, funds, and individuals. For acquisitions, we are open to a range of companies that share a commitment to protecting user privacy.
Founded in 2008, DuckDuckGo is the handiwork of CEO Gabriel Weinberg (pictured above) who funded the company himself for the first three years before landing its first external cash injection in 2011. In the intervening years, DuckDuckGo attracted some $180 million in external investment (a fair chunk of which came from the secondary market), with backers including Tiger Global, Union Square Ventures, and individuals such as WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton and web-inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
DuckDuckGo, which says it has been profitable since 2014 and has had more than $100 million in annual revenue since at least 2021, positions itself as the antithesis of Google, monetizing through ads based only on the content of keyword searches rather than user data. It also makes money through “non-tracking” affiliate partnerships with the likes of Amazon and eBay. More recently, the company has expanded further beyond search, offering subscription bundles that include features such as a VPN.
While DuckDuckGo has historically donated to privacy-focused nonprofits such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the Signal Foundation, and The Markup, it has quietly been taking a more capitalistic approach to how it supports organizations that align with its own goals. Last month, the company joined a $50 million funding round into generative AI search company You.com, alongside big-name backers such as Nvidia and Salesforce Ventures.
Part of DuckDuckGo’s newly launched Privacy Pro bundle also includes a personal information removal service, whereby it scans data broker sites to find personal data and requests removal on the user’s behalf. As things transpired, this service was powered by a startup called Removaly, which DuckDuckGo had quietly acquired back in 2022.
A DuckDuckGo spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company has invested in six startups over the past three years, though would only name You.com, Removaly, and one hitherto unknown one — an AI model training platform called EverArt.
While consumer privacy tech will be a large focus for its investments, DuckDuckGo also said it will be investing in companies focused on “search and browse,” as well as “emerging technologies” like generative AI. Indeed, its recent investment in You.com checks all these boxes, as it offers a “zero-trace” private search mode that You.com claims is “even more private than DuckDuckGo.”
So while DuckDuckGo has been dabbling in the VC and M&A domains already, it’s now doubling down on these efforts by actively requesting that suitable startups reach out.
As with other corporations with investment off-shoots, from big guns such as Google through smaller tech companies like Twilio and Workday, DuckDuckGo will be investing from its balance sheet — that’s where its profitability and annual revenues come into play. But given that it’s still a relatively small private company in its own right, it won’t be joining megabucks pre-IPO funding rounds — this is all about early-stage investments.
“This is the first time we’ve talked about our investments and the overall strategy around it directly,” the spokesperson continued. “We wanted to make this announcement to formalize this work that has been happening behind the scenes for a while, and signal to startups, potential partners, and the larger tech community that our door is open to anyone who wants to work with us on a more private Internet.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/google-releases-tech-to-watermark-ai-generated-text/,Google releases tech to watermark AI-generated text | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-23,"Google is making SynthID Text, its technology that lets developers watermark and detect text written by generative AI models, generally available.
SynthID Text can be downloaded from the AI platform Hugging Face and Google’s updated Responsible GenAI Toolkit.
“We’re open-sourcing our SynthID Text watermarking tool,” the company wrote in a post on X. “Available freely to developers and businesses, it will help them identify their AI-generated content.”
So how does SynthID Text work, exactly?
Given a prompt like “What’s your favorite fruit?,” text-generating models predict which “token” most likely follows another — one token at a time. Tokens, which can be a single character or word, are the building blocks a generative model uses to process information. A model assigns each possible token a score, which is the percentage chance it’s included in the output text. SynthID Text inserts additional info in this token distribution by “modulating the likelihood of tokens being generated,” Google says.
“The final pattern of scores for both the model’s word choices combined with the adjusted probability scores are considered the watermark,” the company wrote in a blog post. “This pattern of scores is compared with the expected pattern of scores for watermarked and unwatermarked text, helping SynthID detect if an AI tool generated the text or if it might come from other sources.”
Google claims that SynthID Text, which has been integrated with its Gemini models since this spring, doesn’t compromise the quality, accuracy, or speed of text generation, and works even on text that’s been cropped, paraphrased, or modified.
But the company also admits that its watermarking approach has limitations.
For example, SynthID Text doesn’t perform as well with short text, with text that’s been rewritten or translated from another language, or with responses to factual questions. “On responses to factual prompts, there are fewer opportunities to adjust the token distribution without affecting the factual accuracy,” explains the company. “This includes prompts like ‘What is the capital of France?,’ or queries where little or no variation is expected, like ‘recite a William Wordsworth poem.’”
Google isn’t the only company working on AI text watermarking tech. OpenAI has for years researched watermarking methods, but delayed their release over technical and commercial considerations.
Watermarking techniques for text, if widely adopted, could help turn the tide on inaccurate — but increasingly popular — “AI detectors” that falsely flag essays and papers written in a more generic voice. But the question is, will they be widely adopted — and will one organization’s proposed standard or tech win out over others?
There may soon be legal mechanisms that force developers’ hands. China’s government has introduced mandatory watermarking of AI-generated content, and the state of California is looking to do the same.
There’s urgency to the situation. According to a report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency, 90% of online content could be synthetically generated by 2026, leading to new law enforcement challenges around disinformation, propaganda, fraud, and deception. Already, nearly 60% of all sentences on the web may be AI-generated, per an AWS study — thanks to the widespread use of AI translators.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/promise-bio-exits-stealth-backed-by-pfizer-and-astrazeneca/,Promise Bio exits stealth backed by Pfizer and AstraZeneca | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-10-23,"The first thing Promise Bio CEO Ronel Veksler wants you to know about the biotech company he co-founded is that it’s not another AI drug discovery company. Instead, he’s looking to bring precision medicine to autoimmune diseases.
Tel Aviv-based Promise Bio has developed a cloud-based AI platform that can spot different Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) in proteins from a single blood sample. Before Promise’s tech, checking for one of these 200 protein modifications would require individual, separate tests. These PTMs are key to diagnosing and treating diseases like autoimmune disorders.
“It’s so substantial, it’s like moving from a black and white TV, to now seeing colors,” Veksler told TechCrunch. “You are seeing the same protein but in a completely different way.”
Having an easier way to test for these protein modifications could unlock the ability for precision medicine for autoimmune diseases in the same way that advancements in genomics allowed for precision treatment for cancer patients, Veksler said.
“When I practiced medicine, when you meet people with autoimmune diseases, these patients are under a constant race toward finding the best medication for them,” Veksler said. “It’s a series of trial and error which just doesn’t make sense when you have computational abilities these days.”
Veksler described his journey to Promise Bio as a number of pieces falling into place. After getting a medical degree and working as a physician for a few years, he got his PhD in the intersection of medicine and engineering before the pandemic. After stints as a physician, and at a friend’s startup, C2i Genomics, he knew he wanted to do something involving software, precision medicine, and autoimmune disorders.
His wife, Gal Noyman-Veksler, a partner at VC LionBird, came home one day in 2021 and told him that she had met Yifat Merbl, a senior scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel who was looking to spin out the computational biology tech she was working on.
Veksler described the scenario as a “perfect fit.” Alongside Assaf Kacen, co-founder and CTO, Promise Bio was formally founded in January 2023 and has been operating in stealth ever since. The company is already working with multiple large hospitals in the U.S. and Israel, as well as drug companies, including AstraZeneca and Pfizer.
Promise Bio is now emerging from stealth with a previously undisclosed $8.3 million seed round in tow that closed in April 2023. The majority of the capital came from lead investor Awz Ventures in addition to strategic investors AstraZeneca and Pfizer. The company is using the funds to hire more people for its team and toward building a database of the PTM data points the company is gathering in its tests to be used for future research and development.
Roni Alsheich, a general partner at Awz Ventures, told TechCrunch that he’s really bullish on Promise Bio’s team, jokingly adding that it’s a very promising company. He added that the traction the company has been able to get thus far from legacy institutions like Pfizer and AstraZeneca is notable.
“If Pfizer is interested in this company, and AstraZeneca and researchers with these institutes and hospitals are interested in this company, we believe it is a real validation,” Alsheich said. “It’s only the beginning. I don’t know any other company with this age with so much traction with the [pharmaceutical] giants.”
Veksler said that Promise Bio has gotten inbound interest from researchers and drug developers targeting other conditions like neuro indications, but the team is focused on autoimmune disorders for now — which impact an estimated 4% of the global population.
“It’s really crazy that we are doing the same process as we were managing these diseases 15 years ago,” Veksler said. “The number of therapeutic options is only increasing. It’s not sustainable. We can not continue on this trial and error from pharma companies.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/wiz-hopes-to-hit-1b-in-arr-in-2025-before-an-ipo-after-turning-down-googles-23b/,"Wiz hopes to hit $1B in ARR in 2025 before an IPO, after turning down Google’s $23B | TechCrunch",Julie Bort,2024-10-23,"Wiz co-founder and VP of R&D Roy Reznik told CNBC last week that the company has hit $500 million in annual recurring revenue, and plans to double that in 2025 to $1 billion. He also reiterated that the $1 billion-mark is a prerequisite for the IPO that Wiz promised employees when it walked away from acquisition talks with Google last summer at a $23 billion price tag.
ARR at the cloud security startup was at about $350 million in May, but was already around $500 million by July when it walked from Google, TechCrunch reported at the time. In an email to employees after deal talks ended, Wiz’s CEO Assaf Rappaport told Wiz’s 1,200 employees that the company wanted $1 billion in ARR before an IPO. Back then, Wiz execs expected to hit the number in 2025. So to have Reznik double down last week is a good sign that Wiz is still growing as expected. A spokesperson also confirmed this ARR goal to TechCrunch.
Wiz was already experiencing fast growth, practically since its inception. In 2022, Wiz claimed to be the fastest startup to $100 million ARR ever, reaching that goal just 18 months after it launched in 2020.
Google’s offer also came right when Wiz was in a perfect position to weather turning it down. It had just raised $1 billion a few months earlier, in May, at a $12 billion valuation, led by Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Thrive Capital. Wiz called itself the world’s largest cyber unicorn at the time.
“We’ve already broken a few records as a private company, and we believe we can also break a few more records as an independent public company as well,” Reznik told CNBC last week, as he announced expansion in the U.K. with a London office. Reznik talked about the growth rate of cloud computing, and how global spending on cloud security is already at over $30 billion this year.  His implication was that Wiz still has a lot of room to grow.
Should Wiz achieve the $1 billion ARR number before attempting an IPO — and if its underlying financials are strong and indicate more potential growth — it could indeed have a record-breaking public debut. Back in 2020 Snowflake broke records for its IPO as the biggest software IPO ever, when shares closed the day at a $70 billion market cap. This was on fast-growing revenues of $265 million and a net loss of $348 million. Snowflake investors haven’t maintained that exuberance, but the company is still trading at around a $39 billion market cap.
In other words, Wiz still has reason to believe that it could indeed look back at a $23 billion offer in 2024 and sneeze."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/vcs-love-using-the-ai-meeting-notepad-granola-so-they-gave-it-20m/,"VCs love using the AI meeting notepad Granola, so they gave it $20M | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-10-23,"Granola’s notepad app has become a popular tool among venture capitalists who use it to record meetings and augment notes using AI technology. That made it easier for the startup to raise funds from a crowd of investors for its $20 million Series A — something the team managed to do in about a week.
“I think all the investors that we got term sheets from in the end had been using this for a while,” says Granola co-founder Sam Stephenson.
He says the team had received a lot of inbound interest, so they hosted roughly a dozen investor conversations in just one day. “It was a very opportunistic thing. We would have needed to do it at some point, but we were able to get good terms and get it over with very quickly.”
The company’s Series A was led by Spark Capital (Nabeel Hyatt) with participation from investors Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, Lightspeed, Betaworks, Firstminute Capital, and others.
Unlike some AI-powered meeting summary tools, Granola’s appeal is its collaborative approach. Instead of transcribing the meeting and then attempting to highlight the key points on its own, you can guide the AI by writing down what you think are the most important takeaways from your meeting, and the AI helps by filling in the rest.
To use Granola, you install the app on your Mac and connect it with your calendar. It will then transcribe your meeting’s audio directly when you meet over Zoom, Google Meet, Slack, Teams, and WebEx. During the meeting, you can write your own notes or bullet points, or leave it all up to the AI. After the meeting wraps, Granola analyzes who was in the meeting, and what it was about, and then uses AI to flesh out your notes using the meeting’s transcript. It can also clean up your typos if you jotted things down in a hurry.
Since launching in May, Granola has grown its user base by 5x and now sees around 5,000 people using the app on a weekly basis. Seventy percent of people who use Granola for a meeting within their first week of trying it return to use it again, according to the company. Weekly meetings have also grown by 6x.
And VCs are no longer its primary customers.
“[Over] 50% of all the users were in a leadership position, and investors were a smaller chunk than that,” Stephenson says. (The stat is now 57%, in fact.) “The tables have flipped, and we now definitely have more non-investors than investors.”
He says many are finding Granola through word-of-mouth — like founders hearing about it from their investors, for example — or from other peers in their industry. Later, they pass the word along to members of their team or within the company, which has been helping Granola grow.
Since its debut, Granola’s team has been adding new features, like integrations with Slack. They’re now working on CRM integrations and support for images. Soon, Granola will introduce a feature that will display the past meetings you’ve had with someone when you meet with them again, providing a sort of “context history” that can help jog your memory regarding what you last talked about.
The company also continues to swap out the off-the-shelf AI as better models become available, which is ongoing work. More recently, Stephenson says the AI has gotten better at sounding more natural and more like you had taken your own notes. (Granola is not training models on your meeting data for now, but it may introduce that in an opt-in basis further down the road.)
With the additional funds, Granola aims to make the app more of a product for teams, develop an enterprise pricing plan, and build features that could proactively find interesting nuggets and themes from a set of meetings over time. A mobile app will likely arrive next year, as well.
In addition, the investment allows Granola to expand its engineering team, now five, by hiring four more people.
Ahead of its Series A, Granola raised $4.25 million in seed funding from Michael Mignano at Lightspeed, along with Betaworks, Firstminute Capital, Mike Krieger, Soleio Cuervo, and others."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/tiktok-will-now-show-its-stem-feed-to-adults-not-just-teens/,"TikTok will now show its STEM feed to adults, not just teens | TechCrunch",Aisha Malik,2024-10-23,"TikTok announced on Wednesday that it’s bringing its STEM feed to all users in the United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland by default. Previously, the feed was only turned on by default for users under the age of 18.
The social network says the expansion will make it easier for people to find educational content on the app.
Although the feed will be enabled for all users in these countries by default, you can turn off the feed by going into the app’s settings and navigating to the “content preferences” section.
TikTok initially launched the STEM feed in response to criticism from lawmakers and rights groups who argue that TikTok is harmful to teens and uses addictive design practices to keep users engaged for as long as possible.
The company has been using the launch of the STEM feed to counter claims that TikTok is harmful for young users. TikTok CEO Shou Chew touted the feed while testifying in two separate U.S. congressional hearings, one in March 2023 and one in January 2024.
Given that TikTok has been criticized for being harmful to your mental health, regardless of whether you’re a teen or not, the company may be looking to counter these sorts of claims by expanding the STEM feed to adults as well.
The company says that the STEM feed provides a space for co-learning, inspiration, and enrichment. By displaying STEM content to users by default, TikTok is looking to market itself as a place for learning, not just doomscrolling.
TikTok says that since the STEM feed launched, the app has seen an 18% increase in STEM-related content and that videos in the feed have reached 200 million views. The company plans to expand local language support for the feed in the future."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/andreessen-horowitz-helps-founders-meet-compute-needs-with-oxygen-private-gpu-cluster/,Andreessen Horowitz is renting a bunch of Nvidia GPUs to its portfolio companies | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-10-23,"Andreessen Horowitz has a massive cluster of Nvidia H100 GPUs to help its portfolio of AI startups meet their compute needs, the venture capital firm confirmed for the first time on Wednesday. The program, called Oxygen, allows their portfolio companies to train or operate their AI models without negotiating market rates.
a16z’s Oxygen cluster gives startups some breathing room, so to speak, to compete against larger tech companies — such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft — in building large AI models. For the past several years, those companies have been engaged in a bidding war for GPUs, especially the AI industry-standard H100s, often winning deals by promising larger and longer contracts. That leaves a lot of AI startups out to dry, since they may not be able to take on the big contracts necessary to secure GPUs, whereas the OpenAIs and Anthropics of the world can.
“This started from a realization that a number of the AI founders we serve every day had a common problem: We were in the middle of a supply crunch, where Nvidia H100 capacity was in short supply,” said a16z partner Anjney Midha, who helped create the Oxygen program, in a podcast transcript shared with TechCrunch. “As startups, they were being deprioritized by the large clouds in favor of larger customers, which was really tough for them.”
The infrastructure is also a good way for a16z to attract new startups. Companies building AI models often need unfettered access to massive compute clusters for short training runs, but then, don’t need them once the models are trained. Inferencing AI models typically requires less compute than training, unless of course, usage of an AI model explodes. a16z’s Oxygen cluster offers startups flexibility, giving access to GPUs when they need it, without a long-term commitment to a cloud provider or huge cash outlay. Instead, they give a16z a stake in their business, in exchange for (among other things) low prices to rent GPUs.
But a16z isn’t the only investor promising startup founders GPUs, on top of financial capital and guidance, for stakes in their companies. Investing partners Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross offer their startups access to a 4,000 GPU cluster dubbed the Andromeda Cluster, according to Forbes. Y Combinator also offers startups a cluster of GPUs for training runs through partnerships with various cloud providers, most recently, Google Cloud.
An Andreessen Horowitz spokesperson declined to comment on how large the Oxygen cluster is, however, a16z may have the largest GPU war chest of any venture firm. The Information reported in July that Oxygen could contain more than 20,000 GPUs.
At one point in the podcast, Midha says the Oxygen cluster can relieve pressure on AI startups to fundraise at overpriced valuations in order to pay their compute bills. That’s another way Oxygen benefits a16z. Instead of investing more in a startup so it can buy GPUs from say, Microsoft, a16z can offer the GPUs themselves and invest at a lower price.
a16z views Oxygen as a core value proposition to its startups moving forward, as long as the AI boom continues as projected. That’s likely why the startup made the massive investment required to secure these chips.

To access the new discount, Prime members must first enroll in Earnify, a loyalty program utilized by BP and other BP-owned stations and convenience stores. Next year, Amazon intends to introduce a savings offer for electric vehicle charging with BP Pulse, BP’s electric vehicle charging business.
This new benefit is being rolled out four years after Walmart’s rival rewards program, Walmart+, provided its members with the opportunity to save 10 cents per gallon at more than 13,000 Exxon, Mobil, Murphy, and Walmart gas stations. Walmart’s Sam’s Club also offers fuel discounts as does Costco as a membership perk.
The gas discount is the most recent perk added to Amazon’s $14.99 per month Prime membership, which also includes free deliveries, Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Amazon Photos, Prime Reading, GrubHub+, and more."

According to The New York Times, Sewell Setzer III, a ninth grader from Orlando, spent months talking to chatbots on Character.AI’s AI role-playing app. Setzer developed an emotional attachment to one bot in particular, “Dany,” which he texted constantly — to the point where he began to pull away from the real world.
Setzer confessed having thoughts of suicide to the bot and messaged it shortly before his death.
This morning, Character.AI said it would roll out a number of new safety features, including “improved detection, response, and intervention” related to chats that violate its terms of service and a notification when a user has spent an hour in a chat.
As The Times writes, there’s now a booming industry of AI companionship apps — the mental health effects of which are largely unstudied."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/fixify-blends-automation-and-human-analysts-to-tackle-it-problems/,Fixify blends automation and human analysts to tackle IT problems | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-23,"Matt Peters has spent more than a decade working for cybersecurity vendors. He was a team lead at Check Point, climbed the corporate ladder to VP of worldwide operations at FireEye, and spent over four years at Expel, a managed detection and response firm, as chief product officer.
Peters says a surprising common thread ran through all these experiences: IT teams were frustrated because expectations around technology rarely matched up with reality.
Organizations demand a lot of their IT departments. According to one poll, nearly a third of staff at the average company bank on a response from IT within an hour. Roughly the same percentage expect help with any new tool that their employer requires they learn.
In these challenges, Peters perceived opportunity. Along with Peter Silberman and Mase Issa, both ex-Expel colleagues, Peters founded Fixify, an IT help desk platform with an automation twist.
Fixify connects to existing IT ticketing systems, like Jira and ServiceNow, to automatically categorize tickets and identify problem “hotspots.” Using AI, Fixify tries to identify the root causes of problems, then recruits IT analysts that it employs to diagnose and resolve the problems.
“Fixify is designed for tech-centric organizations between 100 and 2,000 employees that care about providing a high-quality IT help desk experience, but aren’t able to invest in the staff and tech stack required,” Peters said. “We charge an annual subscription based on the number of employees a customer has. For a company with 750 employees the cost would be $9,000 per month, or about the cost of one full-time help desk analyst.”
Peters says that Fixify uses a sentiment analysis tool to gauge the tone and urgency of incoming requests. This not only helps with triage, he says, but gives analysts an idea of what to expect and how to respond.
“By tracking sentiment from the start to the close of a ticket, we can monitor the user experience and quickly spot when extra attention is needed,” Peters added.
As analysts work through tickets, Fixify customers — and their own IT workers — can lend a hand if they choose. Fixify automatically updates ticket statuses to ensure stakeholders remain on the same page.
From Fixify’s admin dashboard, customers can specify which categories of tickets they want analysts to prioritize. They can also view performance metrics (e.g. time to resolution) and suggestions to proactively address issues, as well as file requests to delete sensitive info from Fixify’s platform. (By default, Fixify retains data for 12 months subject to “customer needs and contractual obligations.”)
“Our goal is to manage around three-quarters of the customer’s ticket volume from start to finish — not just re-route them,” he continued. “Our AI assists IT analysts by suggesting next steps based on each customer’s specific processes. They also identify relevant tools for each task by analyzing the ticket context and playbook instructions.”
IT teams have shown a willingness to embrace automation as they find themselves stretched thinner and thinner. In a December 2023 Digitate survey, 90% of IT decision-makers said they plan to deploy more automation, particularly in functions like finance and customer support, in the next 12 months.
The idea of high-tech IT outsourcing isn’t new. Several startups are trying the idea, including Primo (which focuses specifically on hardware), Fleet (which also has a hardware bent), and Wizeline.
But there’s lots of money in the segment. Avasant Research’s 2023 IT Outsourcing Statistics survey found organizations increased their annual IT outsourcing budgets by 8.1% last year. Deloitte projected total spending on IT outsourcing to reach $519 billion by 2023 — a 22% tick up from 2019.
Investors seem taken with Fixify’s automation angle — perhaps because of automation’s potential to boost productivity while lowering overhead.
This month, Fixify closed a $25 million Series A round co-led by Costanoa Ventures, Decibel Partners, and Paladin Capital Group, with participation from Scale Venture Partners. Mourad Yesayan, managing director at Paladin, plans to join Fixify’s board as part of the deal.
“The broader tech slowdown has actually created a couple of opportunities for us,” Peters said. “This Series A investment provides funding for the foreseeable future — and certainly through the expected uptick in the economy that many economists are predicting.”
Arlington, Virginia-based Fixify, which launched in 2023, has raised $32 million to date. The firm’s near-term focus is growing its 41-person workforce and customer base, which currently stands at 15 companies."

In Europe, Portuguese startup Sensei has been capitalizing on this momentum to grow its contactless store platform, and it has now raised €15 million (about $16.2 million) in a Series A funding round led by BlueCrow Capital.
Sensei says its system uses computer vision and AI-powered sensors to automatically update the store payment system with the contents of customers’ carts, and when they’re ready to check out, it will display a list of the items, all ready to be paid for.
“There’s two problems in the retail industry. The experience for customers sucks. Secondly, it’s very hard to process all of the sales information in real time,” said Vasco Portugal, CEO and co-founder of Sensei. “Now, it’s really about the automation of stores, like the automation of cars and the automation of factories. I think it’s a natural transition,” he added.
Portugal said the company has “been growing, especially last year.” With fresh cash in the bank, the startup is now aiming to have 1,000 fully autonomous points of sale by 2026. It has operations with clients in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and Brazil, and plans to expand into central and northern Europe.
The competition in the space is enormous. Other startups that have raised sizable rounds include Standard Cognition ($239.4 million), Trigo ($199 million), Grabango ($93.8 million), AiFi ($87.1 million), and Zippin ($44 million).
New investors Lince Capital, Explorer Investments, and Kamay Ventures (backed by Coca-Cola and Arcor Group) also participated in Sensei’s Series A, as did existing investors Metro AG and Techstars Ventures.
In 2021, Lisbon-based Sensei raised a seed round of $6.5 million (€5.4 million). Back then, the funding was led by Seaya Ventures and Iberis Capital, with participation from 200M Fund."

United Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time, instant payment system developed by the Indian government, and it processes more than 15 billion transactions a month, dominating India’s online payments landscape.
Walmart-owned PhonePe and Google Pay process about 87% of UPI transactions in the country, whereas Paytm’s market share has shrunk from 13% to 8% after the Indian central bank imposed restrictions on the company’s operations.
The Reserve Bank of India in March ordered Paytm to stop operating several businesses at its banking subsidiary, which the company used for UPI payments, citing repeated violations of rules.
NPCI, the regulatory body that oversees UPI, approved Paytm’s application to resume operations at the subsidiary on Tuesday.
Paytm this week reported revenue of $197.4 million in the second quarter ended September, a 34% decline from revenue of $299.5 million a year earlier."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/ro-ceo-zachariah-reitano-says-the-benefits-of-being-a-private-company-are-growing/,Ro CEO Zachariah Reitano says the benefits of being a private company are growing | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-10-22,"Ro co-founder and CEO Zachariah Reitano said while he’d “never say never” about potentially taking the 7-year-old telehealth company public, he thinks the benefits of being a private company are growing.
Reitano dodged multiple questions from Axios reporter Dan Primack about whether or not the company has plans to IPO in the near term — or in general — at Axios’ BFD event on October 22.
“I might give an unsatisfying answer, but the truth is that right now, we are exclusively focused on delivering the highest quality product for our patients,” Reitano said.
Ro has raised more than $1 billion in venture capital from the likes of General Catalyst, Initialized Capital, and Torch Capital, among many others. Ro most recently raised $150 million in a round led by ShawSpring Partners that valued the company at around $6.6 billion.
Reitano’s sentiment is likely one shared by other late-stage startup founders as venture-backed companies continue to stay private longer, according to PitchBook data. Another factor keeping companies private is the rise of the secondaries market as an increasingly common way to give investors and employees some liquidity — although the majority of activity surrounds a handful of companies.
He also talked about the company’s big “uncomfortable bet” on weight loss drugs that became available on the platform in 2023. Ro was founded in 2017 by Rob Schutz, Saman Rahmanian, and Reitano as a telehealth company focused on erectile disfunction. The company expanded to more men’s and women’s health categories, including hair growth, fertility and skin health. But it has now become well known as a provider of multiple GLP-1s options.Reitano said the company began developing the program to offer such drugs in 2021 and moved a significant percentage of its resources into the category at the time. It is now one of the fastest growing sectors of its business.
“Providers want patients to have it, and patients desperately want it. Those things have never happened in any drug category before, and so from our perspective, the prevalence and widespread usage of GLP-1s is inevitable,” Reitano said.
He added that the expansion was natural at the time for the company as conditions like obesity impact many of the other health categories the company focuses on, including fertility and sexual health conditions like erectile disfunction."

It accuses SoLo Funds of misleading consumers by advertising zero interest fees on loans yet encouraging “tip fees” and “donation fees” to obtain said loans. The complaint alleges these are hidden fees that the company makes hard to opt out of, making their loans more expensive than borrowers expected.
As TechCrunch previously reported, the company has been sued by Connecticut, California, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In May, the CFPB alleged the company used “digital dark patterns” to mislead consumers and illegally take fees, despite advertising there were no fees. SoLo Funds settled these earlier suits with all but the CFPB.
SoLo has raised at least $13 million, according to Crunchbase, from backers like Serena Williams, Alumni Ventures, and Techstars. SoLo Funds declined comment."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/evtol-startups-just-got-a-big-lift-from-the-us-government/,Feds clear way for EVTOL startups to bring flying vehicles to U.S. airspace | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-10-22,"Federal regulators have cleared the path for electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft to share U.S. airspace with planes and helicopters — a win for the burgeoning industry and a timely decision for startups like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation that are expected to launch air taxi networks commercially in 2025.
The Federal Aviation Administration published Tuesday its much-anticipated final ruling on the integration of “powered-lift” vehicles, a category the FAA revived two years ago to accommodate eVTOLs and one that describes aircraft that can take off and land like helicopters but then transition to forward flight like airplanes.
“Powered-lift aircraft are the first new category of aircraft in nearly 80 years and this historic rule will pave the way for accommodating wide-scale Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations in the future,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement. Whitaker announced the rule during the NBAA-Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition in Las Vegas.
The ruling also contains guidelines for pilot training and clarifies operating rules. For example, aside from a new type of powered-lift pilot certification, the ruling includes an expanded ability for operators to train and qualify pilots using flight simulation training devices.
The operating rules are tailored specifically to powered-lift vehicles and, as such, allow eVTOLs the flexibility to switch between helicopter and airplane rules as needed.
Joby, Archer, Beta Technologies, and Wisk Aero — which are building aircraft for urban air taxi networks, defense, cargo, and medical logistics — have worked closely with the FAA since 2022 to develop this new set of rules for training, operations, and maintenance.
“[The ruling] aligns with all the hopes that we had been designing for,” Greg Bowles, head of government affairs at Joby Aviation, told TechCrunch. “So the way that we’ve designed the operating system, the cockpit we’ve designed, the way we’ve designed for energy reserves, all align with the FAA rule.”
Bowles also noted that Joby will be able to begin commercial operations once it receives its type certification from the FAA, which means the design of the startup’s aircraft and other major aircraft components meet required safety and airworthiness standards. Joby is in the fourth of five stages of type certification, and recently received a $500 million capital injection from Toyota to help it get across the finish line."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/cement-startup-furno-lands-20m-grant-to-build-low-carbon-micro-kilns-in-chicago/,Cement startup Furno lands $20M grant to build low-carbon micro-kilns in Chicago | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-10-22,"Cement startup Furno will receive a $20 million grant from the Department of Energy, funds that will help the company build up to eight micro-kilns at a concrete plant in Chicago.
Chicago might not seem like the sort of place where cement is hard to come by. But with the nearest kiln 100 miles away, concrete companies have to pay handsomely for the stuff to keep up with demand. Furno’s micro-kilns promise to reduce pollution and eliminate transportation costs.
Furno’s partner in the project, Ozinga, currently buys 60,000 tons of cement annually from suppliers to use at its Chinatown Yard on Chicago’s south side. There, it blends the binder with aggregate to produce concrete that’s used in construction projects throughout the city.
Most cement plants are massive installations, requiring sprawling logistical networks to get the material to where it’s needed. But the new Furno project will be limited to the amount that Ozinga uses.
“We’ve sized our facility, the project, to that,” Furno founder and CEO Gurinder Nagra told TechCrunch. Nagra will be appearing onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 in San Francisco on October 28. “They have access to the virgin limestone as well as the recycled material already.”
To power the eight kilns that Mountain View-based Furno will be installing, Ozinga might use biogas, a form of methane produced by decomposing organic matter. That, along with the use of recycled material, stands to significantly reduce the climate impact of cement made at the facility.
Cement is one of the most polluting industries on the planet, generating 8% of all carbon pollution. It’s created when minerals that contain calcium, like limestone, are cooked under intense heat. This process, known as calcination, produces cement along with large amounts of carbon dioxide, over and above the pollution released by any fossil fuels that are used to generate the necessary heat. Every metric ton of cement produces 600 kilograms of carbon pollution.
Most cement today is produced in massive rotary kilns, which are essentially long, horizontal tubes through which heat and raw materials flow. They’re inefficient, with only about 30% of the heat being used for calcination; the rest is wasted.
Furno shrinks the kiln and turns it upright, a twist that allows more of the heat to participate in the calcination reaction, reducing fossil fuel pollution by at least 70% and eliminating it entirely when it’s fired using hydrogen.
The startup raised a $6.5 million seed round in March, TechCrunch exclusively reported. The federal grant will pay for a significant portion of the project. For the remainder, and to cover other expenses, Furno will be raising a Series A round starting in early 2025, said Kiersten Jakobsen, Furno’s head of marketing.
The deal with Ozinga, which Furno is calling Project Oz — a nod to both the project partner and to Nagra’s home country — will create 50 construction jobs and 30 permanent jobs. The Department of Energy was particularly interested in that statistic, Jakobsen said. “There were some coal plant closures, and the DOE grant is to bring back jobs for those people who had been displaced,” she said.
Furno wasn’t the only cement startup to receive an award from the Department of Energy. Terra CO2, which is based in Golden, Colorado, received $52.6 million to build a new manufacturing facility outside of Salt Lake City. The plant will crank out a cement replacement that’s significantly less polluting than the existing Portland cement."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/linkedin-confirms-the-follower-purge-was-just-a-bug-thats-now-resolved/,LinkedIn confirms the 'follower purge' was just a bug that's now resolved | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-10-22,"LinkedIn users on Tuesday began noticing a problem with their follower counts on the platform: They were dropping rapidly, and sometimes by many hundreds of users at once. With no official word at the time from LinkedIn, many began speculating that the situation was the result of LinkedIn purging fake accounts from the platform.
Some even spoke with authority on the matter, claiming that the problem was due to a decision by the company to clean out fake, inactive, or duplicate accounts. Others leveraged the opportunity to pitch their expertise in being able to help LinkedIn members from having their accounts “banned.” Still more questioned what they may have done wrong to see their accounts lose so much traction in such a short period of time.
Though the general consensus was that this was a purge enacted by LinkedIn, the company announced later in the day that it had looked into the issue and has now “resolved” the problem. It did not offer an explanation as to the cause.
“We heard some members may have seen a change in their connection and follower count,” the company wrote in a post on X. “Our team quickly looked into this. We’re happy to report this has now been resolved.”
Reached for comment, the company simply pointed us to its Status page where it documented on Tuesday at 6 a.m. ET that some members had been experiencing “issues with their follower and connection count” on LinkedIn, which it was still investigating later in the day. LinkedIn marked the problem as resolved Tuesday afternoon, at 1 p.m. ET.
Users’ idea that the issue was driven by a purge wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility. X has repeatedly run purges to remove spammers, bots, and inactive accounts from its platform, as do other social networks.
However, given that LinkedIn’s network is about building up your perceived relevance and clout in your industry, a follower drop could have been disastrous for those who rely on their profile to market themselves or their businesses, as well as those who do such work on behalf of their clients.
It’s worth noting that the incident blew up, in part, because LinkedIn didn’t acknowledge the problem on its own LinkedIn account or its X account, the latter of which hasn’t been updated since May of last year."

One Zero, a fintech startup with a lofty goal to “bring private banking to the masses,” is in the process of raising at least $100 million, TechCrunch has learned.
Founded by Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua, One Zero has not had as much attention outside of its home market of Israel, but the company has raised around $242 million so far. According to PitchBook data, the company was valued at $320 million in 2023 — and our sources say that the valuation will be significantly higher in the next round. While it’s unclear who is investing, previous backers include Tencent, OurCrowd, and SBI Ventures.
Apple Pay is celebrating its 10th birthday with easier ways to pay later. In addition to support for loan options from Affirm in the U.S. and Monzo Flex in the U.K., the company shared that support for Klarna will go live in those countries, with expanded loan options to come. The changes follow Apple’s decision to roll back plans for its own “buy now, pay later” service, Apple Pay Later.
There are a lot of tech tools for small businesses to choose from in order to make smart decisions, but Uprise is looking to simplify it all. The startup serves as a financial adviser for small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) by embedding itself into financial service products they already use and give companies recommendations of what they should do.
Indian stock trading and mutual fund startup Groww recently paid $159.4 million in taxes as it shifted its home base from the U.S. back to India. Nearly a dozen Indian startups are in the process of relocating their headquarters to better comply with Indian laws and facilitate IPOs in the country.
Stripe is in talks to acquire stablecoin platform Bridge for a whopping $1 billion, according to Forbes, as Stripe continues to make crypto a big priority for the company. The talks are reportedly in advanced stages, although nothing has been finalized.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/farewell-to-foursquares-app/,Farewell to Foursquare's app | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-10-22,"“I would be lying if I didn’t admit that I have been in a real funk these last few days over this news,” writes Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley, speaking about the company’s plan to sunset the Foursquare City Guide app later this year in favor of focusing on its check-in app Swarm. The move reverses Foursquare’s ambitious 2014 decision to split up its app into two different properties: one for exploration and discovery and the other, Swarm, for sharing your location to find nearby friends.
The Foursquare app’s closure, scheduled for December 15 of this year, isn’t surprising. It’s been a long time since Foursquare was talked about in the same breath as other social networks. When Foursquare launched, people were competing to become the “mayor” of their favorite venue and were less concerned about the safety issues of sharing their real-time location online.
Still, Foursquare’s original app had been a clever way to explore cities and their offerings, as an early example of how social networks could leverage smartphones’ location capabilities to build an entirely new type of experience.
Now that mass of collected data that fueled the company’s City Guide will disappear for its end users.
In an email sent to users, Foursquare writes, “After many wonderful years of leaving tips and reviews around the world together, we’ve made the tough decision to say goodbye to the City Guide app …” The app itself will shutter on December 15, with the web version to soon follow, the email noted.
The move prompted Crowley to become a bit nostalgic about what it’s like to say goodbye to a product he had worked on for so long.
In a post on Threads, the founder wrote, “I have a really good blog post somewhere in me about ‘the danger of falling in love with the companies you build & products you create,’ but it’s not the right time to write it. The ‘neglect of FSQ’s apps’ story [has] been a drumbeat in my personal online experience for like 5 years now and I let it affect [me] more than I should (aka: ‘dude, just get over it’ is easier said than done).”
While Foursquare the company continues to survive — Crowley notes it has over $100 million in revenue in his subsequent post — the focus of its efforts will now be on the check-in portion of the experience, not the City Guide.
He also takes the time to shout out the “old-school” Foursquare consumer product, engineering, and infrastructure teams for all their work over the years, as well as to the “super-user” community that kept the app going this long.
“I’m genuinely curious what FSQ (the company) is going to do [with] Swarm, and will always be rooting for the team and products,” Crowley added.
The founder is not the only one lamenting the shutdown. Other users and fans of Foursquare, both past and present, have posted how they feel about the app’s closure, describing it as a “gut punch,” “sad,” or simply offering their “RIP”-style condolences.
Josh Williams, who previously co-founded Foursquare’s main competitor, Gowalla, gave the app a nice send-off as well, remarking on how different the web used to be at the time these apps were mainstream.
“I know we can moan a lot about how the internet used to be fun and this and that, but there’s certainly a truth to it. Our quest for efficiency has robbed us of some joy,” Williams wrote on Threads. “I’m still convinced there are successful products to be made that connect people IRL, but it is a tough road to walk. Foursquare made the web and our digital lives a much better place,” he added.
Crowley is no longer involved with Foursquare in a full-time capacity but still remains co-chair of the company’s board. Instead, he has been working on “something new” since August, per LinkedIn."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/sec-fines-four-companies-7-million-for-misleading-cyber-disclosures-regarding-solarwinds-hack/,SEC fines four companies $7M for 'misleading cyber disclosures' regarding SolarWinds hack | TechCrunch,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-10-22,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Tuesday that it charged and imposed penalties on four companies for making misleading disclosures linked to the 2019 SolarWinds espionage attack.
The four companies charged are cybersecurity firms Check Point, which will pay a civil penalty of $995,000, and Mimecast, which will pay $990,000; and the tech companies Unisys, which will pay $4 million, and Avaya, which will pay $1 million.
All of these companies were victims of the hack that hit SolarWinds, which affected several other companies and government agencies that used SolarWinds software. According to the SEC, each company committed different violations that “negligently” downplayed and minimized the damage of the breaches.
“While public companies may become targets of cyberattacks, it is incumbent upon them to not further victimize their shareholders or other members of the investing public by providing misleading disclosures about the cybersecurity incidents they have encountered,” said Sanjay Wadhwa, acting director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Here, the SEC’s orders find that these companies provided misleading disclosures about the incidents at issue, leaving investors in the dark about the true scope of the incidents.”
According to the SEC, each company committed different violations. Avaya said hackers accessed a “limited number” of companies’ emails but did not say that the hackers also accessed “at least 145 files in its cloud file sharing environment.” Despite knowing about the breach, Check Point “described cyber intrusions and risks” in “generic terms.” Mimecast “minimized the attack by failing to disclose” what code and the quantity of company encrypted credentials that the hackers stole. And Unisys “described its risks from cybersecurity events as hypothetical” even though it was hit by two SolarWinds-related breaches.
The SEC said that all companies collaborated with its investigation and agreed to pay the penalties and “to cease and desist from future violations of the charged provisions,” while also not “admitting or denying” the SEC findings.
Avaya spokesperson Julianne Embry told TechCrunch that the SEC “recognized Avaya’s voluntary cooperation and that we took certain steps to enhance the company’s cybersecurity controls.”
Check Point spokesperson Gil Messing told TechCrunch that “Check Point investigated the SolarWinds incident and did not find evidence that any customer data, code, or other sensitive information was accessed. Nevertheless, Check Point decided that cooperating and settling the dispute with the SEC was in its best interest.”
Mimecast spokesperson Timothy Hamilton told TechCrunch that the company “made extensive disclosures and engaged with our customers and partners proactively and transparently, even those who were not affected,” in response to the SolarWinds hack.
“We believed that we complied with our disclosure obligations based on the regulatory requirements at that time,” Hamilton said.
When reached by TechCrunch for comment, Unisys spokesperson Jamie Baid declined to comment and referred to the company’s 8-K filing published on Tuesday. In the document, Unisys said it reached a settlement with the SEC that resolves the regulator’s investigation into the company.
In the last few years, the SEC has imposed a series of new obligations on publicly traded companies when it comes to disclosing data breaches, and their effects on the company and its customers and users."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/researchers-link-polyfill-supply-chain-attack-to-huge-network-of-copycat-gambling-sites/,Researchers link Polyfill supply chain attack to huge network of copycat gambling sites | TechCrunch,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-10-22,"One of the biggest digital supply chain attacks of the year was launched by a little-known company that redirected large numbers of internet users to a network of copycat gambling sites, according to security researchers.
Earlier this year, a company called FUNNULL purchased Polyfill.io, a domain hosting an open source JavaScript library that — if embedded in websites — can allow outdated browsers to run features found in newer browsers. Once in control of Polyfill.io, FUNNULL used the domain to essentially carry out a supply chain attack, as cybersecurity firm Sansec reported in June, where FUNNULL took over a legitimate service and abused its access to potentially millions of websites to push malware to their visitors.
At the time of the Polyfill.io takeover, the original Polyfill author warned that he never owned the Polyfill.io domain and suggested websites remove the hosted Polyfill code completely to avoid risks. Also, content delivery network providers Cloudflare and Fastly put out their own mirrors of Polyfill.io to offer a safe trusted alternative for websites that wanted to keep using the Polyfill library.
It’s unclear what the goal of the supply chain attack was exactly, but Willem de Groot, the founder of Sansec, wrote on X at the time that it appeared to be a “laughably bad” attempt at monetization.
Now, security researchers at Silent Push say they mapped out a network of thousands of Chinese gambling sites and linked it to FUNNULL and the Polyfill.io supply chain attack.
According to the researchers’ report, which was shared with TechCrunch in advance, FUNNULL was using its access to Polyfill.io to inject malware and redirect website visitors to that malicious network of casino and online gambling sites.
“It appears likely that this ‘online gambling network’ is a front,” Zach Edwards, a senior threat analyst and one of the researchers who worked on the Silent Push report, told TechCrunch. Edwards added that FUNNULL is “operating what appears to be one of the largest online gambling rings on the internet.”
Silent Push researchers said in their report that they were able to identify around 40,000 mostly Chinese-language websites hosted by FUNNULL, all with similarly looking and likely automatically generated domains made up of a scattering of seemingly random letters and numbers. These sites appeared to impersonate online gambling and casino brands, including Sands, a casino conglomerate that owns Venetian Macau, the Grand Lisboa in Macau, and SunCity Group; as well as the online gambling portals Bet365 and Bwin.
Chris Alfred, a spokesperson for Entain, the parent company of Bwin, told TechCrunch that the company “can confirm that this is not a domain we own so it appears the site owner is infringing on our Bwin brand so we will be taking action to resolve this.”
Sands, SunCity Group, Macau Grand Lisboa, and Bet365 did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Edwards told TechCrunch that he and his colleagues found a FUNNULL developer’s GitHub account, who discussed “money-moving,” an expression that they believe refers to money laundering. The GitHub page also contained links to Telegram channels that include mentions of the gambling brands impersonated in the network of spammy sites, as well as talk about moving money.
“And those sites are all for moving money, or is their primary purpose,” said Edwards.
The suspicious network of sites, according to Edwards and his colleagues, is hosted on FUNNULL’s content delivery network, or CDN, whose website claims to be “Made in USA” but lists several office addresses in Canada, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States, which all appear to be places with no listed addresses in the real world.
On its profile on HUIDU, a hub for the gambling industry, FUNNULL says it has “more than 30 data centers on the continent,” likely referring to mainland China, and that it has a “high-security automated server room in China.”
For an ostensible technology company, FUNNULL makes its representatives difficult to reach. TechCrunch made efforts to contact the company to seek comment and to ask it questions about its role in the apparent supply chain attack, but received no responses to our inquiries.
On its website, FUNNULL lists an email address that does not exist; a phone number that the company claims to be on WhatsApp, but could not be reached; the same number which on WeChat appears to be owned by a woman in Taiwan with no affiliation to FUNNULL; a Skype account that did not respond to our requests for comment; and a Telegram account that only identifies itself as “Sara,” and has the FUNNULL logo as her avatar.
“Sara” on Telegram responded to a request for comment — sent by TechCrunch in both Chinese and English — containing a series of questions for this article saying: “We don’t understand what you said,” and stopped answering. TechCrunch was also able to identify a series of valid FUNNULL-owned email addresses, none of which responded to requests for comment.
A company called ACB Group claimed to own FUNNULL on an archived version of its official website, which is now offline. ACB Group could not be reached by TechCrunch.
With access to millions of websites, FUNNULL could have launched much more dangerous attacks, such as installing ransomware, wiper malware, or spyware, against the visitors of the spammy websites. These kinds of supply chain attacks are increasingly possible because the web is now a complex global network of websites that are often built with third-party tools, controlled by third parties that, at times, could turn out to be malicious.
This time, the goal was apparently to monetize a network of spammy sites. Next time, it could be much worse.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/anthropics-new-ai-can-control-your-pc/,Anthropic's new AI model can control your PC | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-22,"In a pitch to investors last spring, Anthropic said it intended to build AI to power virtual assistants that could perform research, answer emails, and handle other back-office jobs on their own. The company referred to this as a “next-gen algorithm for AI self-teaching” — one it believed that could, if all goes according to plan, automate large portions of the economy someday.
It took a while, but that AI is starting to arrive.
Anthropic on Tuesday released an upgraded version of its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model that can understand and interact with any desktop app. Via a new “Computer Use” API, now in open beta, the model can imitate keystrokes, button clicks, and mouse gestures, essentially emulating a person sitting at a PC.
“We trained Claude to see what’s happening on a screen and then use the software tools available to carry out tasks,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. “When a developer tasks Claude with using a piece of computer software and gives it the necessary access, Claude looks at screenshots of what’s visible to the user, then counts how many pixels vertically or horizontally it needs to move a cursor in order to click in the correct place.”
Developers can try out Computer Use via Anthropic’s API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform. The new 3.5 Sonnet without Computer Use is rolling out to Claude apps, and brings various performance improvements over the outgoing 3.5 Sonnet model.
A tool that can automate tasks on a PC is hardly a novel idea. Countless companies offer such tools, from decades-old RPA vendors to newer upstarts like Relay, Induced AI, and Automat.
In the race to develop so-called “AI agents,” the field has only become more crowded. AI agents remains an ill-defined term, but it generally refers to AI that can automate software.
Some analysts say AI agents could provide companies with an easier path to monetizing the billions of dollars that they’re pouring into AI. Companies seem to agree: According to a recent Capgemini survey, 10% of organizations already use AI agents and 82% will integrate them within the next three years.
Salesforce made splashy announcements about its AI agent tech this summer, while Microsoft touted new tools for building AI agents yesterday. OpenAI, which is plotting its own brand of AI agents, sees the tech as a step toward super-intelligent AI.
Anthropic calls its take on the AI agent concept an “action-execution layer” that lets the new 3.5 Sonnet perform desktop-level commands. Thanks to its ability to browse the web (not a first for AI models, but a first for Anthropic), 3.5 Sonnet can use any website and any application.
“Humans remain in control by providing specific prompts that direct Claude’s actions, like ‘use data from my computer and online to fill out this form’,” an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch. “People enable access and limit access as needed. Claude breaks down the user’s prompts into computer commands (e.g. moving the cursor, clicking, typing) to accomplish that specific task.”
Software development platform Replit has used an early version of the new 3.5 Sonnet model to create an “autonomous verifier” that can evaluate apps while they’re being built. Canva, meanwhile, says that it’s exploring ways in which the new model might be able to support the designing and editing process.
But how is this any different than the other AI agents out there? It’s a reasonable question. Consumer gadget startup Rabbit is building a web agent that can do things like buying movie tickets online; Adept, which was recently acqui-hired by Amazon, trains models to browse websites and navigate software; and Twin Labs is using off-the-shelf models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4o, to automate desktop processes.
Anthropic claims the new 3.5 Sonnet is simply a stronger, more robust model that can do better on coding tasks than even OpenAI’s flagship o1, per the SWE-bench Verified benchmark. Despite not being explicitly trained to do so, the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet self-corrects and retries tasks when it encounters obstacles, and can work toward objectives that require dozens or hundreds of steps.
But don’t fire your secretary just yet.
In an evaluation designed to test an AI agent’s ability to help with airline booking tasks, like modifying a flight reservation, the new 3.5 Sonnet managed to complete less than half of the tasks successfully. In a separate test involving tasks like initiating a return, 3.5 Sonnet failed roughly a third of the time.
Anthropic admits the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet struggles with basic actions like scrolling and zooming, and that it can miss “short-lived” actions and notifications because of the way it takes screenshots and pieces them together.
“Claude’s Computer Use remains slow and often error-prone,” Anthropic writes in its post. “We encourage developers to begin exploration with low-risk tasks.”
But is the new 3.5 Sonnet capable enough to be dangerous? Possibly.
A recent study found that models without the ability to use desktop apps, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o, were willing to engage in harmful “multi-step agent behavior,” such as ordering a fake passport from someone on the dark web, when “attacked” using jailbreaking techniques. Jailbreaks led to high rates of success in performing harmful tasks even for models protected by filters and safeguards, according to the researchers.
One can imagine how a model with desktop access could wreak more havoc — say, by exploiting app vulnerabilities to compromise personal info (or storing chats in plaintext). Aside from the software levers at its disposal, the model’s online and app connections could open avenues for malicious jailbreakers.
Anthropic doesn’t deny that there’s risk in releasing the new 3.5 Sonnet. But the company argues that the benefits of observing how the model is used in the wild ultimately outweigh this risk.
“We think it’s far better to give access to computers to today’s more limited, relatively safer models,” the company wrote. “This means we can begin to observe and learn from any potential issues that arise at this lower level, building up computer use and safety mitigations gradually and simultaneously.”
Anthropic also says it has taken steps to deter misuse, like not training the new 3.5 Sonnet on users’ screenshots and prompts, and preventing the model from accessing the web during training. The company says it developed classifiers to “nudge” 3.5 Sonnet away from actions perceived as high-risk, such as posting on social media, creating accounts, and interacting with government websites.
As the U.S. general election nears, Anthropic says it is focused on mitigating election-related abuse of its models. The U.S. AI Safety Institute and U.K. Safety Institute, two separate but allied government agencies dedicated to evaluating AI model risk, tested the new 3.5 Sonnet prior to its deployment.
Anthropic told TechCrunch it has the ability to restrict access to additional websites and features “if necessary,” to protect against spam, fraud, and misinformation, for example. As a safety precaution, the company retains any screenshots captured by Computer Use for at least 30 days — a retention period that might alarm some devs.
We asked Anthropic under which circumstances, if any, it would hand over screenshots to a third party (e.g. law enforcement) if asked. A spokesperson said that the company would “comply with requests for data in response to valid legal process.”
“There are no foolproof methods, and we will continuously evaluate and iterate on our safety measures to balance Claude’s capabilities with responsible use,” Anthropic said. “Those using the computer-use version of Claude should take the relevant precautions to minimize these kinds of risks, including isolating Claude from particularly sensitive data on their computer.”
Hopefully, that’ll be enough to prevent the worst from occurring.
Today’s headliner might’ve been the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet model, but Anthropic also said an updated version of Haiku, the cheapest, most efficient model in its Claude series, is on the way.
Claude 3.5 Haiku, due in the coming weeks, will match the performance of Claude 3 Opus, once Anthropic’s state-of-the-art model, on certain benchmarks at the same cost and “approximate speed” of Claude 3 Haiku.
“With low latency, improved instruction following, and more accurate tool use, Claude 3.5 Haiku is well suited for user-facing products, specialized sub-agent tasks, and generating personalized experiences from huge volumes of data–like purchase history, pricing, or inventory data,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post.
3.5 Haiku will initially be available as a text-only model and later as part of a multimodal package that can analyze both text and images.
So once 3.5 Haiku is available, will there be much reason to use 3 Opus? What about 3.5 Opus, 3 Opus’ successor, which Anthropic teased back in June?
“All of the models in the Claude 3 model family have their individual uses for customers,” the Anthropic spokesperson said. “Claude 3.5 Opus is on our roadmap and we’ll be sure to share more as soon as we can.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/ex-spacex-engineers-land-14m-to-scale-new-method-for-3d-printing-metal/,Ex-SpaceX engineers land $14M to scale new method for 3D printing metal | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-22,"3D printing objects using metal is a well-established technique, but it tends to be too complex, expensive, or imprecise to match traditional methods at scale. Armed with $14 million from Nvidia and Boeing, Freeform aims to change that by building a new metal additive printing process that it says changes the game — and yes, there’s an AI angle, too.
Co-founders Erik Palitsch (CEO) and TJ Ronacher (president) both worked at SpaceX, where they were principal architect and lead analyst, respectively, of the Merlin engines and other programs. While there, they saw the potential of 3D printing parts using metal, but also experienced the method’s shortcomings firsthand.
“We saw the potential of metal printing; it has the potential to transform basically any industry that makes metal things. But adoption has been slow and success has been marginal at best,” said Palitsch. “Why is it not practical to use at scale? Fundamentally, because of three things: crappy and inconsistent quality; speed — commercial printers are very slow; and cost — the price for these printers is astronomical.”
They concluded that if they could operationalize the process to provide a printing service rather than sell a printer, they could crack the whole thing wide open. So they joined up with Tasso Lappas, former CTO of Velo3D, to start Freeform.
The primary mistake companies were making was using the likes of CNC machines, which are commonly used in traditional manufacturing, as a model for the metal-printing business. In that case, you sell the machine and its software, and make it work with whatever shapes and processes you use. But metal additive is different, Palitsch said.
“The way these things work today is they’re ‘open loop’ — they’re basically playing back a file,” he explained. “They needed to be smarter than that, because the process by which you melt metal powder with a laser is extremely complicated, and in a way infinitely variable.”
Selling people a machine and saying “become an expert to make it work, good luck,” isn’t a recipe for success.
“But when you decide you’re not going to build and package a printer into a box, when you have the freedom to build an automated factory from clean sheet, there’s a lot you can do,” Palitsch said.
Their solution is to provide printing as a service using a closed-loop process in a custom machine that monitors the print on a microsecond scale, adjusting various factors to achieve the kind of print that is expected at a workplace like SpaceX.
The company has plenty of tech advances to boast of, but the two most immediately relevant are the feedback loop and the AI that manages it.
“We have high-speed computer vision feedback on our system that runs at microsecond scale, and all that data is being processed on state of the art FPGAs and GPUs. We had to build this whole stack ourselves out of stuff that’s only become available in the last few years,” said Palitsch.
The closed-loop system with real-time monitoring mitigates the quality issues while still allowing speedy printing of complex geometries. And by operating as a printing service, they keep the business model simple.
But making that part of the system work required the second tech breakthrough: a machine-learning model fast enough and expert enough to actually perform that monitoring.
“Erik and TJ lived this and reached the same conclusions, that this industry required a level of compute and sensors that no one had ever deployed before,” said Lappas.
“To properly understand how to control the process, we needed datasets working at timescales that no one had. So we started building a state of the art telemetry system, a platform that would collect curated, controlled, almost self-labeled datasets.”
This data allowed them to bootstrap a model to generate more data for a better model, and so on.
But then they ran into the necessity of speed.
“There’s a lot we have in common with generative models, and a lot we don’t. But one thing that’s absolutely different is the latency,” Lappas explained. “Our inference needs to happen in microseconds so that we can close the loop on these processes.” With no off-the-shelf solution available for the data or the compute, they had to build the GPU/FPGA “AI on steroids” combo from scratch.
A consequential side effect: Freeform is “building the largest metal additive dataset in the world — that’s why companies like Boeing are coming to us,” said Palitsch. “We have this fundamental, core data collection and processing ability no one else has.”
Add that to the fundamental benefits of printing-based manufacturing, like the agility and versatility of factories, and it makes a pretty compelling business case.
Boeing’s AE Ventures and Nvidia invested a total of $14 million, though they declined to break that down further. Each company’s investment comes with perks: Nvidia gives them access to H100s and other compute hardware, while Boeing will shepherd them through the supplier qualification process and likely buy a bunch of parts. (Freeform will also join Nvidia’s Inception startup program.)
Palitsch said they have customers in the aerospace, automotive, industrial, and energy sectors, “the whole nine.” They declined to put any on the record, but did mention they’re making everything from rocket engine components to exhaust parts for Formula 1 cars. They plan to use the money to scale up, build out their next generation of (much faster) printers, and hire up to around 55 people total over the next year.
He admitted that their approach has taken time to grow from theory to reality, but that their methodical, technical approach is also what enabled their success.
“It was a slow transition,” Palitch said. “But I look back at it… with six people, we built, from scratch, the fastest laser melting platform on the planet, and the hardware and software for it. We did things people said you couldn’t do.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/stability-claims-its-newest-stable-diffusion-models-generate-more-diverse-images/,Stability claims its newest Stable Diffusion models generate more 'diverse' images | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-22,"Following a string of controversies stemming from technical hiccups and licensing changes, AI startup Stability AI has announced its latest family of image-generation models.
The new Stable Diffusion 3.5 series is more customizable and versatile than Stability’s previous-generation tech, the company claims — as well as more performant. There are three models in total:
While Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large and 3.5 Large Turbo are available today, 3.5 Medium won’t be released until October 29.
Stability says that the Stable Diffusion 3.5 models should generate more “diverse” outputs — that is to say, images depicting people with different skin tones and features — without the need for “extensive” prompting.
“During training, each image is captioned with multiple versions of prompts, with shorter prompts prioritized,” Hanno Basse, Stability’s chief technology officer, told TechCrunch in an interview. “This ensures a broader and more diverse distribution of image concepts for any given text description. Like most generative AI companies, we train on a wide variety of data, including filtered publicly available datasets and synthetic data.”
Some companies have cludgily built these sorts of “diversifying” features into image generators in the past, prompting outcries on social media. An older version of Google’s Gemini chatbot, for example, would show an anachronistic group of figures for historical prompts such as “a Roman legion” or “U.S. senators.” Google was forced to pause image generation of people for nearly six months while it developed a fix.
With any luck, Stability’s approach will be more thoughtful than others. We can’t give impressions, unfortunately, as Stability didn’t provide early access.
Stability’s previous flagship image generator, Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, was roundly criticized for its peculiar artifacts and poor adherence to prompts. The company warns that Stable Diffusion 3.5 models might suffer from similar prompting errors; it blames engineering and architectural trade-offs. But Stability also asserts the models are more robust than their predecessors in generating images across a range of different styles, including 3D art.
“Greater variation in outputs from the same prompt with different seeds may occur, which is intentional as it helps preserve a broader knowledge-base and diverse styles in the base models,” Stability wrote in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. “However, as a result, prompts lacking specificity might lead to increased uncertainty in the output, and the aesthetic level may vary.”
One thing that hasn’t changed with the new models is Stability’s licenses.
As with previous Stability models, models in the Stable Diffusion 3.5 series are free to use for “non-commercial” purposes, including research. Businesses with less than $1 million in annual revenue can also commercialize them at no cost. Organizations with more than $1 million in revenue, however, have to contract with Stability for an enterprise license.
Stability caused a stir this summer over its restrictive fine-tuning terms, which gave (or at least appeared to give) the company the right to extract fees for models trained on images from its image generators. In response to the blowback, the company adjusted its terms to allow for more liberal commercial use. Stability reaffirmed today that users own the media they generate with Stability models.
“We encourage creators to distribute and monetize their work across the entire pipeline,” Ana Guillén, VP of marketing and communications at Stability, said in an emailed statement, “as long as they provide a copy of our community license to the users of those creations and prominently display ‘Powered by Stability AI’ on related websites, user interfaces, blog posts, About pages, or product documentation.”
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large and Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo can be self-hosted or used via Stability’s API and third-party platforms including Hugging Face, Fireworks, Replicate, and ComfyUI. Stability says that it plans to release the ControlNets for the models, which allow for fine-tuning, in the next few days.
Stability’s models, like most AI models, are trained on public web data — some of which may be copyrighted or under a restrictive license. Stability and many other AI vendors argue that the fair-use doctrine shields them from copyright claims. But that hasn’t stopped data owners from filing a growing number of class action lawsuits.
Stability leaves it to customers to defend themselves against copyright claims, and, unlike some other vendors, has no payout carve-out in the event that it’s found liable.
Stability does allow data owners to request that their data be removed from its training datasets, however. As of March 2023, artists had removed 80 million images from Stable Diffusion’s training data, according to the company.
Asked about safety measures around misinformation in light of the upcoming U.S. general elections, Stability said that it “has taken — and continues to take — reasonable steps to prevent the misuse of Stable Diffusion by bad actors.” The startup declined to give specific technical details about those steps, however.
As of March, Stability only prohibited explicitly “misleading” content created using its generative AI tools — not content that could influence elections, hurt election integrity, or that features politicians and public figures.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/interface-ai-raises-30m-to-help-banks-field-customer-requests/,Interface.ai raises $30M to help banks field customer requests | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-22,"Interface.ai, a customer automation platform for banks and other financial institutions, today announced that it closed a $30 million funding round led by Avataar Venture Partners.
Twenty million dollars of the round was equity, while the remaining $10 million was in the form of debt. It’s Interface’s first outside capital; the startup had been completely bootstrapped.
“Interface is trusted by more than 100 financial institutions across North America, processing millions of interactions every day,” CEO and co-founder Srinivas Njay told TechCrunch. “We’re generating tens of millions in annual recurring revenue.”
Njay said that the inspiration for Interface came from his father, who owned a credit union in India. Previously, Njay worked at Microsoft as a product manager on the Bing advertising team and at EA as a senior product manager on mobile games.
Njay teamed up with Bruce Kim, the founder of customer management and billing company Inovaware, in 2019 to launch Interface.
“The big national banks are investing heavily in AI to transform their banking operations,” Njay said. “But for many regional and community-based financial institutions, staffing and resourcing this capability is simply out of reach. Interface democratizes access to AI.”
Interface’s core product is a collection of voice- and text-based AI agents designed to handle basic bank customer service requests. Powered by models trained on in-house data, the agents can perform tasks like helping modify mortgage payments and opening new accounts.
Banks can customize the agents by fine-tuning them on their internal data. The agents can also be configured to upsell products based on information like the content of prior chats.
“Our AI is specifically designed for the banking industry,” Njay said, “complete with pre-built integrations, data models, and workflows.”
Financial institutions are piloting AI — and in particular generative AI — for applications ranging from customer service to predictive analytics. According to a March survey cited in American Banker, more than half of global and U.S. banks intend to implement generative AI at some level over the next year.
Besides Interface, AI startups trying to nab a slice of banks’ business include Hyperplane, which builds AI models to predict customer behavior; Cambio, which creates AI to talk to a bank’s customers; and Digital Onboarding, which specializes in strengthening banks’ relationships with customers.
Banking customers are wary of the tech, however. In a J.D. Power poll, only 27% said that they’d trust AI for financial information and advice, while less than half said they’d take product recommendations from AI.
Institutions also aren’t necessarily deploying AI for customer communications — which is a big portion of Interface’s business. But in a spot of bright news, credit unions — one of Interface’s largest customer segments — have been aggressively adopting chatbot tech this year.
“Our platform has multiple levers for creating value,” Njay said. “The number of unique applications of AI is one of the main factors contributing to Interface’s ability to weather potential headwinds.”
With the new money from the funding round, Interface plans to expand its 120-person team across North America and India and “accelerate go-to-market initiatives.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/spotify-now-lets-you-create-custom-cover-art-for-your-playlists/,Spotify now lets you create custom cover art for your playlists | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-22,"Spotify is rolling out the ability for users to design and customize their own playlist cover art, the company announced on Tuesday. While users have already been able to upload a custom image for a playlist, this new feature lets you design you own cover art right in the app.
The feature is rolling out in 65 markets in beta on the Spotify mobile app on iOS and Android. It’s available to both free and premium users.
To access the feature, select one of your playlists you want to create custom art for. Then, tap the three-dot menu on the playlist page and click the “Create cover art” option.
From there, you can upload a photo from your camera roll or start with a blank canvas, and then play around with several different elements, such as text styles, colors, and effects. You can also change background colors and add gradients. Plus, you can add stickers.
Spotify notes that you can only save one custom cover art per playlist at a time, which means that when you create a new one, it will automatically replace the previous one for that specific playlist. If you want to make more than one cover art for a playlist, you need to save it before making another one.
While the ability to create custom cover art isn’t a significant addition to the streaming service, it’s a fun one. It also showcases Spotify’s continuous efforts to give users more ways to personalize their experience on the app. For instance, the company is currently beta testing a feature that lets users create personalized playlists based on written prompts.
The launch of the new feature comes as Spotify has been rolling out additions to its app as it continues to compete with services like Apple Music and YouTube Music.
Last week, Spotify announced it’s testing music videos for premium users in 85 additional markets. The feature will allow Spotify to better compete with YouTube, given the Google-owned platform’s native support for music videos."

CFO.com has pulled out the best quotes so you don’t have to watch the full interview.
“Maybe all of these companies are in a race to the bottom,” Andreessen said when talking about large language model (LLM) development.
While that might be stating the obvious, many aspiring entrepreneurs and veteran investors pay attention when Andreessen talks. As a reminder, his firm is also an investor in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. The VC participated in the $300 million round that valued OpenAI at between $27 billion and $29 billion in early 2023.
Things have drastically changed since then. Andreessen compared current AI development with “selling rice,” meaning that there isn’t much product differentiation. “It turns out anybody can make an LLM,” he said, invoking commodification."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/as-ozlos-sleepbuds-go-on-sale-company-raises-funds-for-tinnitus-treatment/,"As Ozlo's Sleepbuds go on sale, company raises funds for tinnitus treatment | TechCrunch",Brian Heater,2024-10-22,"Bose gave up on Sleepbuds after two generations. It was a sad, premature end for a promising product. The headphone maker came closer to creating a truly great pair of sleep headphones than anyone else. Ultimately, however, it seems the company was no longer interested in pursuing the product, which proved a major setback for the category at large.
The two generations of Sleepbuds we got weren’t without their faults, however. At the top of the list was a case of a company that was sure it knew what consumers wanted better than consumers themselves. The buds’ inability to stream Bluetooth audio was something Bose could have easily reconciled with the Sleepbuds 2.
Instead, the company was sure users would be content streaming preloaded white noise tracks. Any decision to limit choice in a consumer product must be justified by the manufacturer, but Bose never gave a compelling reason for limiting such choice. No doubt hardware limitations played a role, but streaming is an essential feature for a pair of $250 specialty earbuds.
In August 2023, a new contender emerged. Unlike other startups in the space, however, Ozlo wasn’t starting from scratch. The company was founded by former Bose executives, using IP licensed from the headphone maker.
For all intents and purposes aside from branding, these are the Sleepbuds 3. The form factor is the same. They’re housed in a puck-shaped charging case. The buds themselves are compliant and soft, with small wing tips that insure they won’t fall out if you’re tossing and/or turning. Most importantly, however, they’re small and sit flush with the wearer’s ear, assuring there’s no pressure or discomfort for side sleepers.
When I took my first meeting to discuss a mystery product with a number of former Bose sleep employees last year, the first question out of my mouth was whether the new product would support streaming. The answer was an enthusiastic “yes.” The team went on to describe some of the technical hurdles that needed clearing in order to deliver that promise in the same form factor as Bose’s buds, but that was enough to get me excited.
Since then, there’s been a whole lot of waiting. I found myself emailing the team every few months to get a status update like a spurned Indiegogo backer. Patience is a virtue in this world of hardware startups, but I had the impression that Ozlo was closer to launch than most, given the running start afforded the company by licensing Bose’s IP.
Complicating the matter is the fact that some early backers had already begun to receive units. I can, however, wholly understand why a hardware startup might be more reticent to send a first-gen device to hardware reviewers versus crowdfunders.
After some setbacks, Ozlo on Tuesday announced that its Sleepbuds are now available for purchase. At $299, they’re priced $50 more than the previous Bose device. Such differences aren’t unexpected, of course. For one thing, electronics are more expensive to produce at smaller scales. For another, there’s R&D and a boatload of other expenses that go into building such a product — even one that, again, was atop a solid enough foundation. One must also factor in the fact that, broadly speaking, the cost to manufacture has increased during these post-COVID times.
As for whether the price will come down in future iterations, it’s a possibility, though I wouldn’t hold my breath. The truth is that no one gets to be a pure hardware manufacturer these days. You need another leg for that stool. For some it’s software, for others AI. For Ozlo, it appears to be health. That’s not a surprise, given how essential it’s become to the entire wearables category.
In conjunction with product availability, Ozlo is announcing a new $12 million funding round led by LifeArc Ventures and featuring Drive by DraftKings, Wise Ventures, Scrum Ventures, Wheelhouse 360, Modi Ventures, Niremia Collective, and 5Point Venture Partners. The funding joins the around $8 million the company raised via crowdfunding.
Ozlo says the money will naturally go toward developing the second-generation Sleepbuds. More noteworthy, however, is the portion going to “FDA-clearance for Ozlo’s tinnitus therapy.” That second bit lays plain why many — myself included — are interested in Sleepbuds. But the obvious use cases of snoring partners and noisy cityscapes aside, such technology is no doubt intriguing to the 10% of the population living with ear ringing.
Ozlo has written a bit about the condition in the past, but it has thus far labeled such text with a disclaimer that its products are not FDA approved for treating tinnitus. Getting that regulatory stamp of approval would no doubt give the young startup a significant push.
I’ve been enjoying my time with the buds so far. I’ve run into the occasional fussy wireless connection, but have found that the length and quality of my sleep genuinely improves when I’m listening to ambient music via streaming. The ability to use preloaded sounds is nice — it’s a good fit for, say, a long flight — but you can access similar soundscapes through your streaming service of choice.
They’ve earned a permanent place in my travel bag."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/ipad-mini-2024-keeping-up-with-the-pack/,iPad Mini 2024: Keeping up with the pack | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-22,"It was a lean few years for the iPad. The tablet fell out of favor with Apple, as the company turned its focus to other categories like mobile, content, wearables, and mixed reality. The same could have been said about the Mac a few years prior, but the laptop/desktop group has had a renaissance in Cupertino, thanks largely to the arrival of Apple Silicon.
One could argue that the iPad is experiencing its own moment. Apple certainly made a statement in May, when the M4 debuted on the new iPad Pros. It was the first time the M-series of desktop processors premiered on a non-Mac device.
At different times in its history, the iPad has hewed more closely to either the iPhone or Mac. The May news made it clear that at the very least, Apple views the high end of its tablet line landing closer to the laptop side of things. At the same event, Apple brought M2 to the iPad Air. It was a 2-year-old chip, sure, but it still offered a lot of firepower for a little tablet.
Last week, the company updated the iPad Mini for the first time since 2021. Unlike the Pro and Air before it, the smallest member of the iPad family did not receive an M-series chip. Instead, Apple opted to outfit the 8.3-inch tablet with an A17 Pro — the same bit of silicon powering the new iPhone 16 Pro models.
With that move, the Mini leapfrogs the base iPad in compute power — though that is a result of the slate not receiving an update since the 10th gen arrived in 2022. Because of that discrepancy, the standard iPad is now several generations behind the Mini, with an A14 Bionic under the hood.
As a result, the Mini also leapfrogged the iPad in cost. The Wi-Fi version of the tablets now run $499 and $349, respectively, with the cellular/5G models coming in at $649 and $499. A $150 gulf is not insignificant, especially given the notable differences in screen sizes: 8.3 versus 10.1 inches.
In spite of its smaller size, however, the Mini is a more premium device than the 10th-gen iPad. For one thing, the Mini manages to pack in nearly as many pixels with a 2,266 x 1,488 resolution to the iPad’s 2,360 x 1,640. This, in turn, comes courtesy of a substantially higher pixel density at 326 ppi to the iPad’s 264.
As a matter of fact, the new Mini has a higher pixel density than any other iPad. Higher pixel densities matter more the smaller the screen, as they’re able to fit more, sharper details into a smaller space. It’s no wonder, then, that even the iPad Mini scores well below the iPhone 16’s 460 ppi.
Apple’s irregular iPad release schedule has left the line in flux. As it stands now, however, the Mini outdoes the base iPad by pretty much every metric, other than screen size. That is not an irrelevant detail, of course. In fact, the iPad Mini’s 8.3-inch screen size is almost exactly the halfway point between the iPad (10.1) and iPhone 16 Pro Max (6.3).
The Mini also occupies that liminal space as a tool. It is, for example, better for watching TV shows and movies than the iPhone, given its relatively large screen. But if entertainment is your primary driver, it’s difficult to make a case for the Mini over the Air, Pro, or even the base iPad.
To its credit, Apple is leaning into some key customer use cases with the welcome addition of Apple Pencil and Pencil Pro compatibility. At 7.69 x 5.3 inches, the tablet is a great size for taking notes and drawing. That’s certainly enhanced with the fully revamped version of Calculator, which is now a far more powerful math class companion.
Indeed, the tablet is well suited for the educational market in general. Its small size makes it a heck of a lot easier to toss into a backpack and pull out during a lecture. It’s also an ideal size for reading — though if that’s your primary application for a device like this, it may ultimately make more sense to invest in a devoted e-reader, like one of the new Kindles, as those devices are gentler on the eyes and offer significantly longer battery life than tablets.
The inclusion of the A17 Pro chip makes the Mini an interesting proposition in education for one more key reason: Apple Intelligence. As of this writing, current iPads — aside from the base model — will be able to run Apple’s small model generative AI platform. With that comes the ability to let iPadOS rewrite letters and other documents for you.
Having that sort of functionality baked into the operating system will only further serve to blur the lines when it comes to writing term papers. That said, there’s nothing in terms of text generation that Apple Intelligence can accomplish for which students don’t already have access to through platforms like ChatGPT.
As for the non-students of the world, the role of an iPad Mini is less apparent. I’ve certainly found applications for the form factor that slot well into my own life. For example, I plan to keep my notes for my Disrupt panels on the little tablet at next week’s event. Personally speaking, however, I don’t feel there are enough use cases in my own life to warrant the purchase of a small tablet rather than a big iPhone or standard iPad.
If you do, the upgraded silicon, Apple Intelligence compatibility, and Pencil use are all compelling reasons to upgrade."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/paccurate-is-helping-brands-ship-with-less-packaging/,"Paccurate helps companies ship in smaller boxes, saving them money while helping the earth | TechCrunch",Rebecca Szkutak,2024-10-22,"Paccurate co-founder and CEO James Malley likes to joke that once you get into supply chain tech, the category doesn’t let you back out.
Ten years ago, Malley and Patrick Powers were working together as consultants when they started getting asked the same question over and over. Their clients were asking for help reducing the empty space in their packaging boxes to avoid newly implemented fees from shippers like FedEx and UPS. Malley and Powers couldn’t find good software that solved that issue and started looking into solving the problem themselves.
“We had a fascination with the butterfly effect of this problem area,” Malley told TechCrunch. “The more tweaks you make to packaging, the bigger the downstream. If you use a 10% smaller box, on average it results in 10% fewer pallets and 10% fewer truck trips. It’s also one of the few areas in supply chain where sustainability and cost savings are the same exact thing.”
After a few years of research and development, they formally launched Paccurate in 2018. The software helps parcel shippers determine the most cost-effective and sustainable way to ship the items they need to, a process known as cartonization, by taking factors such as size, weight, and packaging requirements into account. Brands can also use Paccurate’s API to build systems themselves.
Cartonization is often embedded into other supply chain software, Malley said, but a lot of companies don’t trust it. He said that some services just aren’t accurate, while others are focused on helping companies get as much product into as few boxes as possible, which isn’t actually always the most sustainable or cost-efficient option.
When Malley and Powers launched the business, they thought of it as “building a better mouse trap” tech, not necessarily a venture-scalable company. Malley said the company was content to just bootstrap Paccurate and license the tech to other software companies until the pandemic changed the company’s plans.
But Paccurate got flooded with new and larger customers during the COVID e-commerce boom, so the startup started taking venture funding, taking a seed round in 2022 to keep up with demand. Growth has only accelerated since. Last year the company was processing about a million shipments a month, now it’s around a million shipments a day, and Paccurate is working with brands like Daily Harvest and Our Place.
Paccurate recently raised an $8.1 million Series A round led by Indianapolis-based VC High Alpha, with participation from Tech Square Ventures, Grand Ventures, and Springtime Ventures, among others.
This type of logistics is still largely dominated by legacy supply chain software players like the Numina Group and Packsize. While Paccurate isn’t the only startup building for this area — Belgian company Optioryx is another — it’s a significantly less saturated market than many other areas of supply chain, like last-mile freight.
Malley said they anticipate growth will continue for a few reasons. For one, Malley said that it’s one of the few areas where companies can actually cut costs when it comes to warehousing and shipping. He added that for years, companies seemed focused on bringing automation and robotics into the warehouse to cut costs, now many have turned to this area, he said.
Second, regulations will soon force companies to think more about how they are packaging. The European Union recently implemented regulations requiring shipping boxes to be at least 50% full. In the U.S., New Jersey introduced a bill earlier this year that would also require boxes to be at least half full; the bill has passed through the state senate.
“Well-packed boxes are generally not as full as you think they are, 50% empty could be a box that is well-packed and the penalties for not packaging correctly are staggering,” Malley said. “This is a canary in the coal mine. I’ll be watching closely to see which state will be next “"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/whatsapp-introduces-contact-saving-directly-within-the-app-teases-usernames/,"WhatsApp introduces contact storing directly within the app, teases usernames | TechCrunch",Ivan Mehta,2024-10-22,"WhatsApp on Tuesday announced a new feature that will allow users to save contacts within the app. That means that even if you lose your phone or link a new device to your primary number, you will see all your contacts stored within WhatsApp’s cloud storage.
Until now, WhatsApp relied on your phone’s contact book to sync contacts. If a new person messaged you on the app, and you wanted to save their details, the information would be stored locally on your device.
The new feature, rolling out soon, lets you store contacts on any device, including WhatsApp for the web and Windows. You can choose to sync contacts saved within WhatsApp to your phone, as well.
Last year, the company began allowing users to log into two WhatsApp accounts on one device. Saving contacts linked to one WhatsApp account is handy if you want to keep personal and business contacts separate. Plus, if you share the device with others, you can maintain your own contact list linked to your number.
WhatsApp said it developed a new encrypted storage system called Identity Proof Linked Storage (IPLS) to enable secure contact saving. When users save a contact, the system generates an encryption key on the device. The retrieval is based on the client authenticating its primary device identity.
Additionally, the app is partnering with Cloudflare to sign any changes to the cryptographic properties of a user’s directory. According to Meta, this step ensures that someone has not edited contacts saved in WhatsApp.
The company said that the tech behind the contact storing feature would make it possible to save contacts by usernames.
“Usernames on WhatsApp will add an extra degree of privacy so that you don’t need to share your phone number when messaging someone,” the company noted in a blog post.
The feature has been in development for some time. In May 2023, a report by WABetaInfo highlighted that WhatsApp has been working on introducing usernames to the app. WhatsApp rivals Signal and Telegram both offer a way for users to share their username with someone without sharing their contact details."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/turnover-labs-is-helping-chemical-plants-to-reuse-their-waste-co2/,Turnover Labs is helping chemical plants to reuse their waste CO2 | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-10-22,"As petrochemical plants and other emitters look to reduce emissions, they’re finding that sopping up and storing all the carbon dioxide they produce doesn’t come cheap. First they have to capture it, an energy-intensive process that requires specialized equipment. Then they have to transport it and stash it away, which can be tricky depending on where the plant is located.
“When it comes to a petrochemical plant, a lot of them want to do carbon capture and sequestration,” said Marissa Beatty, founder and CEO of Turnover Labs. “They haven’t figured out how they’re going to move massive quantities of this stuff off site and store it underground.”
Beatty is proposing an alternative: reuse the waste carbon dioxide on site by turning it into a building block used to make myriad chemical compounds. “We want to make as much use of that as possible,” she told TechCrunch.
Turnover Labs was born out of Beatty’s doctoral research into improving the durability of electrolyzers, which use electricity to facilitate a range of chemical reactions. As she was finishing her PhD, she started looking for opportunities to take the work with her to her next endeavor.
“It was something that I wasn’t really ready to abandon. I took it around to a bunch of different places to see if other electrolyzer startups might want it,” she said. They didn’t. “A bunch of my friends were doing startups as well, and I was like, should we do this?”
She poked at the idea more during a fellowship with Activate, a nonprofit that supports early-stage deep tech companies. “I spent a year just interviewing people all over. I had a million different ideas for how to take my technology, bring it to market,” Beatty said. “I really wanted to go the industrial route for it. And I just arrived over and over again at CO2.”
Electrolyzers have the potential to transform carbon dioxide into a range of different chemicals, but it’s often the other gases that come along with it that foul things up. Filtering them out to get pure CO2 is expensive. Beatty, though, figured her technology could improve the way electrolyzers behave in the presence of compounds that would normally degrade the catalysts that help the reactions along, causing them to break off and float away.
If catalysts were cheap, it wouldn’t be a big deal — you could just replace them. But they’re often expensive metals like platinum or silver. Turnover Labs ensures that the catalysts are more tightly adhered to an electrode, where chemical reactions take place in an electrolyzer. That, plus some other specialized chemistry and software, allows the company to transform carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide, which is used as an ingredient in a range of petrochemical reactions, while ignoring other gases in the waste stream.
The startup recently raised a $1.4 million pre-seed round led by GC Ventures and Pace Ventures, with participation from Collaborative Fund, Gigascale Capital, Impact Science Ventures, and Sandy Spring Climate Partners. Beatty said the funding will help hire a few more people as the company simulates and tests what will happen when its electrolyzer technology encounters the sorts of gas streams coming out of real-world petrochemical plants.
“We’re working with some partners right now to essentially just break our electrolyzer a bunch,” she said. “Seeing what breaks, seeing what doesn’t break, and then basically iterating until we have something really, really, really strong.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/socket-lands-a-fresh-40m-to-scan-software-for-security-flaws/,Socket lands a fresh $40M to scan software for security flaws | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-22,"The software supply chain, which comprises the components and processes used to develop software, has become precarious. According to one recent survey, 88% of companies believe poor software supply chain security presents an “enterprise-wide risk” to their organizations.
Open source supply chain components are especially fraught, thanks to the logistical hurdles in keeping each component well-maintained. Security firm Synopsys found in its 2023 report that 89% of businesses’ codebases contained open source tools over four years out of date. A 2024 report by the Ponemon Institute found that over half of organizations have experienced a software supply chain attack. These attacks could cost the economy almost $81 billion in lost revenue and damages by 2026, estimates Juniper Research.
Socket, a startup that provides tools to detect security vulnerabilities in open source code, has raised $40 million to help address the problem.
CEO Feross Aboukhadijeh founded Socket in 2020. A prolific open source maintainer and web security lecturer at Stanford, Aboukhadijeh says he came to believe that traditional security tools were insufficient to address the challenges of modern software development.
“The extensive network of dependencies — numbering in the thousands — pose significant security risks that traditional tools fail to mitigate,” Aboukhadijeh told TechCrunch. Dependencies are pieces of software or libraries that an app relies on to function. “Even with rigorous internal code reviews, external dependencies introduce the risk of software supply chain attacks that are hard to detect and manage,” Aboukhadijeh continued.
Socket’s solution is a scanner that looks for malicious activity, like backdoors and obfuscated code, in open source components, and alerts developers when dependencies and packages are updated or added.
Through integrations with generative AI APIs from Anthropic and OpenAI, Socket can also generate summaries of vulnerabilities (with minimal hallucinations, one hopes). In addition, the platform can optionally check to see that open source code is properly licensed — and therefore legal — for re-use.
“Socket is designed for engineering teams and application security teams who rely heavily on open source software,” Aboukhadijeh said. “It integrates seamlessly into the developer workflow, providing real-time insights during code reviews and dependency updates without overwhelming users with false positives.”
More software companies are relying on open source than ever before. In a 2023 report published in collaboration with the Open Source Initiative and the Eclipse Foundation, 95% of respondents said that their organizations increased — or at least maintained — their open source usage in the past year.
With the software supply chain security platform market expected to grow to as much as $3.5 billion by 2027, it’s not surprising that Socket has rivals.
Oligo, a company that focuses on runtime app security and observability, came out of stealth in February backed by $28 million. Endor emerged from stealth with $25 million last October, following Chainguard’s $50 million raise in early June.
What sets Socket apart, Aboukhadijeh argues, is its ability to catch possibly harmful code other tools miss — in particular code to exfiltrate sensitive data. Socket is detecting over 100 zero-day software supply chain attacks every week, he claims.
Socket’s impressive list of backers — and clients — would suggest that there’s some credence to those assertions.
Entrepreneur Elad Gil and Andreessen Horowitz participated in Socket’s Series B, along with Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang (disclosure: Yahoo is TechCrunch’s corporate parent), OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor, Twilio co-founder Jeff Lawson, and Shopify co-founder and CEO Tobias Lütke.
Socket’s customers, meanwhile, include Anthropic, Harvey, Figma, Vercel, one of the four biggest banks in the U.S., and “the largest and most well-recognized AI company.” (Interpret the last one as you will.)
Aboukhadijeh described the new Series B round as “pre-emptive,” claiming that Socket still hasn’t spent the Series A cash that it raised last August.
“We are on track to grow revenue by 400% in 2024,” Aboukhadijeh told TechCrunch. “Socket currently has over 100 customers and protects more than 7,500 organizations, defending 300,000 code repositories and supporting over 1 million developers worldwide.”
The new cash brings Socket’s total raised to $65 million during what Aboukhadijeh described as a pivotal moment in open source history. AI, he pointed out, is being used to write more and more code, which is introducing the potential for security holes.
“Now was the right time to raise these funds,” Aboukhadijeh said. “New AI attack vectors have created a pressing need for Socket to bring security assurances to the code generated by these AI-powered tools. Socket’s technology addresses this critical gap in the market, and the additional funding will help scale its impact.”
Socket, which has 32 employees, plans to grow its team to 50 people by the end of the year with a focus on the engineering, product, design, and sales sides of the Stanford-based company.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/desktop-ai-assistant-app-highlight-spins-out-of-medal-with-10m-in-funding/,Desktop AI assistant app Highlight spins out of Medal with $10M in funding | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-22,"Earlier this year, Medal, a startup known for its video game clipping features, launched a cross-platform AI assistant called Highlight. Now the company is spinning off Highlight into a new entity, which has raised $10 million in a funding round.
General Catalyst led the funding round with Valor, SV Angel, and Conviction Embed participating in the round. Medal also put in $3 million in the new entity out of $13 million it raised in July.
Medal’s co-founder, Pim de Witte, is the only common link between Medal and Highlight now, as the latter has its own team, including Haris Butt, who was VP of Design at productivity company ClickUp, Medal co-founder Josh Lipson, and Medal’s first head of growth Mark Bond.
“We started Highlight as a research project within Medal. We wanted to explore the translation layer between LLMs (large language models) and what’s going on your screen. But we realized to grow quickly and hire engineers for a specific app by offering them equity, Highlight needs to be a separate entity,” de Witte told TechCrunch over a call.
Highlight is a cross-platform desktop app that lets you attach your screen, a voice note, or a document as context and then ask questions to an LLM. The app can also transcribe your calls from system audio, so you can ask questions about a particular meeting later.
You can perform actions that have become pretty common with AI assistants, such as summarizing, rewriting, highlighting, and explaining the context attached to the app at the time of querying.
In July, the company had opened its platform for developers to build apps on top of Highlight. However, the startup realized that this approach would limit custom actions to a handful of developers. With the latest version, the company will allow users to prompt their way to a custom action like summarizing the first 10 minutes of a meeting. Highlight also wants to open up prompts to the community of users, helping one person discover a useful automation someone has created.
For developers with programming knowledge, the company plans to open an agentic framework that will allow them to use parts of your system and do small tasks — such as summarizing documents in a particular folder — in the background.
“Our idea is to create virtual employees so you can start delegating some of your tasks to them and have more time on your hands,” de Witte said.
With today’s announcement, the company is releasing a push-to-talk shortcut and new conversations app that records your meetings.
Niko Bonatsos, managing director at General Catalyst, told TechCrunch over email that Highlight is easy to understand for users because of the on-screen context and the lack of complex prompts.
“I’ve been underwhelmed by the fact that most consumer-facing AI companies only let you interact with them via chat interfaces … This demonstrates a lack of imagination and frankly limits what is possible with this powerful new technology. We are very encouraged with the bold design choices that Pim and his team have made so far,” Bonatsos said, pointing out that Highlight’s combination of automation and on-screen context allows users to utilize AI better.
Highlight AI is free to use for now, but the company wants to adopt a pricing plan based on the word count processed by the assistant down the line."

That’s not surprising given that the main story is an in-depth interview with Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple and the king of minimalistic design.
In Cook’s interview with the WSJ’s Ben Cohen, we learn he still believes the Vision Pro is going to be a success. He also sticks to his line that Apple isn’t lagging behind on artificial intelligence. (As Apple employees like to say, the company is usually “not first, but best.”)
But perhaps the most surprising detail in the feature is that Cook didn’t know you can choose your own name for (iMessage) group chats.
“Do you name yours? Interesting. I may take that on,” Cook told Cohen.
Just as most Apple products are now waterproof, Apple’s CEO seems impermeable to humor: Cook decided to name a group chat with his former college roommates as — simply — “Roommates.”"

And incumbents now want to get in on the action.
On Tuesday, video-conferencing company Zoom said it is partnering with Suki, one such AI medical scribe provider, to offer doctors on its platform an AI scribe that can take notes about their consultations with patients. Zoom is used for about 36% of all telehealth visits in the U.S., making it the most popular video-conferencing platform, according to industry intelligence group Definitive Healthcare.
Punit Soni, founder and CEO of Suki, told TechCrunch that Zoom had considered every other AI medical scribe startup before choosing Suki. The startup closed a $70 million Series D earlier this month.
Zoom’s founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, told Fortune earlier this month that the company is aiming to morph from a conferencing company to one focused on AI tools for workplaces.
Amazon-owned One Medical has also said it is integrating AI tools to help clinicians on its platform save time on administrative tasks. Instead of partnering with a startup in the space, One Medical is leveraging Amazon’s Bedrock, a service that helps build AI applications, and AWS HealthScribe, Amazon’s home-grown note-taking platform for clinicians.
Large healthcare systems and smaller doctors’ offices have found that AI software can save them hours spent on keeping up with necessary documentation. Most companies in the space have also seen their revenue tick up fast, investors say.
Other startups that use AI for medical note-taking include Abridge (reportedly raising $250 million at a $2.5 billion valuation), Nabla, and Ambiance Healthcare. Microsoft’s Nuance is also an important player in this market.
Although the market is crowded, and there is a risk that general-purpose foundational models may eventually be able to replace AI medical scribe startups, investors say that there’s sufficient differentiation between these companies for now. For example, Abridge serves large medical systems, while others are geared toward smaller medical offices."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/crewai-uses-third-party-models-to-automate-business-tasks/,CrewAI uses third-party models to automate business tasks | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-22,"Back in 2022, João Moura was directing AI engineering efforts at Clearbit, a startup creating a unified hub for business intelligence tools. There, Moura was responsible for leading the development of AI integrations, as well as defining Clearbit’s AI product roadmap.
After a year, HubSpot acquired Clearbit, and Moura had the itch to go it alone. He’d founded startups before, including Urdog, which sold a smart collar for pets. But this go-round, Moura had a more technically ambitious concept in mind.
Moura’s newest company, CrewAI, aims to automate repetitive, back-office tasks like summarizing reports and onboarding employees. Customers can build workflow automations using CrewAI’s platform, then deploy and track them from a dashboard.
CrewAI doesn’t train AI models itself. Rather, the company taps models from vendors such as OpenAI and Anthropic to drive automations. Companies can build workflows on top of the apps they already use to automate things like enriching marketing databases, analyzing customer feedback, and forecasting trends.
Moura pitches CrewAI as an alternative to robotic process automation, or RPA. RPA drives workflow automation. But it’s a much more rigid form based on “if-then” preset rules.
“We have made it easy for teams to build groups of AI ‘agents’ to perform tasks using any model, integrate with more than a thousand different applications, and to do so in a way that protects their data privacy,” Moura said. “We encourage our customers to try multiple models and pick the models that provide the best results for specific business use cases.”
RPA is indeed brittle — and error-prone. A 2022 survey from Robocorp, an RPA vendor, found that of the organizations that said they’d adopted RPA, 69% experienced broken workflows at least once weekly. Entire businesses have been made out of helping enterprises manage their RPA installations and prevent them from breaking.
Of course, AI can break, too — or rather, hallucinate and suffer from the effects of bias. Still, Moura argues that it’s a far more resilient tech than RPA.
Investors seem to agree. CrewAI has raised $18 million across seed and Series A rounds from backers, including Boldstart Ventures, Craft Ventures, Earl Grey Capital, and Insight Partners. Coursera co-founder and AI entrepreneur Andrew Ng has also invested, as has Dharmesh Shah, the co-founder and CTO of HubSpot.
CrewAI has competition in spades. Orby, Bardeen (which also has funding from HubSpot), Tektonic, 11x.ai, Twin Labs, and Emergence are all developing similar AI-powered, business-focused workflow automation products. Traditional RPA vendors like Automation Anywhere and UiPath, meanwhile, are working to incorporate more AI tech into their tools in an effort to stay relevant.
To its credit, CrewAI, which is currently valued at around $100 million, has managed to attract a sizable number of customers — 150 — in its first year. (CrewAI launched in January.) And it’s angling to land more with Enterprise Cloud, a new managed subscription plan.
Built on top of open source components CrewAI has released over the past year, Enterprise Cloud provides additional access controls and analytics to help secure and audit automations. Subscribers also get “VIP” support and templates for workflows.
“We are seeing 100,000 groups of multi-AI executions per day across hundreds of different use cases,” Moura said. “Given our current pipeline, we could be cash-flow-positive by next summer.”
CrewAI, which is based in San Francisco and Brazil, plans to use the cash it has raised so far to grow its 16-person workforce and expand its core automation products."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/zomato-to-raise-1b-ahead-of-rival-swiggy-india-ipo/,Zomato to raise $1 billion ahead of rival Swiggy India IPO | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-10-22,"Zomato on Tuesday said its board has approved a plan to raise $1 billion via a sale of shares to institutional investors, as competition in India’s quick-commerce sector heats up.
The timing of the share sale, the company’s first major fundraise since its 2021 IPO, is notable, because it comes just weeks before its rival Swiggy’s public debut. Bengaluru-based Swiggy, backed by Prosus Ventures, SoftBank, and Accel, aims to raise about $1.4 billion in its IPO next month.
The move by Zomato, which one investor characterized as “sucking the air out of the room” for competitors, has caught market observers off-guard. Jefferies analysts called the capital raise “unexpected,” given Zomato’s existing $1.2 billion cash reserves. They suggest the strategy may be aimed at reducing foreign institutional investor ownership in Zomato below 50%, effectively transforming it into a “domestic” company.
The shift to majority domestic ownership could enable Blinkit, Zomato’s quick-commerce subsidiary, to adopt an inventory-based model in India. Current regulations restrict foreign-owned companies to conduct only marketplace operations and prohibit them from owning inventory sold within the country.
“Industry interactions indicate vendors’ take-rate is approximately 2% of GOV to offset operational costs and generate returns on investments,” Jefferies analysts noted. “An inventory model would give Blinkit tighter control over stock and enable calculated risk-taking in launching and scaling new categories beyond grocery.”
In a letter sent to shareholders on Tuesday, Zomato co-founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal said the firm needed the additional capital because of “the competitive landscape and the much larger scale of our business today.”
“We believe that capital by itself does not give anyone the right to win (and that service quality is the key determinant of success), but we want to ensure that we are on a level playing field with our competitors, who continue to raise additional capital,” he wrote.
Zomato, which reported a profit of $20.9 million on revenue of $570 million (up 70% year-on-year) in the quarter ended September, faces intense competition from Swiggy, Zepto, and BigBasket. Through Blinkit, Zomato leads India’s quick-commerce market, which is expected to generate run-rate annual revenues of more than $6.5 billion.
The quick-commerce phenomenon (deliveries of groceries, office supplies, and an expanding range of items to customers within minutes) has transformed consumer behavior in India, disrupted traditional e-commerce business models, and exceeded market expectations.
Zepto, headquartered in Mumbai, is also in the market to raise funds. It’s in advanced talks to raise about $100 million from Indian family offices and high-net-worth individuals, TechCrunch reported last week."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/tim-cooks-other-job/,Tim Cook's other job | TechCrunch,Connie Loizos,2024-10-22,"In May, while unveiling the newest iPad at an Apple event, CEO Tim Cook wore a custom-made, one-of-a-kind pair of Nike sneakers whose decorative stitching included the words “Made on iPad.”
It wasn’t just a collab between Apple and Nike. As Bloomberg reminds readers, Cook has been on Nike’s board since 2005, when Cook was still second banana at Apple under Steve Jobs and the iPhone did not yet exist in the world.
It’s a bigger commitment than some might imagine. According to Bloomberg, Cook is not just Nike’s lead independent director and its compensation committee chair, but as part of a needed turnaround story right now at Nike, Cook helped secure former Nike exec Elliott Hill as the company’s newest CEO.
Hill, who began as an intern at Nike and retired in 2020, returned last week to replace former eBay CEO John Donahoe, who Cook had earlier endorsed for the top job. With Nike facing slowing growth in China amid other challenges, Donahoe lasted just four years in the role."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/passionfroot-is-building-a-platform-for-brand-and-creator-colloboration-with-a-focus-on-b2b-sector/,Passionfroot is a marketplace for business-focused content creators looking for brand partnerships — and vice versa | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-22,"As the creator economy is growing rapidly, brand partnerships remain one of the prime ways creators can earn money. Other services like link-in-bio apps with affiliate links or Patreon-like subscriptions become secondary ways to increase creators’ income. For platforms and startups, the biggest challenge remains to match brands and creators for collaboration.
Berlin-based startup Passionfroot is building a toolkit and a marketplace for business, productivity, and thought leadership-focused creators for brand collaborations.
The company was founded by CEO Jen Phan, who had a career in early-stage investing, and Lorenzo De Nobili, who previously started a marketplace connecting users with different professionals for services. The startup has raised $3.8 million in a seed funding round led by VC Supernode Global, with other investors, including Miro CEO Andrey Khusid’s s16vc, Sequoia, Accel’s Scout Fund, and Creandum, also participating (Creandum previously invested in the company’s $3.4 million pre-seed round too). The seed round included angels such as former Zapier CMO Kieran Flanagan, ex-community and creator lead at Notion Ben Lang, Linktree CPO Jiaona Zhang, and Austin Lau, who looks after growth at Anthropic.
Before launching Passionfroot, Phan launched a tech newsletter in 2020 for tech professionals with immigration backgrounds. She thought about leaving her VC role and going full-time on the newsletter.
“Amid this evolution, a new breed of business-focused creators emerged, producing thought leadership content across platforms like LinkedIn, newsletters, and podcasts. However, after speaking with dozens of creators, I realized that while the creative freedom is appealing, the business side — especially brand partnerships, which serve as a primary revenue stream — remains fragmented and inefficient,” Phan told TechCrunch.
She added that the decision to build Passionfroot also stemmed from brands struggling to find relevant creators, managing the schedule of campaigns, and co-ordinating payouts.
Zain Kahn, who is the founder of AI-focused newsletter Superhuman, said one of the biggest challenges for creators is chasing pending payments from brands and partners.
“In our early days, we had this one $40K payment that didn’t show up for months. We had to chase banks for ages to track and resolve the issue. We were paying salaries out of our personal savings and came very close to going out of business,” he told TechCrunch over an email.
Passionfroot lets creators build a storefront for ad or brand partnership slots they have on their different channels, including newsletters, YouTube, LinkedIn, and TikTok. Creators can build a media kit for brands highlighting their brand collaboration rates, engagement rates of their channels, and schedules. Creators can also show examples of past sponsorships on their Passionfroot page.
The toolkit also makes it easy for brands to book a campaign with creators through automated scheduling. Creators can share their pages with brands — just like a link-in-bio page. The startup counts HubSpot, Notion, and Freshbook as some of their brand partners.
On the other side of the marketplace, the startup has also built a network where brands can discover relevant creators on the platform. Phan said that deals booked through the network are currently equivalent to deals booked through specific creators’ storefronts.
Passionfroot has a 15% take rate for any brand partnership that materializes through its network, including payment fees. The company takes 5% in payment fees if a brand books a partnership with a creator through their storefront.
The company is launching its revamped website with better creator search and matching functionality for marketers. The platform also shows a match score to marketers, helping them select the best creator suited for a particular campaign. In the coming months, the startup will build a dashboard with campaign insights and better support for marketing teams — rather than an individual — to use Passionfroot.
Sabina Wizander from Creandum believes that Passionfroot has a unique advantage with its focus on the B2B segment.
“The company is starting with the B2B market both from creators and such companies. In this market, there is nothing called being 50% relevant. So the startup has the right product-market fit from the get-go,” she told TechCrunch over a call.
According to an eMarketer report, U.S. influencer marketing spending in 2024 is set to be around $7.14 billion, with a 15.8% year-on-year growth, signaling that marketers are looking to reach consumers through different channels.
Gina King, a partner at Supernode Global, said Passionfroot is building its product at a very opportune time.
“Passionfroot is well-timed to capitalize on multiple market shifts. The company is not just riding a single trend but is well-positioned to benefit from several concurrent developments in the creator economy, B2B marketing, and technology,” she said.
King also added that 87% of Passionfroot partners are organically proving that the company has a strong network effect.
Startups like VSCO for photographers, Agentio for YouTubers, and Catch + Release for licensable assets have tried to formalize transactions and partnerships between brands and creators. Large-scale social networks like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok have also experimented with building platforms around matching brands and creators."

Meta tells TechCrunch these accounts violated its privacy policy, citing a “risk of physical harm” against the individuals.
Links to Instagram/Threads accounts tracking the flights of former president Donald Trump, Florida governor Ron DeSantis, and other celebrity accounts, produced an error message on Monday night reading, “The link you followed may be broken, or the page may have been removed.” Sweeney’s account tracking Taylor Swift’s jet was disabled earlier this year.
“Given the risk of physical harm to individuals, and in keeping with the independent Oversight Board’s recommendation, we’ve disabled these accounts for violating our privacy policy,” said a Meta spokesperson in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.
Sweeney posted from his personal account, “Today feels like December 15th 2022,” referencing the time Elon Musk permanently suspended his @ElonJet account from Twitter.
In May, U.S. president Joe Biden signed a bill that allows private aircraft owners to anonymize their registration information. However, Sweeney has said tracking high-profile individuals is still easily doable, including through tips from other flight-tracking enthusiasts."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/indias-neysa-bags-30m-to-compete-with-global-ai-hyperscalers/,India's Neysa bags $30M to compete with global AI hyperscalers | TechCrunch,Jagmeet Singh,2024-10-22,"Even though India isn’t at the forefront of the global AI innovation battle, demand for AI in the country is growing as businesses seek efficiencies and tech companies promote AI developments as a cure-all. The South Asian nation is projected to have an AI market touching $17 billion by 2027, according to a joint report by the IT industry body Nasscom and consulting firm BCG.
Neysa, an Indian startup led by seasoned tech entrepreneur Sharad Sanghi, aims to leverage this growth opportunity by offering its AI solutions to local and multinational businesses in the country.
The Mumbai-based startup provides AI and machine learning infrastructure and platform as a service to enterprise customers based on their requirements. It also includes dedicated machine learning operations and infrastructure consulting teams to help customers find the relevant size for their infrastructure and to fine-tune or customize the models they choose.
Before founding Neysa with his former colleague Anindya Das in 2023, Sanghi spent over 27 years at his previous venture and data center provider, Netmagic, which Japan’s NTT Data acquired in 2016. He told TechCrunch that he intended to focus on cloud infrastructure and AI in 2022 but was unable to do so. He resigned as the managing director and CEO of Netmagic in June 2023 to start fresh with Neysa.
“I started at Neysa with a view of providing infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, inference as a service, the services layer around ML, as well as the platforms that we need for developers,” he said in an interview.
Neysa initially started as an infrastructure service provider and launched its flagship platform, Velocis, in July to provide on-demand access to computing infrastructure. However, it plans to expand the product lineup by launching its developer platform and inference as a service before year-end. The startup is also working on developing an “observability for better management” of its infrastructure and securing AI workloads, Sanghi said.
With its entire suite of offerings getting ready, Neysa is looking to compete with global hyperscalers, including the typical cloud service providers such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, as well as the new-age contenders like CoreWeave and Lambda Labs. Sanghi asserted that the startup differentiates from the existing players by offering “flexibility” in its models.
“We can offer both public cloud and private clusters. It’s also the open source nature of our offering. All our platforms are built on open source platforms … so there’s no lock-in for clients,” he stated.
The startup’s consultation service also aims to attract local businesses, which often find it challenging to get the appropriate infrastructure without spending thousands of dollars.
“Very often, clients come to us and say that they want so many GPUs … and when we really look at the requirement, they don’t need half the amount they had asked,” Sanghi said.
Neysa has raised $30 million in an all-equity Series A round co-led by its existing investors NTTVC, Z47 (formerly called Matrix Partners India), and Nexus Venture Partners. This follows up the startup’s $20 million seed round earlier this year.
The fresh funding, Sanghi said, will augment Neysa’s infrastructure, enhance its R&D, and broaden go-to-market. The funds will also set the base for the startup to launch its integrated generative AI acceleration cloud service.
The startup currently has a headcount of 55 people, which it will grow by adding more engineers and staff to expand direct and indirect sales.
Neysa currently has around 12 paying customers and runs about six large proof-of-concepts. As much as 70% of its entire customer base has opted for the private cluster, while the remaining 30% is on a public cloud, Sanghi said.
While Sanghi didn’t disclose the names of Neysa’s customers, he said the startup caters to broadly three categories: research institutes, AI-native startups, and enterprise customers, initially in the banking, manufacturing, and media sectors.
Neysa’s current customer base is in India, though Sanghi said the startup does plan to enter global markets with its next round of funding — talks for which have already started, and it is expected to close in the next six to nine months.
He did not reveal the exact amount Neysa seeks to raise in its next round, though he stated that it would be “in an order of magnitude more than what we’ve currently raised.” The startup also plans to raise debt to fulfill the growing GPU and other infrastructure requirements."

SpaceX filed a lawsuit against a California agency last week after the body rejected a proposal to increase the company’s launches from the state’s coastline to 50 per year.
The California Coastal Commission made its decision at an October 10 meeting, despite the U.S. Air Force endorsing the plan on the grounds that more launches of Starlink and Starshield, the defense-focused unit, are critical to national security.
In the lawsuit, SpaceX says that the commission engaged in “naked political discrimination” when some commissioners cited the political activity of CEO Elon Musk, while also attempting to unlawfully regulate federal agency activities. The first part of the complaint has gotten most of the headlines, and SpaceX will need to prove in court that the commission’s decision was substantially influenced by Musk’s politics. But the second part is arguably more substantial: What is the final legal authority over launch activities on a defense base, and do those activities count as federal or private when conducted by a commercial entity on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD)?
I had a lot of fun chatting with some of the co-founders of Wyvern, a Canadian hyperspectral imaging startup. The company just raised $6 million led by defense-focused VC firm Squadra Ventures to, among other things, expand into the U.S. market.
“As a Canadian company, we need to enter the U.S. market. We need to access key defense programs and bid on those sorts of programs of record,” co-founder Kurtis Broda said. (Co-founder Kristen Cote added, however, that “We are proud to be Canadian.”)
Billionaire Michael Bloomberg took aim at NASA’s Artemis program this week in an op-ed at Bloomberg, calling it “a colossal waste of taxpayer money.” Beyond the engorged budgets of the Space Launch System rocket and other parts of the Artemis architecture, he points to a feasible commercial alternative that’s staring everyone right in the face: SpaceX.
“A celestial irony is that none of this is necessary. A reusable SpaceX Starship will very likely be able to carry cargo and robots directly to the moon — no SLS, Orion, Gateway, Block 1B or ML-2 required — at a small fraction of the cost. Its successful landing of the Starship booster was a breakthrough that demonstrated how far beyond NASA it is moving.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/meta-tests-facial-recognition-for-spotting-celeb-bait-ads-scams-and-easier-account-recovery/,Meta tests facial recognition for spotting 'celeb-bait' ads scams and easier account recovery | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-21,"Meta is expanding tests of facial recognition as an anti-scam measure to combat celebrity scam ads and more broadly, the Facebook owner announced Monday.
Monika Bickert, Meta’s VP of content policy, wrote in a blog post that some of the tests aim to bolster its existing anti-scam measures, such as the automated scans (using machine learning classifiers) run as part of its ad review system, to make it harder for fraudsters to fly under its radar and dupe Facebook and Instagram users to click on bogus ads.
“Scammers often try to use images of public figures, such as content creators or celebrities, to bait people into engaging with ads that lead to scam websites where they are asked to share personal information or send money. This scheme, commonly called ‘celeb-bait,’ violates our policies and is bad for people that use our products,” she wrote.
“Of course, celebrities are featured in many legitimate ads. But because celeb-bait ads are often designed to look real, they’re not always easy to detect.”
The tests appear to be using facial recognition as a back-stop for checking ads flags as suspect by existing Meta systems when they contain the image of a public figure at risk of so-called “celeb-bait.”
“[W]e will try to use facial recognition technology to compare faces in the ad against the public figure’s Facebook and Instagram profile pictures,” Bickert wrote. “If we confirm a match and that the ad is a scam, we’ll block it.”
Meta claims the feature is not being used for any other purpose than for fighting scam ads. “We immediately delete any facial data generated from ads for this one-time comparison regardless of whether our system finds a match, and we don’t use it for any other purpose,” she said.
The company said early tests of the approach — with “a small group of celebrities and public figures” (it did not specify whom) — has shown “promising” results in improving the speed and efficacy of detecting and enforcing against this type of scam.
Meta also told TechCrunch it thinks the use of facial recognition would be effective for detecting deepfake scam ads, where generative AI has been used to produce imagery of famous people.
The social media giant has been accused for many years of failing to stop scammers misappropriating famous people’s faces in a bid to use its ad platform to shill scams like dubious crypto investments to unsuspecting users. So it’s interesting timing for Meta to be pushing facial recognition-based anti-fraud measures for this problem now, at a time when the company is simultaneously trying to grab as much user data as it can to train its commercial AI models (as part of the wider industry-wide scramble to build out generative AI tools).
In the coming weeks Meta said it will start displaying in-app notifications to a larger group of public figures who’ve been hit by celeb-bait — letting them know they’re being enrolled in the system.
“Public figures enrolled in this protection can opt-out in their Accounts Center anytime,” Bickert noted.
Meta is also testing use of facial recognition for spotting celebrity imposer accounts — for example, where scammers seek to impersonate public figures on the platform in order to expand their opportunities for fraud — again by using AI to compare profile pictures on a suspicious account against a public figure’s Facebook and Instagram profile pictures.
“We hope to test this and other new approaches soon,” Bickert added.
Additionally, Meta has announced that it’s trialing the use of facial recognition applied to video selfies to enable faster account unlocking for people who have been locked out of their Facebook/Instagram accounts after they’ve been taken over by scammers (such as if a person were tricked into handing over their passwords).
This looks intended to appeal to users by promoting the apparent utility of facial recognition tech for identity verification — with Meta implying it will be a quicker and easier way to regain account access than uploading an image of a government-issued ID (which is the usual route for unlocking access access now).
“Video selfie verification expands on the options for people to regain account access, only takes a minute to complete and is the easiest way for people to verify their identity,” Bickert said. “While we know hackers will keep trying to exploit account recovery tools, this verification method will ultimately be harder for hackers to abuse than traditional document-based identity verification.”
The facial recognition-based video selfie identification method Meta is testing will require the user to upload a video selfie that will then be processed using facial recognition technology to compare the video against profile pictures on the account they’re trying to access.
Meta claims the method is similar to identity verification used to unlock a phone or access other apps, such as Apple’s Face ID on the iPhone. “As soon as someone uploads a video selfie, it will be encrypted and stored securely,” Bickert added. “It will never be visible on their profile, to friends, or to other people on Facebook or Instagram. We immediately delete any facial data generated after this comparison regardless of whether there’s a match or not.”
Conditioning users to upload and store a video selfie for ID verification could be one way for Meta to expand its offerings in the digital identity space — if enough users opt in to uploading their biometrics.
All these tests of facial recognition are being run globally, per Meta. However the company noted, rather conspicuously, that tests are not currently occurring in the U.K. or the European Union — where comprehensive data protection regulations apply. (In the specific case of biometrics for ID verification, the bloc’s data protection framework demands explicit consent from the individuals concerned for such a use case.)
Given this, Meta’s tests appear to fit within a wider PR strategy it has mounted in Europe in recent months to try to pressure local lawmakers to dilute citizens’ privacy protections. This time, the cause it’s invoking to press for unfettered data-processing-for-AI is not a (self-serving) notion of data diversity or claims of lost economic growth but the more straightforward goal of combating scammers.
“We are engaging with the U.K. regulator, policymakers, and other experts while testing moves forward,” Meta spokesman Andrew Devoy told TechCrunch. “We’ll continue to seek feedback from experts and make adjustments as the features evolve.”
However, while use of facial recognition for a narrow security purpose might be acceptable to some — and, indeed, might be possible for Meta to undertake under existing data protection rules — using people’s data to train commercial AI models is a whole other kettle of fish."

The detail came from EssilorLuxottica CFO Stefano Grassi, who revealed during the eyewear giant’s earnings call last week that Ray-Ban Meta proved to be a significant driver for the company’s sales.
In Europe, Meta has yet to roll out multimodal AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses, citing a lack of clarity from regulators in the EU. The company says it’s committed to bringing all of its Meta AI features to Europe at some point, but the current lack of AI features doesn’t appear to be hindering Ray-Ban Meta’s sales in the region. It’s possible some consumers are drawn to the glasses’ speakers and cameras more than its AI capabilities.
In any case, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses are proving to be a larger success than Meta originally expected. That early traction may have been a factor in Meta expanding its partnership with EssilorLuxottica into the next decade."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/one-zero-the-ai-fintech-started-by-the-founder-of-mobileeye-is-raising-100m-say-sources/,"One Zero, the AI fintech started by the founder of Mobileye, is raising $100M, say sources | TechCrunch",Ingrid Lunden,2024-10-21,"Amnon Shashua, the founder and CEO of Mobileye, has an eye for complicated problems that he believes can be solved with AI, and that AI itself can be fixed to become more reliable. On the sidelines of building and running his self-driving car technology company — which he took public, then sold to Intel, then spun out again — he’s been hatching a number of other ideas.
Now, one of these is raising money and gaining significant momentum.
One Zero, a fintech aiming to use AI in retail banking services, is in the process of raising at least $100 million, TechCrunch has learned.
Despite being co-founded by one of the most high-profile and successful founders in Israel, One Zero has had surprisingly little attention to date outside of its home market. But the company has raised around $242 million so far, and in 2023 it was valued at $320 million, per data in PitchBook. Our sources say that the valuation will be significantly higher in the next round. One local report (published the day after this story was published) estimated the pre-money valuation at between $400 million and $450 million.
It is unclear who the investors are, but previous backers of the company include Tencent, OurCrowd, and SBI Ventures (the now-independent firm that once was a part of SoftBank), as well as Shashua himself.
One Zero’s current efforts to raise money come on the heels of reports that it tried to close a round last year. That round never happened. Meanwhile, the war with Hamas has led to One Zero laying off employees and curtailing international expansion due to the war with Hamas, according to another Israeli outlet.
On the other hand, One Zero’s current growth and efforts to raise more money come amid a frenetic pace of activity for Shashua, who has a non-executive role at the company, with Gal Bar Dea as CEO. In the last couple of years, Shashua has founded or co-founded startups working on humanoid robotics (Mentee) and alternative approaches to large language models for generative AI (AI21), as well as, launched only a couple of weeks ago, AA-I Technologies (pronounced “double AI”), which Shashua describes as his effort to build an “AI scientist. He is also a computer science professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
One Zero’s equally ambitious mission is to “bring private banking to the masses,” he said in an interview. It aims to democratize the kind of high-touch, advisory-type services that high-net-worth individuals get when they bank, in a market where the average person not only doesn’t get that kind of service today, but is staring at a future where there may be no physical bank, and no humans to help, at all.
It’s tackling that ambition by way of a double business focus. In Israel, where One Zero is based, the startup has acquired a banking license and has been building a full-stack retail bank. Alongside this, One Zero is using insights gained from that retail business — which Shashua described in an interview as a “sandbox” — to train its models and hone its technology in order to license that tech to banks operating elsewhere.
The retail business now has around 110,000 customers, Shashua told TechCrunch, and although it has yet to announce any licensing deals so far, the company says it’s received a number of inbound requests from major banks to do so.
The company’s cornerstone so far — and the focus of where it plans to invest its funding — is a chatbot called Ella, which aims to be better than current chatbots while providing services that human bankers could not.
As Shashua sees it, while there have been a number of efforts to build AI into retail banking services, for example around functions like managing spending, they’re limited in what they can do.
“You don’t see banks deploying artificial intelligence to a level in which you are actually replacing a banker,” he said.
As an example, he said, take automated communication. You can ask a banking chatbot very basic questions, such as “how much money is in my account?,” or information about recent transactions, and it can usually answer. But it’s a different story if you ask anything with calculations, such as “how much money will I have in my deposit account at the end of the year based on activity so far?”, or “what is the best way for me to buy a car based on my financial profile?” Not only are chatbots incapable of answering such questions, most personal bankers can’t either.
“There is an opportunity here, where generative AI can, seemingly, do this,” he said. “It goes way beyond spending tracking.”
One Zero’s approach to building such an AI, as Shashua described it, is very ambitious and feels as tricky as self-driving. It focuses on using multiple large language models. Some models may be optimized for different tasks, he said, but running tasks through several LLMs can also provide a diversity of responses, which then are run through a verification process to understand when answers are misleading or wrong.
And if those answers are not verified to be helpful or correct, the AI doesn’t attempt to say something anyway, he said. “It’s okay [for it to] say, I cannot solve your problem. I cannot answer your question,” he said. “Humans also cannot answer every question, right? So it’s okay. It’s not okay to say, here’s an answer to your question, and the answer is completely fake, completely false.”
The system is starting with more basic tasks like spending management and the plan is to add in more functionality over time to help advise customers on financing big purchases or saving money more wisely.

Alcon Entertainment, a production company behind “Blade Runner 2049,” is suing Tesla, Elon Musk, and Warner Bros. Digital for what they claim is a willful circumvention of its IP rights, according to Hollywood Reporter.
Musk had asked to use imagery from the film to promote Tesla’s latest futuristic concept cars at their unveiling on a Warner studio lot. When Alcon wouldn’t agree to provide the rights through Warner, the suit alleges that Tesla, at Musk’s direction, used that imagery as raw material to duplicate it using an AI model. He then showed this fake Blade Runner imagery while talking about the film itself, as you see above.
The lawsuit proposes unspecified damages and also banning Tesla from further distributing the disputed promotional materials."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/nevoya-wants-to-break-the-ev-truck-adoption-logjam/,Nevoya wants to break the EV truck adoption logjam | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-21,"Los Angeles is known for glitz, but there’s also a lot of grit in the air — literally. Thousands of containers are moved off and on ships at the area’s two major ports every day, almost always transferred via pollution-spewing diesel trucks. This has made Los Angeles a hotbed for all kinds of new electric vehicle and charging infrastructure projects.
A new startup called Nevoya is pouncing on the opportunity.
“It’s the best place in the country” for electric trucks, founder Sami Khan told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “The incentives are the strongest,” he remarked, “and there’s just a huge market here.”
It appears Nevoya is already making some headway. The startup’s carrying goods on electric trucks in the LA area for Fortune 500 companies that Khan declined to disclose. Nevoya also revealed to TechCrunch that it raised $3 million in a seed round led by Third Sphere and RedBlue Capital, with Necessary Ventures, Ciri Ventures, and Never Lift coming aboard as well.
Nevoya is billing itself as the “first zero-emissions technology and trucking platform” in the U.S. The startup is exclusively buying electric trucks — all Freightliner eCascadias, so far — to offer to shippers who want to move goods cleanly. It’s also using artificial intelligence software to optimize the usage, routing, and charging of its trucks, which Nevoya says allows it to keep its prices lower than diesel.
Khan and his co-founders make up a triumvirate of complementary expertise that seems appropriate for such an endeavor. Khan spent a few years at McLaren Applied, the British automaker’s innovation arm, but he also spent a half-decade working in private equity. John Verdon led business development and commercial partnerships at Waymo. And Tom Atwood built a predictive analytics startup that sold to supply chain company Project44, where he spent the last two years working on route optimization and infrastructure planning software.
The funding will go toward growing operations, but not to acquiring trucks. Khan said those purchases will be made with debt — a strategy he’s comfortable with following his experiences in private equity. Khan believes this approach also makes Nevoya more attractive to investors in an environment where there’s still a lot of hesitance around hard tech. While he said his team “kissed a lot of frogs,” that process led them to investors like RedBlue — which is run by the former founding partner of transportation startup fund Maniv Mobility, Olaf Sakkers.
“Those guys were people that we had a first conversation with, and within a week it was at a term sheet, because they got it, and they understood,” he said. “The size of the pie, and the opportunity, is so, so huge.”
Khan stressed that competing with diesel trucks on cost will be hard. But that pressure is mitigated by how easy it has been to strike up conversations with companies that ship goods through the LA area.
“All of these Fortune 500 brands are looking to reduce their Scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions) and effectively have no solutions,” he said. With Nevoya, the promise Khan makes to these companies is: “There is no difference to your business, because we take care of the charging. We have the drivers. We have the trucks.”
Even as Nevoya is still working to get to cost parity with diesel, Khan said these big companies almost don’t care. “They want to decarbonize so badly that they are willing to pay a premium, and so for those [customers], we are actually going out at a rate that is higher than diesel.”
“What is so exciting about building this business is that you will get through the door at any shipper in the United States,” Khan said. “We have not failed there once — as soon as you say you have electric vehicles, they pick up the phone. They escalate.”
As it signs on more companies, Nevoya’s software can efficiently piggyback shipments from different customers to get the most out of the electric trucks in its fleet. That helps it lower costs.
Khan said Nevoya is currently hopping around different charging locations — this is another place where the optimization software will really have to shine — but eventually wants to build its own charging infrastructure. At that point, Khan said he could see Nevoya moving into smaller-class trucks, too.
Nevoya is also eyeing geographic expansion in the United States. It’s starting that push with a market that is about as different as its home base as one can find: Texas.
Despite the myriad social and political differences, Khan views Texas as a similarly well-suited state to drum up business. It may not have the pot-of-gold incentives like California, but Khan said Texas’ looser regulatory framework and cheaper electricity put it on par with the financial modeling his team has done for operating in Nevoya’s home state."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/benchmark-is-raising-170m-for-its-latest-partners-only-fund/,Benchmark is raising $170M for its latest partners-only fund | TechCrunch,"Marina Temkin, Julie Bort",2024-10-21,"While fund sizes of many venture capital firms have ballooned into billions of dollars over the last decade, Benchmark Partners, one of Silicon Valley’s most successful investors, has stuck to raising approximately $425 million in capital every few years.
That’s what the storied firm told in a letter to its limited partners when it announced its latest fund this summer, reported The Information. However, Benchmark’s partners are not limiting themselves to whatever capital commitment they make for their main investment fund. The firm is currently raising an additional $170 million for a fund called Benchmark Partners Founders’ Fund I, according to two regulatory filings.
Benchmark isn’t quietly asking its LPs to contribute more funding to a new strategy. TechCrunch understands that $170 million is expected to come primarily from the firm’s partners, past and present, with some availability for their friends and family to join too. This isn’t new, a source familiar with the fund says. The partners-only fund has been a strategy from its early days.
While it is not unusual, and often a requirement, that partners contribute their personal capital alongside LPs into their main funds, it is more rare that a firm has a large separate fund composed almost entirely of partners’ own money.
But Benchmark is not an ordinary VC firm. It was an early investor in companies like eBay, Snap, Uber, and Twitter, and has returned billions to its backers over those years, often multiplying the original funds by as much as tenfold, according to reports from Forbes and The Information.
So its partners have every reason to want to double down on their investments. A separate fund allows them to do so in a way that doesn’t involve managing limited partners’ money. They aren’t the only VCs to think like that. Homebrew, the VC firm founded by Satya Patel (known for his time at Twitter, Battery Ventures, and Google) and Hunter Walk (YouTube, Google), quit taking limited partner money altogether in 2022. Homebrew’s main fund is now their own money. Sequoia’s separate wealth management firm, Sequoia Heritage, was also famously seeded with $150 million apiece from partner Michael Moritz and Doug Leone, although it took on $250 million from outside investors, too.
Benchmark has always operated less like the giant VC firms. It is, for instance, an equal partnership firm, which means each partner shares an equal percentage of the outfit’s management fees and profits. The firm invests primarily in Series A-stage companies for around 20% ownership and is so sought after, its website is little more than a landing page."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/x-rolls-out-its-real-time-search-tool-radar-to-premium-subscribers/,"X rolls out its real-time search tool, Radar, to Premium+ subscribers | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-10-21,"As competition from newcomers like Bluesky and Threads increases, X launched a “Radar” trend analysis tool that aims to offer subscribers real-time insights into emerging trends and conversations on the platform.
The tool, previously known as Insights, was initially targeted at Verified Organizations (businesses), allowing marketers to track topics and trends on the app. If subscribed, marketers could perform keyword analytics, visualize trend activity, and filter conversations in real time. In addition to tracking conversation volume over time, Radar can also track conversation velocity. Its features help marketers better understand trends on X and could help them plan the best time to post to reach their desired audience.
While Insights could have potentially replaced the need for a third-party trend-tracking tool, its price point — $1,000 per month or $833.33 per month if billed annually — had put it out of reach for smaller businesses.
Now rebranded as Radar, X’s trend analysis tool will begin rolling out to Premium+ subscribers, starting Monday. This high-end subscription on X offers a handful of extra features like a verified checkmark, the ability to edit posts, an ad-free experience, and more for $16 per month or $168 per year, when subscribing via the web.
Today, we’re expanding the roll-out of Radar, our real-time trend analysis tool (formerly known as Insights).
With Radar, you can be among the first to spot emerging trends as they happen.
Access is rolling out to select Premium+ users starting today. This is an early version… pic.twitter.com/OO4ye4WIoX
— Premium (@premium) October 18, 2024

In a post on X, the company notes that Radar will be released as an early version, with more updates on the way. However, only select subscribers will immediately gain access to Radar, X says.
Some had already spotted Radar’s arrival earlier this month, teasing it as a more powerful search tool. The tool was officially launched on Friday, and then announced on Monday via the X Premium X account.
Earlier adopters of the new Radar search feature have commented that its search algorithm is much improved, but at least one user pointed to remaining issues, like the inability to search further back than three days. Other improvements they suggested include more filtering options and integration with X Pro, the desktop X app that used to be known as TweetDeck."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/content-kleptocracy-news-corp-outlets-sue-perplexity-over-scraped-stories/,'Content kleptocracy': News Corp outlets sue Perplexity over scraped stories | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-21,"News Corp’s Dow Jones and the NY Post have sued growing AI startup Perplexity over what they describe as a “content kleptocracy.”
In a lawsuit filed in New York on Monday, the media organization claimed that Perplexity engages in copyright violations on a “grand scale,” simultaneously duplicating and misrepresenting original content created by others:
Its AI “answer engine” copies on a massive scale, among other things, copyrighted news content, analysis, and opinion as inputs into its internal database. It then uses that copyrighted content to generate responses to users’ queries that are intended to and do act as a substitute for news and other information websites. Perplexity loudly touts that its answers to user queries are so reliable that its users can “Skip the Links” to the original publishers and instead rely wholly on Perplexity for their news and analysis needs. What Perplexity does not tout is that its core business model involves engaging in massive freeriding on Plaintiffs’ protected content to compete against Plaintiffs for the engagement of the same news-consuming audience, and in turn to deprive Plaintiffs of critical revenue sources.
News Corp is far from the first to make this claim. Many news sites have expressed concerns that Perplexity closely replicates their content, with the occasionally egregious example, as with a piece that Forbes called out this summer. Just last week, The New York Times sent a cease and desist to Perplexity.
Perplexity, for its part, tends to characterize its web scrapers as collecting data not for inclusion in AI training but simply as an index for its models to refer to when attempting to answer a user’s question.
We’ve asked the company for comment and will update this post if we hear back. (Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas posted a Perplexity ad topping the front page of the Wall Street Journal, named in the suit.)
The fast-moving industry has skirted copyright law in general, but the unprecedented nature of large-scale AI agents and scrapers means that existing rules may not apply as one might intuitively expect. A number of lawsuits are in process alleging various forms of copyright infringement, but so far none has reached a conclusion. Each no doubt hopes it is filing the landmark lawsuit that breaks the back of big AI.
“We applaud principled companies like OpenAI, which understands that integrity and creativity are essential if we are to realise the potential of Artificial Intelligence,” wrote News Corp CEO Robert Thomson in a statement. (News Corp signed a lucrative multiyear content deal with OpenAI earlier this year.)
“Perplexity is not the only AI company abusing intellectual property and it is not the only AI company that we will pursue with vigor and rigor,” continued the statement. “We have made clear that we would rather woo than sue, but, for the sake of our journalists, our writers and our company, we must challenge the content kleptocracy.”
News Corp seeks $150,000 per infringement, plus Perplexity’s profits on them, among other remedies, which could lead to astronomical damages depending on how the evidence is interpreted."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/poshmark-reverses-decision-to-lower-selling-fees-after-sellers-experience-drop-in-sales/,Poshmark reverses decision to lower selling fees after sellers experience a drop in sales  | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-10-21,"Shortly after the social marketplace Poshmark announced it would lower selling fees and increase fees for buyers, the company decided to revert to its original fee structure following outrage among sellers.
In an email to sellers sent on Monday (and viewed by TechCrunch), founder and CEO Manish Chandra wrote an apology about the fee change, saying it resulted in shoppers spending less on purchases, “leaving our sellers with less cash in their pockets—despite the seller fee reduction.”
Chandra added, “The outcome of the change did not meet our expectations, and I sincerely apologize for the disruption and impact that this has had on you.”
Earlier this month, Poshmark introduced a new fee structure to replace the original 20% seller fee. The new structure included a 5.99% fee for sellers and a 5.99% “protection fee” for buyers. Additionally, both buyers and sellers were required to pay an extra $1, $2, or $3 based on the total order amount. For example, orders under $15 incur a $1 fee, orders between $15 and $50 incur a $2 fee, and orders over $50 incur a $3 fee. Buyers are still responsible for covering shipping costs.
Many sellers expressed their disappointment on Reddit about the new system, stating that their sales had significantly decreased, possibly due to customers abandoning purchases after seeing the new fee. One Redditor mentioned that they used to make “12-15 sales” per week but were now making fewer than than five.
Poshmark is not the first resale platform to face this kind of backlash. In March, Mercari began eliminating seller fees completely and charging buyers a service fee for “hassle-free returns.” Not surprisingly, people were unhappy, and Mercari reversed part of its policy after just two months.
Poshmark’s original fee structure will become effective this Thursday, October 24. It’s also issuing sellers a rebate for the difference in seller fees on listings created or edited during the fee change period (October 3 to October 23) and sold from October 24 through October 27."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/xai-elon-musks-ai-startup-launches-an-api/,"xAI, Elon Musk's AI startup, launches an API | TechCrunch",Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-21,"In August, Elon Musk’s xAI promised to make Grok, the company’s flagship generative AI model powering a number of features on X, available via an API. Now, that API has arrived — albeit a bit bare-bones at the moment.
The xAI API only has a single model, “grok-beta,” priced at $5 per million input tokens (~750,000 words) or $15 per million output tokens. Tokens are subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables “fan,” “tas,” and “tic” in the word “fantastic.”
It’s unclear which Grok model “grok-beta” might be; Grok 2 is the very latest on X. The documentation for the API refers to Grok 2 and Grok mini, a lightweight and more affordable version of Grok — so it could well be a technical issue.
Some users on X also reported encountering problems paying for usage credits.
The xAI API supports function calling, which connects Grok models to external tools such as databases and search engines. And, although they don’t appear to be live yet, the documentation hints at vision models capable of analyzing both text and images.
Musk formed xAI last year. Soon after, the company — which recently moved into OpenAI’s old offices — released its first Grok model on X to X Premium+ users, who pay $16 a month.
Grok has what Musk has described as “a rebellious streak” — a willingness to answer “spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.” Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok will happily oblige, spewing profanities and colorful language you won’t hear from ChatGPT.
Grok has become increasingly ingrained in the X experience. Thanks to an integration with the open image generator Flux, Grok can generate images on X (without guardrails, controversially). It summarizes news and trending events (often with mistakes, mind you), and it may enhance X’s search capabilities, account bios, post analytics, and reply functions in the future.
xAI is sprinting to catch up to formidable competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic in the generative AI race. In May, xAI raised $6 billion in a funding round led by investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Fidelity.
Musk often asserts that X’s data gives xAI a substantial leg up compared to rivals. This month, X changed its privacy policy to allow third parties, including xAI, to train models on X posts.
As part of the pitch for xAI’s $6 billion funding round, the startup also outlined a vision where its models would be trained on data from Musk’s various companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and The Boring Company, and its models could then improve technology across those companies.
Tesla shareholders, for one, weren’t on board with that plan. Several sued Musk over the decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted both talent and resources from Tesla to what is essentially a competing venture.
Musk said this summer that xAI is training the next generation of Grok models at its Memphis data center, which has been accused of worsening smog with unauthorized turbines. The company hopes to upgrade the data center next year, but will need approval from the Tennessee Valley Authority in order to do so."

Across TikTok and Instagram, the startup behind a new messaging app aimed at Gen Z has seen around 48 million combined views. Prelaunch, the app’s waitlist is already bursting with roughly 156,000 sign-ups.
Driving the demand for this next-generation alternative to iMessage and WhatsApp isn’t some smooth-talking influencer or paid advertising, but simply product demo videos of the app in action, which have impressed a younger audience.
Theres a troll on the next stop… #collage #drawing #textingmycrush #creative #brat #relationshipadvice #chat
Founded by New York-based serial entrepreneur Willem Simons, Daze offers a freestyle messaging app that takes its clues from social media. Similar to crafting an Instagram story using a variety of fonts, styles, graphics, and more, users’ chats are no longer limited to blue and green bubbles. Instead, multi-colored messages can float across the screen complemented by photos, graphics, stickers, GIFs, drawings, decorated backgrounds, and more.
In addition, the app is currently leveraging AI to help power some of its creative tools; it plans to deeply integrate more AI-based technology in the future.
“Our goal with Daze has been to make a feature complete messenger that is competitive with iMessage, WhatsApp, etc., while still having a suite of really fun and creative features,” Simons told TechCrunch. “You can quickly type a message and press send, or drag the message anywhere within the chat. It is easy to use and utilitarian, but also very free and unconstrained.”
This isn’t the first time Simons has experimented with this idea. For several years, ending in 2022, he was working on an app with a similar vibe called Muze. Like Daze, Muze redesigned mobile messaging as a free-form canvas for creativity with a similar set of tools. But while Muze was jointly founded by Simons along with Douglas Witte and Grant Davis with Fenner Stevens as CEO, Daze is solely Simons’ project.
They dont love you like i love you #messaging #collage #creative #drawing #chat #texting #art #friends #couples
The new app, which is a pivot from Daze’s beginnings as a social calendar, has been built entirely in React Native to ensure it could launch simultaneously on iOS and Android. Currently, Daze’s launch is scheduled for November 4. Ahead of this, the app has been in early testing with around 1,400 invite-only beta users.
While beta metrics still have to be proven out in the real world, one promising figure shared by a source familiar with the company’s tests indicates that Daze’s 60-day retention for people who have sent a message on the app is more than 50%.
Not surprisingly, this free-form messenger is skewing younger, with most testers falling in the 13- to 22-year-old demographic, Simons notes.
The startup’s team of seven full-time staff and one part-time are largely based in New York, with only a few people working remotely.
Prelaunch, Daze has raised $5.7 million in funding from a16z, Kindred Ventures, Alpaca Ventures, Uncommon Projects, Betaworks, Maveron, 35 Ventures, New Wave, Antoine Martin, and others."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/shobizzy-networking-app-for-freelancers-in-tv-film-industry/,"ShoBizzy, a networking app for the TV industry, aims to open new doors for freelancers | TechCrunch",Lauren Forristal,2024-10-21,"With the current unemployment crisis in Hollywood, many TV and film crew members are concerned about finding their next job. This is particularly the case for freelancers, who often face unstable work and irregular pay.
ShoBizzy is the latest professional networking app for the entertainment industry that aims to address this challenge. And, as more workers could be at risk of being out of a job, ShoBizzy recently expanded its offering to allow users to pursue opportunities in additional areas like live events and content creation.
Launched in January, the app sets itself apart from traditional job-post boards such as Backstage and StaffMeUp because it doesn’t require users to fill out applications. Instead, it provides a social platform for freelancers to create public profiles showcasing their skills and expertise, as well as form long-lasting connections with people in the business who can serve as valuable references for future job opportunities.
“Freelancers live a very non-traditional career path, in terms of the fact that we never have a permanent employer, and it ends up being that your network is the most valuable piece to your career because of the fact that it’s such a who-you-know business,” co-founder Doug Weitzbuch told TechCrunch. Weitzbuch is a freelance TV producer with 20 years of industry experience and has worked on shows like “Duck Dynasty,” “Hell’s Kitchen,” and “Lip Sync Battle.”
It’s a smart move to allow freelancers to broaden their horizons beyond TV and film, as there has been a lot of interest in the creator economy, which is estimated to be a $250 billion business. There has also been a surge in live events this past year. PwC predicts that live event revenue in the U.S. is set to reach $68.7 billion in 2024.
“The television industry has been in the downturn this past year, and a lot of people are struggling to find work,” co-founder Kevin Eberly said, who previously founded PayYourRent, the online rent payment software company. “As we’re building [ShoBizzy], we had a lot of interest from two tangential verticals. One is live event production, so things like concerts, tours, and festivals. And the other is digital content, you know, YouTube creators and stuff like that…We’re able to offer opportunities to freelance crew that they potentially never would have thought of on their own.”
Eberly added that the company currently has “strong relationships with multiple companies in the live event vertical, including Red Light Management, that are eager to bring the platform to their productions and clients.”
The new partnership with Red Light Management is significant because the company represents many well-known artists, such as Luke Bryan, Sabrina Carpenter, The Black Keys, The Fray, The Strokes, and Tom Petty. This potentially gives freelancers the chance to work on major projects that could help advance their careers.
Alongside the expansion, ShoBizzy added new functionality to help live event companies manage hires more easily. The app’s production workflow is now tailored to concert tours, allowing companies to add multiple dates and locations in a single production. It also lets companies match with any vendors they may need, such as camera rental vendors.
Overall, ShoBizzy’s suite of tools for production companies aims to streamline the hiring process. Using an AI-powered algorithm, the app suggests the best-fitting individuals for each role, considering factors such as the production’s location, current availability, and relevant IMDb credits. It then tracks the progress of hires in real time as the crew is assembled. Companies can also message crew members in the app.
Since its launch, ShoBizzy has grabbed the attention of 6,500 signups and around 650 companies, including A&E, Amazon, Disney+, Discovery Channel, Food Network, Netflix, Nike, and the WNBA, among others.
The company is currently raising a $2 million seed funding round."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/ireland-adopts-online-safety-code-for-video-sharing-platforms-including-tiktok/,Ireland adopts Online Safety Code for video-sharing platforms including TikTok | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-21,"Ireland’s media and internet watchdog, Coimisiún na Meán, has adopted and published an Online Safety Code that will apply to video-sharing platforms headquartered in the country from next month (November 19) — including the likes of ByteDance’s TikTok, Google-owned YouTube, and Meta’s Instagram and Facebook Reels.
Under the Code, in-scope platforms are required to have terms and conditions that ban uploads or sharing of a range of harmful content types — including cyberbullying; promoting self-harm or suicide and promoting eating or feeding disorders, in addition to banning content that incites hatred or violence, terrorism, child sex abuse material (CSAM), and racism and xenophobia.
The aim of the Code is to address content types that are not directly in scope of the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA), Coimisiún na Meán spokesman, Adam Hurley confirmed.
The latter, a pan-EU law, has applied broadly since mid February and is focused on online governance of illegal content (e.g. CSAM), rather than tackling the wider sweep of harms Coimisiún na Meán’s Code aims to address.
“One of the thoughts behind the Online Safety Code is dealing with content which is more harmful rather than illegal,” Hurley told us, adding: “What we’ve done is broaden the scope to harmful content that they must prohibit uploading of and then act on reports against those terms and conditions.”
“It’s a prohibition on uploading in their terms and conditions. So they have to prohibit the uploading of these types of content in their own terms and conditions, and then they’ll have to enforce those terms and conditions,” he added.
The Code will directly apply only to video services provided to users in Ireland, including several major social media platforms that fall under its scope due to their regional headquarters being in the country. However, tech firms may choose to apply the same measures across the rest of the region to streamline compliance and avoid awkward questions about inconsistencies in content standards.
“They are required to protect all users of their services across Europe by putting in place the measures required by the Code, where appropriate further to Part A of the Code and as required by specific provisions of the Code set out at Part B,” Coimisiún na Meán told us.
In all, there are nine video-sharing platforms designated by Coimisiún na Meán: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, Tumblr, Udemy, X and YouTube.
Penalties for breaches of the Code are substantial: the Irish regulator can impose fines of up to 10% of a platform’s annual turnover (or €20 million, whichever is greater).
Another noteworthy element here is that EU law prohibits imposing a general monitoring obligation on platforms. So Ireland’s Online Safety Code will not require platforms to deploy upload filters, per Hurley. Rather, he confirmed it’s essentially an expansion of the existing notice and take down approach — by allowing users to also report harmful content and expect platforms will remove it.
Much like the DSA, the Code therefore requires platforms to have ways for people to report the aforementioned harmful content types in order that they can act on reports in line with their T&Cs.
In further requirements, the Code mandates that video sites which permit pornographic content or gratuitous violence in their T&Cs must apply “appropriate” age assurance (or age verification) in a bid to ensure minors do not access inappropriate content.
Hurley said there are no approved age assurance technologies per se; rather, the regulator will assess what’s appropriate on a case-by-case basis.
The Code also requires video-sharing platforms that carry such content to establish user-friendly content rating systems.
Platforms must also provide parental controls for any content which may “impair the physical, mental, or moral development of children under 16,” as the Coimisiún na Meán’s press release puts it.
On recommender systems, the Irish regulator previously considered requiring video-sharing platforms to turn off profiling-based content recommendations by default as a safety measure — which could have led to a scenario where TikTok was forced to switch off its algorithm by default.
However, after a consultation last year, the measure did not make it into the final Code, the Coimisiún na Meán’s spokesman confirmed. “It was considered as a potential supplementary [to the Code] but we’ve come down on the position that the best way to deal with recommender systems — the potential harm of recommender systems — is through the [EU’s] Digital Services Act,” he told TechCrunch.
We’ve asked the regulator how the Code will therefore mitigate harms driven through algorithmic amplification, which is another stated aim. Update: It told us: “The Online Safety Code does not address recommender systems however we recognise that recommender systems can have harmful impacts on users, especially children. Under our Online Safety Framework, Coimisiún na Meán will be best able to tackle the potential dangers through our implementation of the Digital Services Act.”
The finalized Code forms a part of Ireland’s overall Online Safety Framework which aims to ensure digital services are accountable for protecting users from online harm — which falls under the country’s Online Safety and Media Regulation Act.
The EU’s DSA applies around the bloc so is also in force in Ireland, with the Coimisiún na Meán responsible for enforcing the regulation’s general rules on any locally headquartered companies in scope — in addition to overseeing the new Online Safety Code.
Commenting in a statement, Ireland’s Online Safety Commissioner, Niamh Hodnett, said: “The adoption of the Online Safety Code brings an end to the era of social media self-regulation. The Code sets binding rules for video-sharing platforms to follow in order to reduce the harm they can cause to users. We will work to make sure that people know their rights when they go online and we will hold the platforms to account and take action when platforms don’t live up to their obligations.”
In another supporting statement, executive chairperson of Coimisiún na Meán, Jeremy Godfrey, added: “With the adoption of the Online Safety Code, all the elements of our Online Safety Framework are now in place. Our focus now is on fully implementing the Framework and driving positive changes in peoples’ lives online.
“Our message to people is clear: if you come across something you think is illegal or against a platform’s own rules for what they allow, you should report it directly to the platform. Our Contact Centre is available to provide advice and guidance to people if they need help.”
Child safety concerns are behind a growing number of online safety initiatives on both sides of the Atlantic in recent years. This includes the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (which passed into law just over a year ago) and an Age-Appropriate Design Code (which begun being enforced in the U.K. in fall 2021). A child safety-focused bill is also progressing in the U.S. (KOSA). It was proposed back in 2022.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/uprise-wants-to-help-small-businesses-make-better-financial-decisions/,Uprise wants to help small businesses make better financial decisions | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-10-21,"Small business creation has been on the rise in the U.S. since the pandemic. There are a lot of tech tools designed to help these companies with things like payroll or setting up retirement benefits — but more tools doesn’t mean small businesses know how to use them to make smart decisions.
Uprise is looking to change that. The startup looks to serve as a financial advisor to these small businesses. It embeds itself into financial service products SMBs are already using, like HR tech company Rippling and SMB tax startup Carry, and gives companies recommendations of what they should do. For example, Uprise could recommend which type of retirement benefit a company should offer based on its size and location.
Recommendations come from an AI algorithm that looks at information about the specific company in addition to data points collected from the financial service institutes the person is accessing Uprise from. Nanthakumar Muthusamy, Uprise’s co-founder and head of engineering (pictured above left with co-founders Jennifer Chen Riolfi [center] and Chris Goodmacher [right]), told TechCrunch that all of the platform’s recommendations get vetted through a human financial advisor.
“We believe that humans should be in the loop before you talk to a customer,” Muthusamy said. “They also like to talk to a human more than a machine.”
While Uprise is focused on small businesses now, the original concept was giving financial advice to consumers. Jessica Chen Riolfi, Uprise co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that the idea for the company came to her after working in numerous roles at fintech companies like Wise and Robinhood where she realized consumers had the same issue making smart decisions.
She connected with Chris Goodmacher, an OnDeck fellow who had noticed the same dilemma while working at fintech companies like JustWorks, and got started. Muthusamy joined the group shortly after.
The first iteration of Uprise was launched in private beta in 2022 as a direct-to-consumer strategy that was built for individuals making personal financial decisions. While that product is still available, the company decided to pivot to focus on small businesses when they realized that their most engaged users were individuals, like entrepreneurs and freelancers, looking to get advice for both them and their small business.
“Traditional finance, it doesn’t have a great solution for them,” Chen Riolfi said of these individuals. “If you walk into any traditional bank, it’s like for your business needs go here and for your personal needs go here, and the two sides don’t talk to each other. But that doesn’t reflect the reality of a small business owner. My business finances are my finances.”
The company pivoted toward small businesses and soon started getting inbound requests from fintech companies about embedding their tech into their platforms. Uprise has been operating in beta since 2023 with five customers and is now fully launching with more partnerships in the works.
The San Francisco-based company just raised a $3.3 million seed round led by Blank Ventures with participation from Graham & Walker, Hustle Fund and Dash Fund, among other VCs. It also raised from numerous angel investors from the fintech world, including Dan Macklin, the co-founder of SoFi, and Eddie Kim, the co-founder of Gusto.
“All of the investors who did come in know the space really deeply,” Chen Riolfi said. “The thread through this entire journey is we didn’t have to convince them there was a need [for this].”
The company plans to use the money to help fully launch the product and to land more partnerships.
“Our vision for what embedded financial advisory means is if you are a small business owner and you have a folder of financial apps, we want to be integrated into all of those apps,” Chen Riolfi said. “We know the context and know what you should be doing there.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/a-closer-look-at-the-airpods-pros-new-hearing-aid-feature/,A closer look at the AirPods Pro’s new hearing aid features | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-21,"In November 2022, the FDA passed a resolution allowing Americans to purchase hearing aids over-the-counter. The move launched a mini-industry, with companies rushing to make available technology that was previously mired in healthcare restrictions.
Consumer electronics firms saw opportunity, as well. In September, Apple announced that it would be bringing hearing aid features to the AirPods Pro 2, as part of an upcoming iOS update.
I had the opportunity to test a demo version of the feature at the iPhone 16 event. The offering was designed to provide insight into how users can test their hearing at home, though those results were incomplete. More recently, however, Apple gave TechCrunch access to the upcoming feature in its final form.
I confess to being a bit anxious. I’ve had tinnitus my entire life, and while I’m pretty good about packing earplugs, I was fairly convinced that decades of rock shows had taken their toll on my overall hearing health.
As these processes go, however, Apple’s new Hearing Test feature is painless. It’s been far too long since I’ve had any manner of formal testing, but the feature immediately transported me back to elementary school tests. Wait to hear a tone and hold up the corresponding hand. You get the drift.
The feature is immediately accessible from the Settings menu when you have a pair of AirPods Pro 2 connected and in your ears. At the moment, the feature is only available on that specific model. This is because they’re the only member of the AirPods family with both the new chip and a silicone tip for passive noise canceling. Absolute silence is the key, after all. The tones are faint, easily masked by the slightest bit of ambient noise.
After a few basic questions — Are you over 18? Did you attend a loud concert in the past 24 hours? — the system will play a generic piece of music to ensure that the AirPods fit is correct. If the seal is out of place, the system will prompt you to fix it before testing again.
Next up, the test monitors the room for absolute silence. The first time I tried it, I was informed my environment was too loud. Turns out the air filter in the corner of the room was loud enough to set it off. Once the room is silent, the test will start. Just my luck, however, a guy was fertilizing the lawn outside. He rode by my window every 45 seconds, and each time the test paused and waited for things to quiet down.
The hearing test goes one ear at a time, starting with the left. The system then runs through a series of tones, twice apiece. When you hear the tone, you tap the screen. It’s pretty much as simple as that. The test isn’t measuring the speed with which you tap the screen — just whether you tap it each time.
The tones run through a range of frequencies to determine which parts of your range may be impacted by hearing loss. The whole process takes around five minutes, all told.
The results populate quickly. I was surprised when my results came back as “little to no hearing loss.” The app rated my left at 18 dBHL (decibel hearing loss) and my right at 19. Mild hearing loss kicks in around 25 dbHL. The hearing aid feature will only be available to those who test within the bounds of mild to moderate hearing loss.
If your hearing loss is more severe, Apple recommends you get a professional test. If you test within the normal range, on the other hand, the system will offer the ability to turn on Media Assist. The new feature amplifies certain elements like speech, distinguishing them from background noise. It’s similar to the new Hearing Aid feature in that it’s meant to improve one’s day-to-day life, though the amplifications aren’t as pronounced.
Even still, the feature takes a bit getting used to. I found that some things, like the sound of fabric rubbing against fabric while walking, was significantly more noticeable than normal. In more chaotic environments, it’s a genuinely useful feature — once you get through the societal norm of taking your headphones out to speak with someone.
That may well be the biggest challenge for the feature. We’re used to hearing aids. If you see someone wearing one, you assume they’re living with some degree of hearing loss. If the same person were using AirPods and didn’t bother to take at least one out before engaging with you in conversation, you would probably consider them rude.
As barriers go, however, this bit of social nicety is something a quick explanation can address. It’s a small price to pay for a technology that could fundamentally improve lives."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/groww-pays-160m-tax-as-it-returns-to-india-amid-a-startup-relocation-wave/,Groww pays $160M tax as it returns to India amid a startup relocation wave | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-10-21,"Indian stock trading and mutual fund startup Groww paid $159.4 million in taxes as it shifted its domicile from the U.S. back to India, the company said in a statement on Monday.
Nearly a dozen Indian startups are in the process of relocating their headquarters to India from the U.S. and Singapore to better comply with Indian laws and facilitate IPOs in the country. The shift in domicile creates a tax event for both investors and the startup.
While the IPO market remains subdued in the U.S. and many developed markets, India has emerged as a hotbed for public offerings this year. The first nine months of 2024 saw almost 70 IPOs in India, already the second-highest number of offerings in any calendar year on record.
One key reason for the influx of startups returning to India is the potential for better analyst coverage, even for companies valued below $2 billion. This coverage is crucial for attracting institutional investors. Hundreds of Indian startups — many of them backed by accelerator Y Combinator — chose to base their headquarters in the U.S. in the past decade."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/datacrunch-wants-to-be-europes-first-ai-cloud-hyperscaler-powered-by-renewable-energy/,DataCrunch wants to be Europe's first AI cloud hyperscaler — powered by renewable energy | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-21,"A fledgling startup is setting out to become one of Europe’s first “AI compute” hyperscalers, with renewable energy playing a pivotal part in its pitch to prospective customers.
The AI gold rush has spurred unprecedented demand for “compute,” which refers to the processing power, infrastructure, and resources needed for tasks such as running algorithms, executing machine learning models, and processing data. One of the big beneficiaries of this demand has been Nvidia, emerging as a $3 trillion powerhouse off the back of demand for its GPU (graphics processing units) and associated AI hardware.
In tandem, an industry of cloud infrastructure providers has sprung up off the back of Nvidia, raising bucket loads of cash en route. In the U.S., we’ve seen the likes of Lambda and CoreWeave hit lofty billion-dollar valuations to expand their data center operations. Now, Finnish startup DataCrunch is throwing its hat into the ring, touting itself as one of the “few serious players” in the space with all operations in Europe.
Founded in 2020 by CEO Ruben Bryon, DataCrunch — like its peers — sells GPUs “as-a-service,” promising to reduce the costs for AI processing. The company today said it has raised $13 million in seed funding, constituting $7.6 million in equity financing from backers such as byFounders, J12 Ventures, and Aiven co-founder Oskari Saarenmaa. The remaining $5.4 million debt segment hails from LokalTapiola and Nordea.
While it’s slightly unusual for a seed-stage startup to raise such a significant portion as debt, DataCrunch has done this for the exact same reason that others in the space, such as CoreWeave, have also been raising hefty amounts of debt. It’s all about using physical assets — e.g. Nvidia GPUs — as collateral to secure loans, rather than giving away more equity.
It’s also more efficient to secure large buckets of capital this way, as the banks can simply take away the GPUs if things go belly-up for DataCrunch. For those who control the purse strings, it’s much less riskier than investing in a pure-play SaaS startup, for instance.
“Given the business that we’re in, our main expenses for expansion are capex [capital expenditure] driven,” Bryon told TechCrunch. “This is the logical way to go about it, and as we grow, additional access to that financing becomes available.”
This new round takes DataCrunch’s total funding raised since inception to $18 million, and will go some way toward helping it build out its infrastructure to support Nvidia’s latest servers and clusters, including the shiny new H200 GPU. In turn, this will help it grow a customer base that not only includes corporate clients such as Sony, but individual AI researchers working at the likes of OpenAI.
“That has always been an important market for us, and I think that this ‘individual’ market has been left behind by many,” Bryon said. “For me, personally, it’s important — at the weekend, I’m often using our own services, and have been since the beginning.”
Indeed, flexible, on-demand pricing is a far more alluring proposition for independent researchers and developers who might just need a little bit of compute for personal or university projects.
“People who are studying for a Masters or a PhD — that’s a segment we want to stay connected to because it’s often people who are a few years away from doing something really great,” Bryon said.
Hook them in now, and reap the rewards later when they hit the big time. That’s the general gist.
But there’s no escaping the giant elephant in the room, one that all the cloud companies are having to reckon with: the gargantuan amount of energy required to power this AI revolution.
Part of DataCrunch’s “advantage” is the fact that its data centers are located in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, and Iceland — a country running on 100% renewable energy for years already.
“In Helsinki, we can subscribe to green energy from the grid,” Bryon said. “And currently, in one of our two Finnish data centers, the waste heat is captured to heat up Helsinki itself. In Iceland, we have the advantage that the ambient air temperature is always low, while the energy mix on the grid is already 100% green. So Iceland is pretty much one of the greenest places in the world to have these kinds of operations.”
This will be a big focal point for the company moving forward. While it plans to offer its services to any company globally, it will mostly remain anchored in the Nordics and Iceland. “Perhaps in the future we’ll look at Canada if we can find suitable locations, where we can have a similar advantage in terms of carbon footprint of our operations,” Bryon said.
It’s these “green” credentials that DataCrunch hopes will also set it apart from other European rivals: companies like FlexAI in France, which recently exited stealth with $30 million in seed funding; and Nebius, which recently emerged from the ashes of Russian internet giant Yandex and has just become a public company again.
There is a trade-off here, though: While low latency is often one of the big selling points for AI compute providers, DataCrunch isn’t necessarily going to be in that bucket, which means it will be better suited for a particular kind of workload.
“Our strategy is such that we’re not going to be the provider with the absolute lowest latency due to being in 100 locations around the world,” Bryon said. “We are more focused on the compute that doesn’t have that strict latency requirement. We can still have a decent enough latency though; it might not be 10 milliseconds, but it will still be something like 100 milliseconds.”
It’s also worth noting that DataCrunch’s data centers are in shared “co-location” facilities for now, but the company says it’s planning to start building out its own data centers in 2025 — something it will need significantly more capital for.
“I want us to be on a path toward going public with this company, and we’ll need access to plenty more capital to keep expanding the company,” Bryon said.

If a deal happens with those terms, it would more than double Perplexity’s valuation from its $3 billion valuation when it raised from SoftBank over the summer. The WSJ reports that the company currently receives about 15 million queries a day and brings in around $50 million in annualized revenue.
Perplexity uses AI to help people search the web in a chatbot-style interface. Some news publishers have accused the company of unauthorized web scraping and plagiarism, and The New York Times has even sent Perplexity a cease-and-desist letter, but CEO Aravind Srinivas said he wants to work with publishers and has “no interest in being anyone’s antagonist here.”
These fundraising talks come after OpenAI announced raising a $6.6 billion round at a $157 billion valuation. While products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have blurred the line between chatbot and search engine, the company is moving more directly into search with SearchGPT.
A Perplexity spokesperson declined to comment on the WSJ report."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/20/women-in-ai-marissa-hummon-thinks-ai-will-help-make-the-power-grid-greener/,Women in AI: Marissa Hummon thinks AI will help make the power grid greener | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-10-20,"As a part of TechCrunch’s ongoing Women in AI series, which seeks to give AI-focused women academics and others their well-deserved — and overdue — time in the spotlight, TechCrunch interviewed Marissa Hummon, the chief technology officer at the energy company Utilidata, where she is working to make the electric grid more sustainable.
“The work that I’m doing at Utilidata is pushing against the status quo of the utility industry,” Hummon told TechCrunch, adding that AI is poised to help the utility sector operate more effectively. “It will give utilities the tools they need to operate a clean, modern, and reliable grid that will better serve the people and businesses connected to it.”
Hummon started her career at the National Renewable Energy Lab, where she focused on how to move the energy industry away from carbon-intensive solutions to more clean sources. She recalled having to take a new modeling approach because certain physics equations were “unsolvable using traditional analytic methods.”
“Instead we needed to use numerical methods and machine learning,” she said. This was back in 2010.
Hummon moved her way up, working at the energy company Tendril before landing the CTO role at Utilidata, a position she’s held since 2018. She received a PhD in applied physics from Harvard and said that as she made the transition from grad school into the engineering field, she noticed a significant drop in the number of women working in the field. “I’ve often felt the pressure of being held to a higher standard in the workplace compared to my male peers,” she said.
Hummon said now as a leader she tries to lead by example and create opportunities for women to lead and be recognized. At the same time, men need to be responsible for creating space for more women to enter and stay in the field, she said.
“The change we need is not just in practice; it must be systemic and widespread,” she continued. “It starts with recruiting and hiring, continues with mentoring and coaching, and culminates with fair and equitable recognition and promotion — all while creating a safe and inclusive workplace.”
Her advice to women entering the AI field is to always remember that being a woman can be an advantage. “It’s given you a perspective that’s different from your male peers and breakthroughs in technology always come from unique perspectives.”
She says to seek opportunities with companies that have shown their commitment to diversity and that have leaders who have showcased their efforts to support women and minorities. “Judge a potential employer by the way they show up in the interview process, not by the statements or the reports they put on their website.”
Hummon said that users should know that AI is not something that can solve all problems but rather is an expert assistant to enhance operations, improve effectiveness, and help support.
“Recognizing its limitations and ensuring there are proper checkpoints is key,” she said.
She said it’s always important to understand how generative AI was trained and built in order to understand any potential biases it could have. “This knowledge is a powerful tool when working with language models for data analysis and evaluating the feasibility of solutions,” she continued. “AI is only as good as the data and information it was trained on.”
She also gave some tips on how to build safe AI, explaining that Utilidata made an early decision to keep all of its data local. “Approaching model building using distributed AI computing reduces the amount and frequency of information being transmitted to the cloud and therefore reduces the chances of a security or privacy breach.”
As for investors, she said — like all of the experts we spoke to — they need to evaluate how a company wants to use AI, especially since responsible AI looks different in every industry. “The investment in responsible AI should be commensurate with the risk and complexity of any given company, not an across-the-board standard.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/20/lyft-is-working-on-a-service-animal-opt-in-feature-for-passengers/,Lyft is working on a ‘service animal opt-in feature’ for passengers | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-10-20,"Uber and Lyft need to do more to support disabled passengers, especially those who are blind or visually impaired, according to protesters who gathered outside the companies’ headquarters on October 15.
Wired spoke to protesters who shared stories about drivers passing them by or refusing to let them bring their guide dogs on a ride. They said ride-hailing companies should do more to educate drivers on accommodating passengers with visual impairments, and should exercise a “zero-tolerance” policy for discriminatory drivers.
A Lyft spokesperson said, “We strive to provide an inclusive and accessible platform for riders, including those who rely on service animals.” They said the company is “working directly with advocacy organizations in the community” and also pointed to an upcoming “service animal opt-in feature” that should launch by 2025.
The company mentioned the feature earlier this month in a profile of a new product manager, Shreya Shankar, who said this will allow riders to “declare that they have a service animal” (they’ll only need to do this once), so the driver will be notified before pickup.
“That way there shouldn’t be any surprises — or confusion or frustration from getting stranded,” Shankar said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/20/can-ai-sandbag-safety-checks-to-sabotage-users-yes-but-not-very-well-for-now/,"Can AI sandbag safety checks to sabotage users? Yes, but not very well — for now | TechCrunch",Devin Coldewey,2024-10-20,"AI companies claim to have robust safety checks in place that ensure that models don’t say or do weird, illegal, or unsafe stuff. But what if the models were capable of evading those checks and, for some reason, trying to sabotage or mislead users? Turns out they can do this, according to Anthropic researchers. Just not very well … for now, anyway.
“As AIs become more capable,” writes Anthropic’s Alignment Science team, “a new kind of risk might emerge: models with the ability to mislead their users, or subvert the systems we put in place to oversee them.”
Therefore we should look into ways of gauging “a model’s capacity for sabotage.”
The series of experiments they devised are fairly artificial and surface-level, but they do indicate that there’s something worth investigating further. Here are the shady models they trained and the outcomes they observed:
Task 1: Secretly mislead the user by misrepresenting data it is meant to summarize or interpret. Outcome: It works! The more aggressive the model’s attempts, the bigger effect it had on people using it, but it also made them more suspicious.
Task 2: Slip a bug into code that a human or other code checker model won’t notice. Outcome: It works! But only like 1% of the time when the checker is a state-of-the-art model.
Task 3: “Sandbag” a safety check by pretending to be less dangerous. Outcome: It works! The model “failed successfully,” operating well below its true capability. Fortunately, a standard “safety training” course that guides models to accurately represent its abilities restored the model to full potential (i.e., it was no longer able to hide dangerous capabilities).
Task 4: Deliberately don’t flag bad behavior by a model being monitored. Outcome: There was an attempt. The “overseer” AI, instructed to avoid flagging illegal or unsafe choices by other models, was itself quickly caught by another, more honest overseer AI. But what if that AI was compromised? Don’t worry, we can put another one on top of it. And then another just to be sure. It’s overseers all the way up.
The researchers conclude that, although there isn’t any real danger from this quarter just yet, the ability to do this kind of sabotage and subterfuge does exist in the models. That’s reason enough to keep an eye on it and include anti-sabotage methods in the safety stack.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/20/gustos-head-of-technology-says-hiring-an-army-of-specialists-is-the-wrong-approach-to-ai/,Gusto’s head of technology says hiring an army of specialists is the wrong approach to AI | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-10-20,"As founders plan for an increasingly AI-centric future, Gusto co-founder and head of technology Edward Kim said that cutting existing teams and hiring a bunch of specially trained AI engineers is “the wrong way to go.”
Instead, he argued that nontechnical team members can “actually have a much deeper understanding than an average engineer on what situations the customer can get themselves into, what they’re confused about,” putting them in a better position to guide the features that should be built into AI tools.
In an interview with TechCrunch, Kim — whose payroll startup generated more than $500 million in annual revenue in the fiscal year that ended in April 2023 — outlined Gusto’s approach to AI, with nontechnical members of its customer experience team writing “recipes” that guide the way its AI assistant Gus (announced last month) interacts with customers.
Kim also said that the company is seeing that “people who are not software engineers, but a little technically minded, are able to build really powerful and game-changing AI applications,” such as CoPilot — a customer experience tool that was rolled out to the Gusto CX team in June and is already seeing between 2,000 and 3,000 interactions per day.
“We can actually upskill a lot of our people here at Gusto to help them build AI applications,” Kim said.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Is Gus the first big AI product that you’ve released to your customers?
Gus is the big AI functionality that we launched to our customers, and in many ways ties together a lot of the point functionality that we’ve built. Because what you start to see happen in apps is they get littered with AI buttons that are, like, “Press this button to do something with AI.” Ours was, “Press this button so we can generate a job description for you.”
But Gus allows you to remove all of that, and when we feel Gus can do something that is of value to you, Gus can in an unobtrusive way pop up and say, “Hey, can I help you write a job description?” It’s a much cleaner way to interface with AI.
There are some companies that say they’ve been doing AI for a million years but didn’t get attention until now, and others that say they only realized the opportunity in the last couple years. Does Gusto fall in one camp or the other?
The big change for me is, when you talk about software programming, for most people, it’s not accessible. You have to learn how to code, go to school for many years. Machine learning was even more inaccessible. Because you have to be a very special type of software engineer and have this data science skill set and know how to create artificial neural networks and things like that.
The main thing that changed recently is that the interface to create ML and AI applications [has become] much more accessible to anybody. Whereas in the past, we’ve had to learn the language of computers and go to school for that; now computers are learning to understand humans more. And that seems like not that big of a deal, but if you think about it, it just makes building software applications so much more accessible.
That’s exactly what we’ve seen at Gusto: People who are not software engineers, but a little technically minded, are able to build really powerful and game-changing AI applications. We’re actually using a lot of our support team to extend the capabilities of Gus, and they don’t know how to program at all. It’s just that the interface that they use now allows them to do the same thing that software engineers have always done, without needing to learn how to code. If you want, I could talk through one example of each of those.
That’d be great.
There’s this one individual who’s been at the company for about five years. His name is Eric Rodriguez, and he actually joined the customer support team [and then] transferred into our IT team. While he was on that team, he started to get pretty interested in AI, and his boss came up to me and was like, “Hey, he built this thing. I want you to see it.” My first time meeting him in person, he showed me what he had built, which was essentially a CoPilot tool for our [customer experience] team, where you could ask it a question, and it will just give you the answer in natural language. Just like ChatGPT might, except it has access to our internal knowledge base of how to do things in our app.
At this point, we show this to our support team, and they loved it. It completely changed their workflows and how efficient they are. Basically, anytime they get a support ticket, instead of going through this knowledge base that we’ve built, they actually ask this CoPilot tool, and the CoPilot tool actually answers the question for them. There’s still a human in between the CoPilot and the customer, but a lot of times they’re able to just get the response from the CoPilot tool and then copy paste it to the customer. They verify that it’s accurate, which most of the time it is.
We immediately transferred [Eric] to the software engineering team. He actually reports directly to me, believe it or not, and he’s one of our best engineers now. Because he was one of the early adopters of just playing around with AI and now he’s on the forefront of building AI applications at Gusto.
Not everyone is technically minded like Eric, but we have found a way at Gusto to leverage the domain knowledge expertise of nontechnical folks in the company, especially in our customer support team, to help us build more powerful AI applications, and in particular, enable Gus to do more and more things.
Anytime the customer support team gets a support ticket — in other words, one of our customers reaches out to us because they want our support team’s help on something — and if it comes up repeatedly, we actually have the customer support team write a recipe for Gus, meaning that they can actually teach Gus without any technical ability. They can teach Gus to walk that customer through that problem, and sometimes even take action.
We’ve built an internal interface, an internal facing tool, where you can write instructions in natural language to Gus on how to handle a case like that. And there’s actually a no-code way for our support team to be able to tell Gus to call a certain API to accomplish a task.
There’s a lot of conversation out there right now that’s like, “We are going to eliminate all these jobs in this one area and we’re hiring these AI specialists that we’re paying millions of dollars because they have this unique skill set.” And I just think that’s the wrong way to go about doing it. Because the people who are going to be able to progress your AI applications are actually the ones that have the domain expertise of that area, even though they may not have the technical expertise. We can actually upskill a lot of our people here at Gusto to help them build AI applications.
The scary AI scenario is this top-down thing where executives are saying, “We need to use AI” and it’s disconnected from the reality of how people work. It sounds like this is more bottoms up, where you’ve built tools to allow teams to tell you what AI can do for them.
Exactly. In fact, the nontechnical folks that are closer to the customers, they talk to them every single day, they actually have a much deeper understanding than an average engineer on what situations the customer can get themselves into, what they’re confused about. So they are actually in a better position than engineers or AI scientists to write the instructions to Gus to solve that problem.
I think other people I’ve talked to have noticed the same thing. The best AI engineers are actually the people that are the domain experts that have learned how to write good prompts.
As you think about how this plays out over the next few years, do you think the company’s headcount across different teams is going to look pretty similar, or do you think that’ll change over time as AI is deployed across the company?
I think the role does evolve a little bit. I think you’ll see a lot of our CX folks not directly answering questions, but actually writing recipes and doing things like prompt tuning to improve the AI. Everyone’s going to just move up the abstraction layer, and then obviously it will bring more efficiencies to the company and also better customer experience, because they’ll get their questions answered immediately.
And that unlocks Gusto to do more things for our customers. There’s a huge roadmap of things that we want to be doing, but we can’t because we’re constrained in resources."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/20/investments-in-generative-ai-startups-topped-3-9b-in-q3-2024/,Investments in generative AI startups topped $3.9B in Q3 2024 | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-20,"Not everyone is convinced of generative AI’s return on investment. But many investors are, judging by the latest figures from funding tracker PitchBook.
In Q3 2024, VCs invested $3.9 billion in generative AI startups across 206 deals, per PitchBook. (That’s not counting OpenAI‘s $6.6 billion round.) And $2.9 billion of that funding went to U.S.-based companies across 127 deals.
Some of the biggest winners in Q3 were coding assistant Magic ($320 million in August), enterprise search provider Glean ($260 million in September), and business analytics firm Hebbia ($130 million in July). China’s Moonshot AI raised $300 million in August, and Sakana AI, a Japanese startup focused on scientific discovery, closed a $214 million tranche last month.
Generative AI, a broad cross-section of technologies that includes text and image generators, coding assistants, cybersecurity automation tools, and more, has its detractors. Experts question the tech’s reliability, and — in the case of generative AI models trained on copyrighted data without permission — its legality.
But VCs are effectively placing bets that generative AI will gain a foothold in large and profitable industries and that its long-tail growth won’t be impacted by the challenges it faces today.
Perhaps they’re right. A Forrester report predicts 60% of generative AI skeptics will embrace the tech — knowingly or not — for tasks from summarization to creative problem solving. That’s quite a bit rosier than Gartner’s prediction earlier in the year that 30% of generative AI projects will be abandoned after proof-of-concept by 2026.
“Large customers are rolling out production systems that take advantage of startup tooling and open source models,” Brendan Burke, senior analyst of emerging tech at PitchBook, told TechCrunch in an interview. “The latest wave of models shows that new generations of models are possible and may excel in scientific fields, data retrieval, and code execution.”
One formidable hurdle to widespread generative AI adoption is the technology’s massive computational requirements. Bain analysts project in a recent study that generative AI will drive companies to build gigawatt-scale data centers — data centers that consume 5 to 20 times the amount of power the average data center consumes today — stressing an already-strained labor and electricity supply chain.
Already, generative AI-driven demand for data center power is prolonging the life of coal-fired plants. Morgan Stanley estimates that, if this trend holds, global greenhouse emissions between now and 2030 could be three times higher versus if generative AI hadn’t been developed.
Several of the world’s largest data center operators, including Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Oracle, have announced investments in nuclear to offset their increasing nonrenewable energy draws. (In September, Microsoft said that it would tap power from the infamous Three Mile Island nuclear plant.) But it could take years before those investments bear fruit.
Investments in generative AI startups show no sign of decelerating — negative externalities be damned. ElevenLabs, the viral voice cloning tool, is reportedly seeking to raise funds at a $3 billion valuation, while Black Forest Labs, the company behind X’s notorious image generator, is said to be in talks for a $100 million funding round."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/20/joseph-jacks-bets-on-open-source-startups-a-paradox-of-philanthropy-and-capitalism/,"Joseph Jacks bets on open source startups, a 'paradox of philanthropy and capitalism' | TechCrunch",Paul Sawers,2024-10-20,"Open source might be many things, but one thing it’s not is a business model — by most estimations, at least. However, that hasn’t stopped Joseph Jacks and OSS Capital from seeking some of the earliest-stage, open source startups and funding them through their formative years.
These include the likes of open source Qualtrics-alternative Formbricks, which raised a pre-seed round of funding last year. Elsewhere, there is Notion alternative AppFlowy; Jira alternative Plane; Calendly alternative Cal.com; Postman alternative Hoppscotch; and for those seeking an alternative to Okta, Cerbos is worth a look. The one thing they all have in common is that they are open source, and they have all raised cash from OSS Capital. But they also highlight the perennial struggle between the open source and proprietary domains, showcasing two diametrically opposing ideas — that of giving something away for free and that of making a profit.
“The cool thing, though, about these open source companies is they are inherently philanthropic, while at the same time capitalistic and pursuing business models that actually generate sustainable revenue outcomes,” Jacks said in an interview with TechCrunch. “And I think they’re very paradoxical, from the very beginning all the way to when they’re large companies.”
This juxtaposition of “philanthropy” and “business” is at the heart of OSS Capital’s investment thesis, according to Jacks — he believes there should be more open source in the world, and his way of “expressing that belief” is one built around this idea of capitalism.
“I think capitalism can promote positive and sustainable behavior much better than philanthropy can for positive and sustainable behavior,” Jacks said. “I believe that capitalism itself is the penultimate manifestation of philanthropy, and commercial open source networks and startups are the most well-suited type of capitalism toward accelerating open source innovation in the world.”
Jacks founded one of the first commercial companies to spring up around Kubernetes, the containerized application platform spun out from Google in 2014. Kismatic, as Jacks’ startup was called, was acquired by enterprise software company Apprenda in 2016. Jacks also kickstarted the Kubernetes community conference KubeCon, which Kismatic donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2016.
After Kismatic, Jacks co-founded cloud data management startup Aljabr, and though this company ultimately went nowhere, it was around this time that Jacks started blogging about his thoughts on open source companies.
“The fund wasn’t a big grand plan — it was a process of being really obsessed with these open source companies, and I started a blog series that eventually led to starting the fund,” Jacks said. “I didn’t have any VC or investing experience.”
And so OSS Capital was born in 2018, with Jacks the solo general partner (GP) and investor. OSS Capital has now raised three funds, each around $50 million in size, with plans to close a fourth by early 2026.
While most of its investments are at the seed stage, OSS Capital does some follow-on funding, including leading on a Series A round last year into W4 Games, which is commercializing the open source game engine Godot. It has also done some larger checks for follow-on rounds, though for that it has used a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which involves setting up an entity for single investments.
There are also a few exits to speak of, including the full-stack web framework Remix, which Shopify acquired in mid-2022 and which is now the recommended way for users building Admin apps on Shopify.
“It was a small outcome for us — we made a few times our money, but it’s had great outcomes for Shopify,” Jacks said.
To date, OSS Capital has made in the region of 80 investments, and earlier this week, Jacks announced that he would be transitioning his firm from an ERA (exempt reporting adviser) to an RIA (registered investment adviser) to fulfill regulatory requirements around crypto. While Jacks stresses he isn’t “diversifying into crypto,” they have made a handful of investments in the space over the past few years, including $40 million in capital put into Parallel Studios, Bittensor, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s ResearchHub.
Today, OSS Capital counts a fairly extensive roster of limited partners (LPs) — mostly individuals, many of whom have connections to the world of open source software. These include Automattic CEO and WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg; Red Hat co-founder Bob Young; Cockroach Labs’ co-founder Spencer Kimball; and MongoDB co-founder Eliot Horowitz. Elsewhere, YouTube founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen are also backers, as are Shopify founder Tobias Lütke, GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner, and founding Google investor Ram Shriram.
OSS Capital also counts a handful of larger institutional investors, including Automattic, which has been its biggest corporate investor since OSS Capital’s second fund. Other notable names in the institution pot include Insight Partners and Summit Partners, both of which are renowned for their investments across the venture capital and private equity realms.
“I haven’t really pushed to get more of these institutional investors, or from the likes of nonprofits, foundations and endowments,” Jacks said. “I just haven’t spent time optimizing the design of the fund. The reason we have mostly individual investors is that they’re people that I really admire and I respect a lot — they understand what we’re doing, because they’ve built open source companies over the years.”
There are plenty of niche venture capital firms out there, focusing on everything from wildfires to oral health. Such vertical-specific investment philosophies might be an appealing proposition for early founders wanting deep industry expertise.
Didier Lopes, co-founder and CEO of OpenBB — often referred to as an open source alternative to Bloomberg Terminal — secured $8.5 million in a seed round of funding led by OSS Capital just six months after his project’s inception. And Lopes said that the insights and connections fostered through this initial tie-up opened doors.
“They recognized the time required to cultivate a strong and loyal community — their insights into how other startups navigate the balance between open source and commercial offerings was important for us to define our strategy going forward,” Lopes told TechCrunch. “But also, being able to connect us with open source leaders.”
This included introductions to angel investors, such as Red Hat’s Bob Young and AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant, in addition to executives from companies such as Elastic and GitLab who now sit on OpenBB’s advisory board.
However, leaning into “open source” as an investment ethos flies in the face of a growing sense that overly permissive software licensing just isn’t compatible with building a sustainable long-term business. By way of example, developer tooling unicorn Sentry, in cahoots with several other startups, is putting its weight behind a new licensing paradigm dubbed “fair source,” a tacit acknowledgment that while open source as a concept remains popular, startups are wary of its commercial limitations.
“Open source isn’t a business model — open source is a distribution model, it’s a software development model, primarily,” Chad Whitacre, Sentry’s head of open source, told TechCrunch in an interview last month. “And in fact, it places severe limits on what business models are available, because of the licensing terms.”
Jacks, for what it’s worth, is fully on board with this sentiment. “I agree with him completely, it’s true,” he said. This is surprising, given that his VC firm is seemingly all-in on open source. The three-letter acronym in “OSS Capital” stands for “open source software,” in case there were any lingering doubts.
But this is where we get into the real nitty-gritty of commercial open source software (COSS), which is often less about critical components of the software stack such as the wildly popular Kubernetes, and more about trying to monetize fully fledged SaaS apps that use open source as a carrot-on-a-stick. The go-to model for many of these businesses has come to be known as “open core,” where the core functionality of the software is open source, but a significant portion of the utility is locked behind a premium, proprietary paywall. This allows customers to tinker, inspect, integrate, and self-host — but if they want hosting or bells-and-whistles enterprise features, they have to pay.
And this is where Jacks is at pains to point out why “open source” in itself isn’t what he invests in.
“There’s a fundamental difference between ‘open source’ and ‘commercial open source’,” Jacks said. “Open source is a licensing paradigm, a technology development paradigm, a philosophy — that is not what I invest in; OSS Capital does not invest in open source. We manage money for people to multiply their investment, and make them tons more money. And I do what I do because I’m also very interested in making tons of money.”
Buried in amongst all this is a bet — a big bet — that “open core” will ultimately win out over pure proprietary.
“My view is that this kind of [open core] approach will actually replace closed core SaaS companies,” Jacks said. “I’ve had this thesis from the beginning of the fund, and it builds on what Marc Andreessen said about software eating the world, but my take on that has been that open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world.”
And he’s not the only person who thinks this. GitLab CEO and co-founder Sid Sijbrandij launched Open Core Ventures (OCV) in 2020, and while it’s slightly different in that it’s adopting more of an incubator approach to building and investing in companies around existing open source projects, it has a similar underlying philosophy. Sijbrandij believes that “open core” startups will represent 80% of venture-funded startups in the future, though he concedes it may “take a long time” before we actually reach that stage.
“The power of open core comes from giving users the ability to contribute — open core provides a level of trust, agility, and speed you can’t get with closed-source software,” Sijbrandij told TechCrunch. “We’re seeing the open core model mature and more entrepreneurs wanting to start businesses under the model — open core is a broad space between completely proprietary and completely open source. We think that over time most companies will be somewhere on this spectrum, instead of on the extremes.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/20/thrones-toilet-camera-takes-pictures-of-your-poop/,Throne’s toilet camera takes pictures of your poop | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-20,"Throne is an Austin-based health startup. It sells a camera. That clips onto the side of a toilet bowl. It takes pictures of your poop. Currently in beta, the system utilizes artificial intelligence to examine your dookie as a way of determining things like gut health and hydration.
Turns out we have a surprising amount to learn from our logs.
Throne calls its underlying technology “artificial gut intelligence.” That AI is “trained by physicians to help you understand what your waste is trying to tell you about your health,” per the company. The doctors are looking for various signs of health found in waste matter, including “nuances” in urine to determine hydration levels.
The company is quick to note that the images are “anonymized.” TechCrunch reached out to the company to get a better idea of what Throne is doing to address the inevitable security and privacy red flags that arise when discussing a toilet camera.
At TechCrunch’s behest, the firm on Friday posted a “privacy and security” page outlining some of those measures. At the top of that list, no doubt, are the joint questions of what, precisely, Throne is recording and how it uses those images. The camera is mercifully trained down at the bowl.
“We only capture images of the contents of your toilet bowl,” Throne writes. “Any other data is irrelevant to our mission and could compromise our ability to provide accurate health insights. We use image recognition technology to automatically delete any non-relevant images. This ensures that only toilet-related data is retained.”
Users can request full access to their data to see what manner of crap Throne is collecting. The company will also delete everything upon request. All data is encrypted by TLS 1.2 or higher on the company’s servers.
“We do not access an individual’s data,” Throne adds. “Our team only analyzes anonymized, aggregated data, which means the data can’t be traced back to the original user — to you!”
Few of us expect to get into the toilet camera business. That much can be said about Throne’s founders. CEO Scott Hickle tells TechCrunch that the startup began life as a marketplace for healthcare staffing, only to realize almost immediately that it had entered an already overcrowded field.
Shortly after raising an initial $1.2 million from investors, including Night Capital, Rief Ventures, and Hustle Fund, the company found itself at a crossroads.
“Within six weeks we came to the painful realization that the market was saturated and not a sandbox we wanted to play in,” says Hickle, “so we pivoted, and our investors were shockingly cool with us tackling consumer hardware.”
Throne didn’t just pivot. It pivoted to poop. The company is focused on both the aging population and those with chronic digestive conditions, including Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and IBS.
If that sounds like you — and you’re able to get past the idea of mounting a camera to your toilet — Throne’s system is up for preorder following a limited beta. The going price for a smart toilet camera is $499, though the company is making it available for $299 if you want to get in on it early."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/19/former-openai-cto-mira-murati-is-reportedly-fundraising-for-a-new-ai-startup/,Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati is reportedly fundraising for a new AI startup | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-10-19,"Mira Murati, the OpenAI CTO who announced her departure last month, is raising VC funding for a new AI startup, according to Reuters.
This startup will reportedly focus on building AI products based on proprietary models and could raise more than $100 million in this round.
When she left, Murati wrote on X that OpenAI had “fundamentally changed how AI systems learn and reason through complex problems” in its recent releases. She said, “I’m stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration,” but didn’t offer details about her plans.
Before joining OpenAI as VP of applied AI and partnerships in 2018, Murati worked at Tesla and Leap Motion. She was promoted to CTO in 2022 — and was even named interim CEO during co-founder and CEO Sam Altman’s brief ouster.
Murati is among several OpenAI executives to leave recently; OpenAI’s chief research officer and research VP announced their departures hours after she did. A week later, OpenAI said it had raised $6.6 billion in the largest VC round of all time."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/19/dji-sues-department-of-defense-over-listing-as-a-chinese-military-company/,DJI sues Department of Defense over listing as a Chinese military company | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-10-19,"Drone-maker DJI filed a lawsuit Friday against the U.S. Department of Defense over its inclusion on a DoD list of “Chinese military companies.”
A DJI spokesperson said the company filed the suit after “attempting to engage with the DoD for more than sixteen months” and deciding “it had no alternative other than to seek relief in federal court.”
“DJI is not owned or controlled by the Chinese military, and the DoD itself acknowledges that DJI makes consumer and commercial drones, not military drones,” the spokesperson said.
The Chinese company was added to the DoD’s list in 2022, following similar actions from other government agencies — in 2020, DJI was placed on the Department of Commerce’s Entity List that essentially blocked U.S. companies from selling to it, and it was placed on the Treasury Department’s investment blocklist the following year, due to DJI’s alleged involvement in the surveillance of Uyghur Muslims. (The company said it had “nothing to do with treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.”)
In its lawsuit, DJI says that as a result of the listing, it has “suffered ongoing financial and reputational harm, including lost business, and employees have been stigmatized and harassed.”
The company claims that the DoD report justifying the listing “contains a scattershot set of claims that are wholly inadequate to support DJI’s designation.”
The lawsuit argues, “Among numerous deficiencies, the Report applies the wrong legal standard, confuses individuals with common Chinese names, and relies on stale facts and attenuated connections that fall short of establishing that DJI is [a Chinese military company].” It also says that founder and CEO Frank Wang and three early-stage investors “together hold 99% of the company’s voting rights and approximately 87.4% of its shares.”
A Defense official told TechCrunch, “The Department of Defense does not provide information or statements regarding any pending litigation matters.”"

This week, we’re diving into the recent layoffs at Meta; the fallout from the battle between WordPress and WP Engine; and whether Cybertrucks are simply too big to exist in Europe. Let’s get into it.
Multiple teams at Meta were hit by layoffs this week. The company confirmed the layoffs in a statement to TechCrunch and noted that the changes were made to reallocate resources. The cuts reportedly impacted teams working on Reality Labs, Instagram, and WhatsApp, though Meta declined to comment on the record about how many employees were affected and what orgs they were part of.
AWS CEO Matt Garman has harsh words for remote workers: Return to the office or quit. The executive recently told employees who don’t like the new five-day in-person work policy that “there are other companies around.” Last month, Amazon’s CEO Andy Jassy told employees that there will be a full return-to-office starting in 2025, an increase from three days for roughly the last year.
Waymo gave software engineer Sophia Tung promo codes for free rides as an apology for the late-night honking she filmed over the summer that was caused by the self-driving cars. However, when Tung realized the codes weren’t capped in value, she attempted to use her last one to ride in a Waymo for 24 hours. Her plans were ultimately cut short — but she did last a good 6.5 hours.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/19/i-just-spent-my-first-week-ever-with-an-ev-the-chevy-equinox-heres-what-it-was-like/,"I just spent my first week ever with an EV, the Chevy Equinox — here's what it was like | TechCrunch",Matt Rosoff,2024-10-19,"The funnest car I ever drove was the original Tesla Roadster.
This was in 2011, back when Elon Musk’s EV company was courting press instead of denigrating us, and they offered me a test drive. I took the car up I-280 — a beautiful, mostly deserted highway with perfectly banked curves that seemed designed for Silicon Valley types to test out their speedmobiles — and was blown away by its responsive acceleration and the ease with which it handled at 120 miles per hour. (Er, did I say 120? I meant 70. Yeah.)
I’ve gone fast in a few other sports cars — an ’80s-era Nissan Z and Fiat Spider, and a ’90s-era Porsche 911 — but the Roadster’s essential electric-ness (no gears!) made for a unique driving experience, like an exceptionally overpowered and aerodynamic golf cart. I didn’t care much about the iPad-like controller on the dash or the door handles or any of the other bells and whistles. I just loved the way it drove.
I’m not an auto reporter like Kirsten, so my chances to drive new cars are few and far between. Since that Roadster experience, I’ve only briefly driven a couple other Teslas owned by friends and have never tried another EV. My own cars have been strictly gas burners.
So I was over-the-moon excited when GM offered me a chance to live with an EV, the new Chevy Equinox, for a full week ahead of my onstage interview with CEO Mary Barra at TechCrunch Disrupt on October 29.
They dropped it at my house in San Francisco on Monday. It’s quite beautiful, as you can see in the photo above.
The first thing I wondered: How will I plug it in? This has been one of the biggest mental barriers that’s stopped me from going electric, and I’m still not sure what the answer is. I gather you need some kind of home adapter, and then you ideally need to upgrade the voltage to 220V so it can charge more overnight. To me, that sounds like an expensive call to an electrician.
Since I was driving the Equinox for only a week, I figured I could get enough charge at one of the Shell charging stations outside the mall where I hit the gym every morning.
It had about 300 miles of range when it was delivered, so there was no need to worry about that right away.
My son was off school on Monday so I took him down the block for a burrito. Like most modern cars, the Equinox unlocks automatically when you approach it with the key. Unlike most other cars I’ve driven, though, it actually starts without your having to press any buttons or do anything — you just sit in the seat and it’s on.
GM has really embraced the “computer on wheels” aspect of modern vehicles, putting nearly every relevant control into a wide touchscreen mounted on the dash.
Connecting my phone to Bluetooth was a little puzzling, until I noticed the “on” button on the upper edge of the touch screen — the screen lit up for some basic controls, but to get full functionality, you have to touch the button. (The car turns on automatically when you sit down but the touchscreen doesn’t? Odd design choice.)
By and large, the control system was easy and fun to use. I loved the built-in Google Maps, which is way more useful and intuitive than the mapping system built into my Toyota. But I could not connect Apple’s CarPlay system wirelessly, to use, say, Apple Maps. That’s apparently by design. It’s Google or the highway, friends.
Other quirks: If there’s a physical headlight button, I couldn’t find it, which meant I had to use the screen to turn the headlights off when I parked the car. (The default headlight setting is “auto,” so they would’ve flipped off eventually, but I’m old-school and have been mentally trained to turn the lights off so I don’t run the battery down.) Also, when you turn the car off, you have to manually touch another control on the screen. It’s easy enough to get used to — but if you accidentally tap the brake with your foot as you get out of the car, it turns back on and you have to manually shut it down from the screen again.
On the plus side, there’s this exceptionally cool anti-crash system that vibrates the driver’s seat on the side that corresponds with where nearby objects are. The vibrations grow stronger as you get closer. It might sound annoying, but I found it intuitive and natural, almost like it taps into the same part of the human brain that helps you avoid people when walking down a city street. It was less irritating than the triple-beeps my Toyota sounds every time I’m about to hit something.
As far as the driving goes, it’s got great power. I was able to quickly climb a very steep hill by my house that normally requires a gas car’s “Sport” mode to burn up. The freeway acceleration was instant and reminded me again of that Tesla — there’s just something about the way a (good) EV revs up without changing gears that feels responsive and smooth. The suspension was a bit tighter than I like, the steering a bit looser, but that’s just a personal preference. (And no, I did not drive this car anywhere close to 120 mph, but it felt like I could’ve!)
Then came Tuesday morning. Charging time.
It wasn’t as simple as I’d hoped. First, I had to find the port, which is on the upper side of the front left fender above the wheel. Then I had to scan a QR code, download the Shell app, connect it to my Apple Pay account, plug it in, and wait for confirmation. It made a sweet little beep when it was charging, and a blue light on the dash turned green.
Nowhere near the ease of a gas station where you just show up, pump, and pay. The price was a lot better, though — it cost $0, all week. I figure if those rates held, I’d save about $1,500 on gas per year. (We don’t drive much, living in a compact city with mostly decent public transit.)
My charging routine worked well until Friday morning. All the charging stations near the gym were occupied, so I drove farther down the mall parking lot, pulled up to an empty one, scanned the QR code, and … nothing. The Shell app couldn’t find the charger and instead kept directing me back to the other stations, which it listed as “unoccupied” even though the stalls were full.
I got on a call with support — at 5:30 in the morning, in a mall parking lot, which nobody wants to do — and they couldn’t figure it out either. But I was told if I created an account, they might be able to charge it for me remotely. (No thanks. I needed to get to the gym and get my day started.) I finally found a charging station about a 7-minute walk from the gym entrance that was both unoccupied and properly listed in the app.
This isn’t a knock against GM. But relying on partners for such a critical function — especially for novice EV users nervous about charging, as I was — is a risky strategy and reinforces how Tesla’s decision to build its own Supercharger network was an expensive but necessary investment. Perhaps it’s good that the Equinox has an adapter that lets you use Tesla’s network.
Tesla’s core business has always been EVs, and it never had a fallback strategy. It had to make the EV experience better than any gas car in order to survive. GM is embracing the future with EVs, and self-driving systems, and groundbreaking software. But it still builds millions of gas cars each year and has to play all sides of the market.
One final side note, which will sound weird to auto enthusiasts or people who review cars for a living but which I think may be more typical of the average car buyer’s experience: I don’t really want to spend much time learning how to use a car.
The point of a car is to get where you need to go quickly and efficiently, preferably with some fun on the way. As the industry has aggressively embraced the “computer on wheels” concept pioneered by Tesla, I’d argue that they’ve made cars a little too complicated. Do we really need new ways to shift from park to drive? Do we really need to learn a new control scheme for every brand of car we drive? I may be exhibiting some “old man yells at cloud” mentality, but sometimes I just want to drive down the coast and feel the freedom of the road.
The Equinox showed me GM is a credible player in the market, and worth considering when I’m ready to take the plunge. But it also convinced me I’m still not ready for an EV."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/19/four-takeaways-from-pony-ais-ipo-filing/,Four takeaways from Pony AI's IPO filing | TechCrunch,"Rebecca Bellan, Sean O'Kane",2024-10-19,"Toyota-backed autonomous vehicle company Pony AI has joined the list of Chinese firms going public on the U.S. stock market after a multi-year ban from Beijing on offshore capital raising.
Zeekr, a luxury Chinese electric vehicle startup, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in May, and WeRide, another AV startup, also hopes to file an IPO in the U.S. this year at a $5 billion valuation, but its plans have been delayed as of August.
Pony was valued at $8.5 billion when it raised capital in 2022. Toyota participated in that round as a follow-on investor after injecting the startup with $400 million in 2020, per PitchBook data. The Japanese automaker’s stake in Pony is at 13.4%. The Chinese AV startup has since secured $100 million from Saudi Arabia’s Neom in 2023 and $27 million from Chinese VC GAC Capital in October.
But the filing to go public reveals that Pony’s board of directors recently slashed the minimum valuation for its IPO down to $4 billion. Pony also dropped its minimum target for what it wants to raise in the transaction from $425 million to just $200 million.
That’s not all that stood out in Pony’s IPO filing, though, so here are our top four takeaways.
IPO filings are chock-full of numbers that were either previously obscure or lacking context, and Pony’s is no exception.
The company says it operates a fleet of 190 “robotrucks” in Beijing and Guangzhou, and over 250 robotaxis in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai. It can charge for robotaxi fares in all four cities and is fully driverless in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.
On the robotaxi side, Pony says it receives an average of 15 daily orders per robotaxi from the 220,000 registered users on the PonyPilot app. Overall it says it has accumulated more than 20 million “autonomous driving miles,” though just 2.4 million of those had no human driver behind the wheel.
Pony complements its robotaxi service with a growing robotruck business. It says it has already acquired 57 corporate customers — accounting for 73% of total revenue in the first half of this year. But the majority of that money is coming from Pony’s top three customers, who generated 62.8% of total revenues during the same period.
It’s no secret that autonomous vehicles are a pricey business. And while Pony says it generated gross profits of $32 million and $17 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively, the company lost more than $270 million over those years.
A huge driver of those losses has been Pony’s R&D spend. Understandable, given that Pony is a company developing pioneer technology, involving an extremely sensor-heavy autonomous stack. But we wonder when Pony is going to really prioritize operations over R&D. As of June 30, the startup’s workforce of around 1,300 employees is 44% R&D, 16% technology deployment and production, and only 28.5% operations. It spent $73 million on R&D employee salaries alone in 2023 and finished the first half of this year with $335 million in cash.
Pony projects it will bring in a lot more money in the coming years, especially as robotaxi fares increase. But it sounds less optimistic about bringing the costs down, because in the filing it does not say it expects the cost of that revenue to decrease over time — only that those costs will “continue to evolve in the near future.”
Now, Pony’s revenue did nearly double to $24.7 million in the first half of 2024 when compared to the same period last year. It has also pared its losses year-over-year in the first half. But while it looks like Pony’s revenue is going up and to the right if we look only at the first half of the year, the company still has a long way to go if it hopes to beat 2023’s total revenue of $71.9 million.
Every company needs to lay out the risks associated with the business when they go public. But damn it all if Pony wasn’t incredibly thorough with 60 pages’ worth of disclaimers.
One of its main risks? It’s coming off a shortage of sufficiently skilled staff with knowledge of U.S. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) to ensure proper compliance with SEC requirements.
While Pony says it has fixed this weakness as of the end of 2023, there is very recent evidence that shows how real a risk this can be to a young business — Fisker. That EV startup’s nosedive into bankruptcy was, in large part, triggered by it missing the deadline to file its third-quarter financial results last year.
There’s also the old People’s Republic of China conundrum — something Zeekr is familiar with. We’ll let Pony say it: “The PRC regulatory authorities have significant oversight over our business and may influence our operations as they deem appropriate to further economic, regulatory, political and societal goals.”
Moving on, Pony included a slight risk of not being able to continue its extremely limited robotaxi testing in the U.S. due to impending regulations against Chinese connected vehicles. The startup has a permit to test AVs with a driver behind the wheel in California, but it says its operations in the U.S. generated “less than 1% of our total revenues in 2023 and the six months ended June 30, 2024.”
We are now a few years removed from the special purpose acquisition merger craze that allowed startups to make outrageous projections about their businesses. Remember when Faraday Future projected it would sell more than 100,000 EVs in 2024? It’s sold roughly 13 to date.
This is a traditional IPO, so Pony doesn’t have nearly as much license to be so unhinged with its projections. Still, Pony indulges in some self-flattering imagery of what its technology is capable of that we’d be remiss not to share with you.
“On the public roads of China’s metropolises, Pony has achieved what was once only depicted in science fiction — building a car that drives itself,” the company writes. “Passengers, wide-eyed with wonder, unlock the door using the app and climb into the back seat.”
“Stepping out of the car, the passengers pay the fare through the app and conclude this awe-inspiring ride. Meanwhile, the robotaxi drives itself away to pick up the next passenger, leaving one to ponder what other marvels the future holds.”
Wide-eyed, indeed.
Correction: A previous version of this article did not accurately represent the cities in which Pony AI offers fully driverless and commercial ridehail services in China."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/19/penguin-random-house-is-adding-an-ai-warning-to-its-books-copyright-pages/,Penguin Random House is adding an AI warning to its books' copyright pages | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-10-19,"Penguin Random House, the trade publisher, is adding language to the copyright pages of its books to prohibit the use of those books to train AI.
The Bookseller reports that new books and reprints of older titles from the publisher will now include the statement, “No part of this book may be used or reproduced in any manner for the purpose of training artificial intelligence technologies or systems.”
While the use of copyrighted material to train AI models is currently being fought over in multiple lawsuits, Penguin Random House appears to be the first major publisher to update its copyright pages to reflect these new concerns.
The update doesn’t mean Penguin Random House is completely opposed to the use of AI in book publishing. In August, it outlined an initial approach to generative AI, saying it will “vigorously defend the intellectual property that belongs to our authors and artists” while also promising to “use generative AI tools selectively and responsibly, where we see a clear case that they can advance our goals.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/19/midjourney-plans-to-let-anyone-on-the-web-edit-images-with-ai/,Midjourney plans to let anyone on the web edit images with AI | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-19,"Midjourney is planning to release an upgraded web tool that’ll let users edit any uploaded images from the web using Midjourney’s generative AI.
The upgraded tool, which Midjourney CEO David Holz said will be released “early next week,” will also allow users to retexture objects in images to “repaint” their colors and details according to captions.
Editing existing images with AI has become a hot-button topic lately. Platforms like Meta have wrestled with how to label images edited with AI tools versus generated from scratch with an AI model, while companies like Google have released powerful AI features that give no visual indication that images have been AI-modified.
Last year, Midjourney committed to using the IPTC’s Digital Source Type property, a technical standard that embeds metadata in images denoting that they’ve been AI-generated. However, the company is one of the few major AI platforms that hasn’t embraced C2PA, a metadata technology that traces an image’s full provenance, including the equipment and software used to create it.
In a post on Midjourney’s official Discord server, Holz said that the upgraded image tool will be restricted to a “subset of the current community” to start, with increased human moderation as well as “new, more advanced AI moderators” to attempt to prevent abuse.
“Honestly, we’re not sure how to precisely restrict deployment of this feature,” he said. Midjourney is soliciting community feedback via a poll that it’ll use to determine which users get access first.
There are risks to releasing these types of editing tools without adequate safeguards in place. They could facilitate copyright infringement on a massive scale or promote the spread of misleading deepfakes.
Deepfakes are spreading like wildfire across social media and making it harder to distinguish truth from disinformation. Most recently, fake generative AI images of destruction and human suffering flooded the web in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
According to data from Clarity, a deepfake detection firm, 900% more deepfakes have been created and published this year compared to the same time frame last year. It’s causing alarm, understandably. A recent poll from YouGov found that 85% of Americans were concerned about misleading deepfakes spreading online.
In the absence of a law criminalizing deepfakes at the federal level in the U.S., more than 10 states have enacted statutes against AI-aided impersonation. California’s law — currently stalled — would be the first to empower judges to order the posters of deepfakes to take them down or potentially face monetary penalties.
Midjourney hasn’t exactly been a shining example of responsible AI deployment. (It’s being sued over its alleged use of copyrighted content to train its generative AI models, for example.) But in recent months, the platform has taken steps to limit the spread of deepfakes, including filters for political figures leading up to the U.S. presidential election.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/19/women-in-ai-dr-rebecca-portnoff-is-protecting-children-from-harmful-deepfakes/,Women in AI: Dr. Rebecca Portnoff is protecting children from harmful deepfakes | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-10-19,"As a part of TechCrunch’s ongoing Women in AI series, which seeks to give AI-focused women academics and others their well-deserved — and overdue — time in the spotlight, TechCrunch interviewed Dr. Rebecca Portnoff, who is vice president of data science at the nonprofit Thorn, which builds tech to protect children from sexual abuse.
She attended Princeton University before receiving her PhD in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley. She has been working her way up the ladder at Thorn, where she has worked since 2016. She started as a volunteer research scientist and now, eight years later, leads a team that is probably one of the only in the world dedicated to building machine learning and artificial intelligence to stop, prevent, and defend children from sexual abuse.
“During my senior year at Princeton, as I was contemplating what to do after graduation, my sister recommended I read ‘Half the Sky’ by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, which introduced me to the topic of child sexual abuse,” she told TechCrunch, saying the book inspired her to study how to make a difference in this space. She went on to write her doctorate dissertation focusing especially on using machine learning and AI in this space.
At Thorn, Portnoff’s team helps to identify victims, stop revictimization, and prevent the viral spread of sexual abuse material. She led the Thorn and All Tech Is Human’s joint Safety by Design initiative last year, which strives to prevent people from using generative AI to sexually harm children.
“It was a tremendous lift, collaboratively defining principles and mitigations to prevent generative models from producing abuse material, make such material more reliably detected, and prevent the distribution of those models, services, and apps that are used to produce this abuse material, then aligning industry leaders to commit to those standards,” she recalled. She said she met many people dedicated to the cause, “but I’ve also got more gray hair than I did at the start of it all.”
Using AI to create nonconsensual sexual images has become a big discussion, especially as AI porn generations become more sophisticated, as TechCrunch previously reported. There is currently no comprehensive federal law in place that protects or prevents sexual generative AI images created of other people without their consent, though individual states, like Florida, Louisiana, and New Mexico, have passed their own legislation to specifically target AI child abuse.
In fact, she said this is one of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves. “One in 10 minors report they knew of cases where their peers had generated nude imagery of other kids,” she said.
“We don’t have to live in this reality and it’s unacceptable that we’ve allowed it to go to this point already.” She said there are mitigations, however, that can be put in place to prevent and reduce this misuse. Thorn, for example, is advocating that tech companies adopt their safety-by-design principles and mitigations, and publicly share how they are preventing the misuse of their generative AI technologies and products in furthering child sexual abuse, collaborating with professional organizations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to support setting standards for companies that can be used to audit progress, as well as engaging with policymakers to inform them of how important this is.
“Legislation grounded in impact will be necessary to bring all companies and stakeholders on board,” she said.
As she rose through the ranks in building AI, Portnoff recalls people ignoring her advice, asking instead to speak with someone who has a technical background. “My response? ‘No worries, you are talking with someone with a technical background,’” she said.
She said a few things have helped her navigate working in such a male-dominated field: being prepared, acting with confidence, and assuming good intentions. Being prepared helps her enter rooms with more confidence, while confidence allows her to navigate challenges with curiosity and boldness, “seeking first to understand and then to be understood,” she continued.
“Assuming good intent helps me approach challenges with kindness rather than defensiveness,” she said. “If that good intent truly isn’t there, it’ll show eventually.”
Her advice to women seeking to enter AI is to always believe in your ability and meaning. She said it’s easy to fall into the trap of letting the assumptions people have about you define your potential, but that everyone’s voice is going to be needed in this current AI revolution.
“As ML/AI becomes more integrated into our human systems, all of us need to work together to ensure it’s done in a way that builds up our collective flourishing and prioritizes the most vulnerable among us.”
Portnoff said there are many facets to responsible AI, including the need for transparency, fairness, reliability, and safety. “But all of them have one thing in common,” she continued. “Responsibly building ML/AI requires engaging with more stakeholders than just your fellow technologists.”
This means more active listening and collaboration. “If you’re following a roadmap for building responsible AI, and you find that you haven’t talked to anyone outside your organization or your engineering team in the process, you’re probably headed in the wrong direction.”
And, as investors continue to dump billions of dollars into AI startups, Portnoff suggested that investors can start looking at responsibility as early as the due diligence stage, looking at a company’s commitment to ethics before making an investment, and then requiring certain standards to be met. This can “prevent harm and enable positive growth.”
“There is a lot of work that needs to be done,” she said, talking generally. “And you can be the one to make it happen.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/19/23andme-faces-an-uncertain-future-so-does-your-genetic-data/,23andMe faces an uncertain future — so does your genetic data  | TechCrunch,Carly Page,2024-10-19,"DNA and genetic testing firm 23andMe is in turmoil following a data breach last year and its ongoing financial decline. The once-pioneering giant now faces an uncertain future amid efforts to take the company private, intensifying concerns about what might happen to the genetic data of 23andMe’s some 15 million customers.
Best known for its saliva-based test kits that offer a glimpse into a person’s genetic ancestry, 23andMe has seen its value plummet more than 99% from its $6 billion peak since going public in early 2021 after failing to turn a profit.
That lack of profit was attributed to waning consumer interest in 23andMe’s use-once test kits and lackluster growth of its subscription services. The company was also floored by a huge months-long data breach that saw hackers steal the ancestry data of almost 7 million users throughout 2023. The company agreed in September to pay $30 million to settle a lawsuit related to the breach.
Less than a week later, 23andMe founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki said she was “considering third-party takeover proposals” for the company. Wojcicki quickly walked back the statement, instead saying she planned to take the company private. But the damage was done, and all of the company’s independent board members resigned with immediate effect.
Where does that leave millions of people’s genetic data?
As evidenced by last year’s data breach, which saw hackers steal information such as users’ genetic predisposition and ancestry reports, 23andMe collects a ton of information on its users.
If you’re one of the many millions that have shipped your saliva to 23andMe to learn about your ancestry, you may have assumed that this data will remain private under law, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. HIPAA, as it’s known, sets the standards for protecting sensitive health information from being disclosed without a person’s knowledge or consent.
However, 23andMe is not a company covered under HIPAA. As such, 23andMe is largely bound only by its own privacy policies, which it can change at any time.
Andy Kill, a spokesperson for 23andMe, told TechCrunch that the company believes this is a “more appropriate and transparent model for the data we handle, rather than the HIPAA model employed by the traditional healthcare industry.”
A lack of federal regulation and a cluttered mess of state privacy laws ultimately means that if 23andMe faces a sale, the data of millions of Americans is also on the table. The company’s privacy policy says that its customers’ personal information “may be accessed, sold or transferred” as part of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale.
The fact that customer data is a saleable asset has also been made clear by Wojcicki, who reportedly told investors that 23andMe will no longer pursue its cost-intensive drug development programs and will instead focus on marketing its vast database of customer data to pharmaceutical companies and researchers.
23andMe maintains that its data privacy policies would not change in the event of a sale. These policies state that the company will never share users’ information with insurance companies, or with law enforcement without a warrant. The latter have increasingly turned to third-party DNA companies for genetic information, but 23andMe has so far resisted all U.S. law enforcement requests for such data, according to its long-running transparency report.
Potential buyers of 23andMe may have entirely different ideas about how to use the company’s potentially valuable trove of DNA data. Privacy advocates at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation have already urged 23andMe to resist a sale to any company with ties to law enforcement, warning that customers’ genetics data could be used by police to indiscriminately search for evidence of crimes.
“Our own commitment to apply the terms of our privacy policy to the personal information of our customers in the event of a sale or transfer is clear: the 23andMe Terms of Service and Privacy Statement would remain in place unless and until customers are presented with, and agree to, new terms and statements — and only after receiving appropriate notice of any new terms, under applicable data protection laws,” Kill told TechCrunch.
While 23andMe appears to be resisting a sale to a third-party company for now, Wojcicki’s recanted comments have already sounded alarm bells among privacy advocates, who are urging 23andMe customers to take action now to protect their data from being sold by requesting that 23andMe deletes their data.
Meredith Whittaker, the president of end-to-end encrypted messaging app Signal, said in a post on X: “It’s not just you. If anyone in your family gave their DNA to [23andMe], for all of your sakes, close your/their account now.”
Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the EFF, also warned users to take action. “If you have a 23andMe account, today is a good day to login and request the deletion of your data,” said Galperin in a post on X.
Requesting the deletion of your data on 23andMe is relatively easy.
Log in to your 23andMe account and navigate to Settings > Account Information > Delete Your Account. 23andMe will prompt you to confirm your decision, warning that deleting your account is permanent and irreversible.
There is an important caveat. As noted in 23andMe’s privacy policy, account deletion is “subject to retention requirements and certain exceptions,” which means the company may hold on to some of your data for an unspecified amount of time.
For example, 23andMe will retain your genetic information, date of birth, and gender “as required for compliance” and will retain limited data related to your deletion request, “including but not limited to, your email address, account deletion request identifier, communications related to inquiries or complaints and legal agreements.”
Similarly, if you’ve already agreed to 23andMe sharing your data for research purposes, you can reverse that consent, but there’s no way for you to delete that information. Kill tells TechCrunch that around 80% of 23andMe customers — roughly 12 million people — consent to participate in its research program."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/spacex-wins-733m-space-force-launch-contract/,SpaceX wins $733M Space Force launch contract | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-18,"SpaceX was awarded an eight-launch, $733 million contract by the U.S. Space Force on Friday, as part of an ongoing program intended to foster competition among launch providers.
The award includes seven launches for the Space Development Agency and one for the National Reconnaissance Office, all anticipated to use Falcon 9s and occur no earlier than 2026.
The massive new contract is part of a U.S. Space Force Space Systems Command (SSC) program with the catchy name of “National Security Space Launch Phase 3 Lane 1.” This third round of contracts was split into two lanes last year: Lane 1, for lower-risk missions and near-Earth orbits; and Lane 2, for heavy-lift missions and the more demanding orbits.
The Space Force selected SpaceX, United Launch Alliance and (somehow, despite not getting to orbit yet) Blue Origin to compete for launches under Lane 1 earlier this summer. At the time, the Space Force acknowledged that the pool of awardees was small, but that it aimed to account for this by allowing companies to bid on Lane 1 on an annual basis. The next opportunity to join Lane 1, which has a total expected value of $5.6 billion over five years, will be later in 2024.
In a press release announcing the contract, Lt. Col. Douglas Downs, SSC’s materiel leader for space launch procurement, said the force expects to see “increasing competition and diversity” with the ability to on-ramp new providers.
The Phase 3 Lane 1 award period is from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2029, with the potential for a five-year extension. The Space Force anticipates awarding at least 30 missions over that period. The SpaceX win may seem like a foregone conclusion this time, but with new launch companies and vehicles coming online in the next few years, the competition may heat up soon."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/eric-schmidts-sandboxaq-aims-for-5b-valuation-for-its-ai-quantum-google-moonshot/,Eric Schmidt's SandboxAQ aims for $5B valuation for its AI/quantum Google moonshot | TechCrunch,Julie Bort,2024-10-18,"VCs are spending gobs of money on AI startups — especially those run by big names in tech — so SandboxAQ is putting its hand out again, even though it raised a whopping $500 million in early 2023.
The spinout from Google parent company Alphabet is reportedly seeking to raise another round that would value it at $5 billion, sources tell Bloomberg. Its last $500 million round, completed in February 2023, had backers like Breyer Capital, T. Rowe Price funds, and Marc Benioff, Reuters reported at the time. PitchBook estimated its valuation after that round to be $4 billion.
SandboxAQ began as Alphabet’s moonshot AI quantum computing unit led by Jack Hidary, also known as a longtime X Prize board member. It was spun out of Alphabet into an independent startup in March 2022, with Hidary as CEO. Billionaire and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt became the startup’s chairman.
Its mission is a veritable alphabet soup of buzzwords: to work at the intersection of quantum computing and AI. But it is not building a quantum computer, although its software products should one day work with them, Hidary said on a recent episode of the Peter H. Diamandis podcast. Instead, it’s building software based on quantum physics that can model molecules and make predictions of their behavior. Google is still working on the quantum computer part, but Hidary says SandboxAQ already has a number of quantum computing partnerships.
The startup has its hands in a large and somewhat wild assortment of products across life science, materials science, navigation, encryption, and cybersecurity.
It is not working with AI of the generative AI ChatGPT chatbot variety. Instead of predicting language, it is using large modeling AI techniques on equations. Or as Hidary explained, “Instead of the world of large language models, we’ve now entered the world of large quantitative models, LQMs. And LQMs are about starting with equations to generate data. …That’s the most efficient way to generate data, and the most accurate way to generate data.”
To that end, it already has a list of impressive developmental contracts. For instance, it is working on how to extend lithium-ion battery life with battery company Novonix; it has a contract with the U.S. Air Force to develop magnetic navigation systems that don’t rely on GPS; and it’s working with a number of U.S. hospitals on an AI-powered “magnetocardiography system,” a new kind of medical device for imaging the heart, among other projects.
So, this AI is swinging for bigger fences than writing term papers or creating deepfake videos.
Interestingly, there are some indicators that SandboxAQ could become one of the AI companies that VCs are eager to back. Throughout the year, a number of investors have set up special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for the company’s shares. As we previously reported, such SPVs have become a hot financial tool because so many investors are eager to get a piece of big-name AI startups.
SandboxAQ did not immediately respond to our request for comment."

If so, the new Buzz Lightyear robot might be for you.
A collaboration between Pixar and smart toy company Robosen, the new Buzz is fully loaded with more than 3,000 tiny parts, 75 microchips, and 23 servo motors. It also features what Robosen calls “first of its kind micro-servos,” which is what helps Buzz make those intricate eye and mouth movements.
You can activate the robot using voice commands or by pressing one of the multicolor buttons on his chest, but he really comes to life with the app, which unlocks a number of different features. There are preset actions based on scenes from the Toy Story movies, along with a remote control feature that’s a bit finicky without an extremely flat surface.

The bankruptcy filing in a Delaware court comes as the company’s losses mount and it faces several lawsuits, including a class action filed on October 10 in Colorado, after it allegedly failed to pay money owed to members of its Fluid Vehicle Investor Program (FVIP) — a program that allowed individuals, including employees, and small business owners to purchase fleets of vans and trucks to be rented out on the platform under Fluid’s management.
Fluid Truck has estimated that the number of creditors awaiting payment is at around 5,500. The company owes FVIP members $12 million, and owes vendors $26 million. That’s on top of the $20.6 million in cash losses Fluid Truck suffered in 2023.
James Eberhard and Jenifer Snyder, Fluid Truck’s sibling co-founders and former CEO and chief legal counsel, respectively, founded the startup, which has been referred to as the Zipcar of commercial vehicles, in 2016. Since then, Fluid Truck has managed to raise more than $80 million in venture funds and expand to 400 cities in 32 states across the U.S. But the company soon found itself in a deep financial hole under the stewardship of Eberhard due to a combination of macroeconomic factors and mismanaged insurance claims.
Fluid’s deficits accumulated and bad blood started festering between Eberhard and two minority shareholders on the board — Bison Capital and Ingka Investments — according to people familiar with the matter. Eberhard was unable to raise more capital to fund the company’s losses, and in July, the board voted to remove him and Snyder from their roles.
Eberhard’s replacement, Scott Avila from Paladin Management, began exploring liquidation options in August, according to a declaration he filed in bankruptcy court on October 16.
But then Fluid Truck received a large, long-awaited payment from a customer, and decided to use that momentum to try to sell the company. That’s when Kingbee Rentals, a van rental agency in West Valley City, Utah, came forward unexpectedly as a potential buyer.
The only problem? Kingbee couldn’t afford to acquire all of Fluid Truck’s assets on its own. And Fluid Truck couldn’t afford to keep the lights on for much longer. So in its bankruptcy filing, Fluid Truck has asked the courts to approve emergency funding in the form of a $7 million debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan from Kingbee and some existing investors, and the court approved it on an interim basis on Friday.
“The DIP lenders basically said, ‘We’re going to loan you this money, but if the sale doesn’t close by December 31, you’re in default, and we can liquidate the business,” Adam Stein-Sapir, a bankruptcy expert at Pioneer Funding Group, told TechCrunch. “It gives them a hammer to do something if [Fluid] blows past that deadline.”
It’s unclear how much Fluid Truck will be able to sell its assets for, but Stein-Sapir says it could be around that $7 million mark. That’s bad news for any unsecured lenders, like FVIP members, who will be among those last in line to be paid back.
“For people who are just unsecured here, it’s looking pretty grim in terms of recovery,” Stein-Sapir said. “Unless they filed a lien or have some kind of security in those funds, they are in some trouble.”
Fluid Truck did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

The San Francisco-based venture capital firm announced in a blog post on Thursday that it raised $700 million to invest in companies building in data and security, healthcare, or fintech. This fundraise brings the firm’s assets under management to $1.7 billion.
It’s unclear how much of the $700 million will go to the firm’s early-stage strategy, which invests $1 million to $15 million into seed and Series A companies, and how much will go for its discovery strategy, which cuts checks of $10 million to $20 million for Series B and Series C companies.
This news comes as the firm turns five years old, a milestone worth celebrating during a particularly tough year for venture funds and fundraising. So far this year, U.S. VC firms have raised $65.1 billion across 305 funds, according to PitchBook data. While 2024’s fundraising totals are on track to surpass 2023, it will still pale in comparison to any year past 2019.
The firm was likely still able to fundraise in these tougher conditions due to its notable portfolio so far.
Acrew has seen multiple exits so far, including corporate spending platform Divvy, which sold to BILL for $2.5 billion in May 2021, and creator platform Superpeer, which was acquired by Skillshare for an undisclosed amount earlier this year, among others.
The firm is also investors in notable private companies, including At-Bay, an insurance cybersecurity startup that was last valued at $1.3 billion, and Pie Insurance, a small business insurance startup, that PitchBook estimates is valued at nearly $1 billion.
Acrew was launched in 2019 by Theresia Gouw, Lauren Kolodny, Vishal Lugani, Asad Khaliq, and Mark Kraynak, all of whom are still in the same roles at the firm. Acrew’s first fund was $258 million."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/why-changes-to-the-block-on-elon-musks-x-are-driving-users-away/,Why changes to the block on Elon Musk's X are driving users away | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-10-18,"Elon Musk’s X is planning to make a change to how the block function works, breaking from the established standards of other social media apps. When the policies around blocking change, people who have been blocked by someone will still be able to see that person’s posts, so long as they’re public. They just won’t be able to like, repost, or reply to these posts.
“Blocking public posts makes no sense,” Musk said on X last year. “It needs to be deprecated in favor of a stronger form of mute.”
Jack Dorsey, a former co-founder and CEO of Twitter, agreed with this sentiment. In a sense, Dorsey and Musk do have a point. On most social media platforms, if someone blocks you, you can still find their public posts — you just have to log out of your own account. But Tracy Chou, founder of the anti-harassment tool Block Party, argues that this extra bit of friction matters.
Chou wrote on X, “i’m sure someone from twitter (elon) is arguing that block evasions were always possible from other accounts but the point is that friction matters!! making it easy for a creeper to creep is not a good thing!!”
Many X users agreed with Chou, generating increased interest in other platforms. Bluesky, a Twitter alternative, has added another 1.2 million users over the past two days, as users looked for an alternative to X. On the U.S. App Store’s top charts, Bluesky climbed to No. 2 in the Social Networking category, up from No. 181 the previous day.
These spurts of growth don’t always translate to long-term usage. But, as opposed to some other platform updates — like its name change from Twitter to X — this policy change isn’t just symbolic. It’s a move that prioritizes the experiences of people being blocked, rather than those doing the blocking, who are often more immediately at risk.
“Today, block can be used by users to share and hide harmful or private information about those they’ve blocked,” X’s engineering team wrote in a post. “Users will be able to see if such behavior occurs with this update, allowing for greater transparency.”
This stance can be alienating for users who are more concerned about their own safety than this cherry-picked scenario, in which they could be blocked by someone who then shares information about them.
Claire Waxman, who serves in the London Mayor’s Office as the appointed Victims’ Commissioner, is also concerned how the changes could impact victims of abuse.
“This is a dangerous decision for a social media platform, and will have serious implications for victims — especially those being stalked — and their safety,” Waxman wrote on X. “Enabling blocked users to see posts is catering to abusers and stalkers, indulging and facilitating their behaviors.”
Colten Meisner, an assistant professor at North Carolina State University who studies social media harassment, agrees.
“The block feature has been a first line of defense for people being harassed,” Meisner told TechCrunch. “It feels like there’s no other way to interpret this policy change but to say, ‘Victims of harassment, the first line of defense you’ve had, we’re now going to take away.’ Because if you want views, if you want visibility, that’s what it comes with on X.”
Meisner also sees a trend in how Musk’s personal beliefs and vendettas have been reflected in platform policy.
“[Musk] is definitely the archetype of the person that’s being blocked, and so it almost feels like a childish retaliation in some sense,” Meisner said. “Elon specifically has had this history of making policy changes basically at his own whims.”
For instance, X has suppressed links to its competitors, like Substack and Mastodon at various times. The platform also once singled out NPR with a “state-affiliated media” label, which is usually reserved for publications without editorial independence from their government (NPR receives less than 1% of its $300 million annual budget from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is federally funded).
On a platform that has already generated marked rises in hate speech, the changes to the block feature are a harbinger of the same trend continuing.
“This policy change is just a massive backstep in the history of harassment,” Meisner added."

Want it in your inbox every Friday? Sign up here.
This week brought us some exciting fundraising news from around the world, and even some exits. But if you are looking for tech IPOs, you will have to look at India. Meanwhile in the U.S., startups could help data centers reduce their environmental impact.
As mentioned, we have some exits to report on, despite another reminder that not all startups will make it — even when they are backed by YC.
Open space: Table Space, an Indian startup that provides managed workspaces, is planning to IPO next year at a $2.5 billion valuation, according to sources. As TechCrunch’s Manish Singh noted, “the Indian market has delivered more tech IPOs this year than the U.S. as valuation multiples approach all-time highs in the South Asian market.”
Trail mix: Cybersecurity unicorn Cyera made its first acquisition with Trail Security, a data loss prevention startup it bought for $162 million in cash and shares. Cyera is also looking to raise more funding for itself — some $200 million at a valuation nearing $3 billion, sources confirmed.
Engaging: Analytics software company Amplitude bought Command AI, a San Francisco-based app user engagement startup previously known as CommandBar. Most of its team of 30 people will be joining Amplitude, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021. The deal was priced at “north of $45 million,” a source told TechCrunch.
Fintech struggles: CapWay, a fintech startup that was part of Y Combinator’s summer 2020 cohort, is no more. Its goal was to bring financial services to “banking deserts.”
Making data centers more efficient is a promise that keeps attracting funding, but capital also flew to other interesting startups in a variety of sectors and countries.
Reaction time: X-Energy, a nuclear tech startup, raised a $500 million Series C-1 round led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund. This comes at a time when cloud giants are exploring cleaner ways to power their data centers.
The power of light: Lightmatter raised a $400 million Series D at a $4.4 billion valuation to reduce the energy demand of data centers and AI models thanks to photonic chips. Xscape Photonics, another startup in this space, raised $57 million to grow its team and scale production.
Diamond in the trash: Japanese startup Ookuma Diamond Device (ODD) raised around $27 million to build a diamond semiconductor manufacturing facility that will produce chips to be used in removing radioactive debris.
Broader inclusion: Fable, a Toronto-based startup that helps companies build digital products that can more easily be used by people with disabilities, raised $25 million in new funding. The capital will help fund new teams and products focusing on accessibility tools for cognitive and hearing impairments.
Space for Earth: OroraTech, a German startup using satellites to detect wildfires, raised $25 million to grow its market and cover more of Earth.
Micro gone big: 20VC, the venture firm named after Harry Stebbings’ podcast series, is moving further away from its micro-VC days. It closed a new $400 million fund, with the goal to “make Europe great again,” Stebbings said.
Money hunt: Regulatory filing revealed that VC firm Buckley Ventures is seeking to raise a fourth $250 million fund. It was founded in 2019 by Josh Buckley, who was also Product Hunt CEO between 2020 and 2023. Its previous fund closed at $337 million, according to PitchBook.
Nordic winds: Node.vc, a VC firm focused on the Nordics and Baltics, closed its €71 million first fund. Launched in 2023, it is part of a new crop of European venture firms that claim to operate as “entrepreneurs backing entrepreneurs.”
The startup world lost one of its own this week, as our former TechCrunch colleague Steve O’Hear passed away much too soon at the age of 49. The heartbreaking news also put into light how thankful many founders were for his support over the years. Our thoughts go out to his family, his friends, and his team at communications consultancy O’Hear & Co, which intends to live on and build on his legacy."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/microsoft-could-end-up-with-substantial-equity-in-the-restructured-for-profit-openai/,"Microsoft could end up with substantial equity in the restructured, for-profit OpenAI | TechCrunch",Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-18,"How much equity in OpenAI will Microsoft get once the former becomes a for-profit company? That’s the multibillion-dollar question — one the two parties are racing to answer ahead of a two-year deadline.
The Wall Street Journal reports that both Microsoft and OpenAI have hired investment banks to negotiate Microsoft’s equity — which could be substantial. The tech giant is said to have sunk nearly $14 billion into OpenAI. As of October, OpenAI is the second-most valuable startup in the U.S. behind SpaceX.
Among other issues, Microsoft and OpenAI must resolve how much equity will go to CEO Sam Altman and OpenAI employees, as well as which specific governance rights Microsoft will have. Once OpenAI converts to a for-profit, it’ll become a public-benefit corporation, but with a nonprofit component that’ll own equity in the restructured company.
The negotiations come as OpenAI’s president, Greg Brockman, is reportedly planning to return from an extended leave as soon as November."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/wp-engine-files-an-injuction-to-get-its-wordpress-org-access-back/,WP Engine files an injunction to get its WordPress.org access back | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-18,"Web hosting provider WP Engine has filed an injunction in a court in Northern California, asking it to intervene and restore its access to the WordPress.org open source repository.
After WP Engine filed a lawsuit against WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg and Automattic last month, Mullenweg — who also owns WordPress.org — blocked the company’s access to the open source project.
This also meant that WP Engine couldn’t update its Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plug-in, which is used to create and customize their edit screens. Earlier this month, WordPress took control of ACF and forked it, citing developer guidelines, which gives them control to change a plug-in “without developer consent, in the name of public safety.”
With the latest filing, WP Engine seeks to restore the “status quo as it existed prior to September 20, 2024” in terms of the company’s access to the open source repo.
“WPE respectfully requests that the Court issue a preliminary injunction restoring and preserving the status quo as it existed prior to Defendants’ wrongful actions described above. The preliminary injunction requires no security because returning the situation to the status quo will have no negative effect on Defendants,” the court filing read.
The company added that these protections should also be extended to its affiliates, partners, employees, users, and customers.
Notably, Mullenweg earlier this month added a new checkbox to the WordPress.org contributor login, asking people to verify that they were not associated with WP Engine in any way. At that time, contributors said that they were banned from the community Slack for criticizing the move.
In a separate declaration attached to the filing, WP Engine’s CEO Heather Brunner said that until recently, she thought that “wordpress.org was associated with and/or owned by the nonprofit WordPress Foundation.”
“Automattic vehemently denies WP Engine’s allegations — which are gross mischaracterizations of reality — and reserves all of our rights,” an Automattic spokesperson said. “Automattic is confident in our legal position and will vigorously litigate against this baseless filing, as well as pursue all remedies against WP Engine.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/bluesky-surges-into-the-top-5-as-x-changes-blocks-permits-ai-training-on-its-data/,"Bluesky surges into the top 5 as X changes blocks, permits AI training on its data | TechCrunch",Sarah Perez,2024-10-18,"Social networking startup Bluesky, which just reported a gain of half a million users over the past day, has now soared into the top five apps on the U.S. App Store and has become the No. 2 app in the Social Networking category, up from No. 181 a week ago, according to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures. The growth is entirely organic, we understand, as Appfigures confirmed the company is not running any App Store Search Ads.
In addition, the growth is not limited to the U.S. market, either. A number of countries are showing four-digit growth in downloads, compared to last Wednesday, leading Bluesky to enter the top 10 in countries like Japan, Thailand, and Taiwan, where it’s No. 1; Hong Kong, where it’s No. 2; Canada and South Korea, where it’s No. 4; and Singapore, where it’s No. 8.
While data on the app’s growth on Google Play is delayed, the early indications are that it’s rising there, too. At 4 a.m. EST, the app moved from No. 100 on the Android app store to No. 5 in the Social Networking category, and it is continuing to climb.
Appfigures can’t yet account for Bluesky’s claimed half a million new users over the course of a day, but its estimates do confirm a massive growth spurt. So far, the firm is seeing 197,000 new installs on the App Store on Thursday, up from just 3,400 the day prior. The majority of those — 80,000, or 40% — came from the U.S. Japan also contributed with 53,000 installs (27%), and downloads have grown by four digits in around 90 total countries, Appfigures tells TechCrunch.
As to what’s driving the surge, there are likely several factors working in combination.
On X, users are understandably upset over the company’s decision to change how the block function operates. Soon, users with public accounts can have their X posts viewed by anyone, including those they’ve blocked, unlike before. Blocked users will only be prevented from engaging with those posts by liking, replying, and reposting, for instance. That introduces a safety issue for many who use the platform but face harassment and abuse, and for some, it was the final straw.
In addition, X updated its Terms of Service and Privacy policy this week, giving it the right to share X user data with third parties, including those companies developing AI models.
X may also still be feeling the effects from the earlier Brazil ban, though lifted, which saw some active users from that region making the shift to Bluesky, possibly pulling their followers with them.
Plus, Bluesky could be benefiting from the moderation issues plaguing Threads, which saw users getting their accounts banned or their posts downranked for no reason. (Meta had partially attributed the problem to internal software used by Threads’ moderators.)
In any event, X isn’t yet feeling the impacts of the changes, adding 17,000 downloads between Tuesday and Thursday. However, the app is no longer in the U.S. App Store’s top 10, now sitting at No. 29. The Elon Musk-owned app is seeing a mild downward trend, Appfigures says, but this is in line with the entire news category in the U.S. App Store being down 8.4% this year.
Bluesky has seen big surges before, including when it opened its doors to the public after a long invite-only phase and more recently, when Brazil banned X, driving half a million new users to the social networking startup over the first two days of the ban, and more in the days that followed.
(After publication, Bluesky announced it had added 1 million new users, driving its total user count to over 12 million.)"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/teslas-full-self-driving-software-under-investigation-by-federal-safety-regulator/,Tesla's Full Self-Driving software under investigation by federal safety regulator | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-18,"The top U.S. automotive safety regulator has opened a new investigation into Tesla’s so-called “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” software after four reported crashes in low-visibility situations — including one where a pedestrian was killed.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation announced Friday that it is probing the driver assistance system to find out whether it can “detect and respond appropriately to reduced roadway visibility conditions,” such as “sun glare, fog, or airborne dust.” The agency also wants to know if other crashes have occurred in these conditions beyond the ones that were reported.
The investigation comes just one week after Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed the prototype of his company’s “Cybercab,” a two-seater car that he said is supposed to serve as a robotaxi, following years of unmet promises. Musk also claimed at the event that Tesla’s Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV would be able to operate without supervision in California and Texas at some point in 2025, though he did not offer any details about how that will happen.
In April, NHTSA closed a nearly three-year probe into Autopilot, the less-capable driver assistance software that Tesla offers, after investigating almost 500 crashes where the system was active. The agency found 13 of those crashes were fatal. At the same time that it closed that probe, NHTSA opened a new investigation into the recall fix that Tesla had issued to address problems with Autopilot.
Tesla’s software also faces other legal threats. The Department of Justice is investigating the claims Tesla has made about its driver-assistance features, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles has accused Tesla of inflating the software’s capabilities.
The company also faces a number of lawsuits over Autopilot crashes. It settled one of the most high-profile cases that was set to go to trial earlier this year. The company has said in the past that it makes drivers aware they are supposed to constantly monitor Full Self-Driving and Autopilot and be ready to take over at any moment.
The new investigation announced Friday specifically calls out four crashes where the Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system was active, all occurring between November 2023 and May 2024.
The November 2023 crash happened in Rimrock, Arizona. It involved a Model Y that struck and killed a pedestrian. Another crash happened in January 2024 in Nipton, California, where a Model 3 crashed into another car on the highway during a dust storm. In March 2024 a Model 3 crashed into another car on the highway in Red Mills, Virginia during cloudy conditions. And in May 2024, a Model 3 crashed into a stationary object on a rural road in Collinsville, Ohio in foggy conditions. NHTSA noted that someone was injured in the May 2024 crash.
NHTSA’s defects investigations team splits its probes into four levels: Defect Petition, Preliminary Evaluation, Recall Query and Engineering Analysis. The agency classified this new investigation as a preliminary evaluation. NHTSA normally tries to complete these types of probes within eight months.
This story has been updated with more details from NHTSA’s filings."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/nebius-to-resume-nasdaq-trading-after-severing-ties-with-russia-and-yandex/,Nebius to resume Nasdaq trading after severing ties with Russia and Yandex | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-18,"Nebius, the company formerly known as Yandex that’s now focused on cloud infrastructure for AI uses (aka “AI compute”), is to begin trading on the public markets once again — more than two years after the Nasdaq halted trading due to economic sanctions imposed in the wake of Russia’s Ukraine invasion in 2022.
The Netherlands-based company is vying to become one of Europe’s leading players in the burgeoning “GPU-as-a-service” space, and sits in a somewhat unique position — it is a startup in many ways as it’s starting out afresh as a new business, but being a public company means that anyone can invest in it as an alternative to the usual U.S. hyperscalers such as Alphabet or Microsoft.
Founded in 1997, most people know Yandex as the “Google of Russia,” building everything from search engines and advertising products to maps and autonomous vehicles. Yandex’s core market was very much its domestic Russia plus a handful of neighboring countries, however its parent was a Dutch holding organization called Yandex N.V. which went public on the Nasdaq in 2011, followed by a secondary listing three years later on the Moscow Exchange.
Yandex N.V. was doing well as a public company, reaching a valuation of $31 billion at the end of 2021 before the Russia-Ukraine conflict kickstarted a series of global sanctions against companies in the region, and also individuals. Yandex co-founder and CEO Arkady Volozh was forced to resign after the European Union placed him on a sanctions list, although he was removed from the list in March 2024, which paved the way for his return as CEO of the next version of Yandex N.V.
That next version is Nebius, and its business is based on one of Yandex N.V.’s few remaining assets outside of Russia: a Finnish data center and AI cloud business called Nebius AI. The new entity formally emerged back in July, outlining its plans to be a “European AI compute leader,” similar to something like CoreWeave — a company that is also in the midst of expanding into Europe, raising a ton of equity and debt en-route.
While the Nasdaq had said in 2022 that it would delist Yandex and several other Russian-affiliated companies, Yandex appealed and the Nasdaq agreed to maintain its listing — but kept a halt on trading as it went about severing its Russian ties. With those ties terminated earlier this year, and $2 billion in the bank from selling its Russian assets, Volozh said at the time that he intended to continue Nebius as a public company, as it was an easier and cheaper way to access capital, in what is a very capital-intensive business.
“Our ambition is to build one of the world’s largest specialist AI infrastructure businesses,” Volozh said in a statement. “This requires access to technological expertise, graphics processing units and capital. These are exactly what we have.”
Nebius said its Class A ordinary shares will resume trading on Monday, October 21, 2024."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/byjus-founder-says-his-edtech-startup-once-worth-22b-is-now-worth-zero/,"Byju's founder says his edtech startup, once worth $22B, is now 'worth zero' | TechCrunch",Manish Singh,2024-10-18,"Byju Raveendran, the founder of the embattled edtech group Byju’s, acknowledged on Thursday afternoon that he made mistakes, mistimed the market, overestimated growth potential, and that his startup, once valued at $22 billion, is now effectively worth “zero.”
Speaking to a group of journalists, Raveendran said the company’s aggressive acquisition of more than two dozen startups to expand into new markets proved fatal when financing dried up in 2022. Byju’s was planning to go public in early 2022 with several investment bankers giving the firm valuation as high as $50 billion, TechCrunch reported earlier.
He alleged that many of his more than 100 investors had urged him to pursue aggressive expansion into as many as 40 markets. But, he added, those very investors got cold feet when global markets tumbled following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, sending the venture capital market into a downward spiral.
Raveendran said many of his investors “ran away,” and the departure of three key backers — Prosus Ventures, Peak XV, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative — from the company’s board last year made it impossible for the startup to raise additional funds.
Representatives of the aforementioned three firms as well as auditor Deloitte left the startup’s board last year, citing governance issues.
Byju’s has since entered insolvency proceedings, and Raveendran, who no longer controls the company, said: “It’s worth zero. What valuation are you talking about? It’s worth zero.”
Byju’s, once India’s most valuable startup, counts BlackRock, UBS, Lightspeed, QIA, Bond, Silver Lake, Sofina, Verlinvest, Tencent, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, General Atlantic, Tiger Global, Owl Ventures, and World Bank’s IFC among its backers. It has raised more than $5 billion to date.
Raveendran said he remains hopeful that his startup will make a comeback. “I have nothing to lose. I came from a small village. I invested everything I had into the startup.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/the-surprising-way-openai-could-get-out-of-its-pact-with-microsoft/,The surprising way OpenAI could get out of its pact with Microsoft | TechCrunch,Connie Loizos,2024-10-18,"The New York Times on Thursday published a look at the “fraying” relationship between OpenAI and its investor, partner, and, increasingly, rival, Microsoft, reporting their five-year romance has cooled owing to financial pressure on OpenAI, the limited computing power Microsoft is providing OpenAI, and disagreements between the two about ground rules.
Most fascinating perhaps is a reported clause in OpenAI’s contract with Microsoft that cuts off Microsoft’s access to OpenAI’s tech if the latter develops so-called artificial general intelligence (AGI), meaning an AI system capable of rivaling human thinking.
TC has asked OpenAI for comment, but the Times — which talked with 19 people familiar with the companies’ relationship — says the clause aims to ensure Microsoft can never misuse the technology. Thing is, OpenAI’s board can reportedly decide when AGI has arrived, and CEO Sam Altman has already said that moment will be somewhat subjective.
As he told this editor early last year, “The closer we get, the harder time I have answering [how far away AGI is] because I think that it’s going to be much blurrier and much more of a gradual transition than people think.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/former-watch-trader-is-now-building-the-aws-of-grid-storage-terralayr/,"Former watch trader is now building the AWS of grid storage, Terralayr | TechCrunch",Tim De Chant,2024-10-18,"Philipp Man was burned out. He had founded a watch trading company with his flatmate, Ludwig Wurlitzer, but the grind was wearing him down.
“We did that for ten years,” Man said. “It’s very difficult to keep yourself motivated when you know the whole reason for your operation is to sell expensive stuff to wealthy people.”
He had previously been worked on the jet fuel team at Glencore — “the evil side of energy,” he said — and felt himself drawn back to that world. “I wanted to go back to energy, do something that had real impact, for profit, but that helps the planet.”
Climate seemed an obvious starting point. Germany, where he’s from, was being flooded with wind and solar power, and as the country turned off its nuclear power plants, it needed a way to keep the grid humming on calm, cloudy days.
Grid-scale batteries help save renewably generated power for just such days, and they have boomed in recent years, with global capacity tripling in 2023, according to BloombergNEF. Analysts at the firm also expect capacity to nearly triple again before the end of the decade.
“The industry, while still very nascent, has been built the wrong way around,” Man said. “Today, people build a battery, and then somebody else trades it.”
Man’s alternative, which has taken shape as a startup called Terralayr, is a twist on the virtual power plant, what experts call it when energy traders aggregate batteries and manage their use. He said Terralayr, which he also co-founded with Wurlitzer, is similar to AWS, Amazon’s cloud service that aggregates computing resources and sells fractions of them. “We aggregate grid-scale energy storage assets, we bundle them, we virtualize them, and then we sell off the capacity between 15 minutes and 15 years,” Man said.
AWS transformed enterprise computing, allowing companies to run servers without owning hardware and quickly scale them as needed. In some ways, virtual power plants do the same. Owners of grid-scale batteries can sell their capacity to traders, who then aggregate that capacity to the point where it makes sense to play in large electricity markets.
Terralayr also manages batteries, both its own and those of others, but Man said the difference is that it doesn’t function as a trader, but something more like an exchange. “Our pitch is like, we’re not traders. We don’t trade at all. In fact, we will just find the best buyer for your capacity.”
The startup charges battery owners a “small percentage” fee based on revenues. If Terralayr can operate the battery more profitably than a competitor, it will also take a portion of the upside. (How is that determined? Man said the company uses a model, built in part using previous bids from its own customers, that predicts what a typical trader would do.)
For buyers, power trading allows them to fill gaps in their output. For somewhere like Germany, where Terralayr is starting out, power providers need to predict how much electricity they’ll generate in the next 24 hours. If they fail to match their forecast — like if a freak thunderstorm clouds their solar farm — they can be penalized. By tapping into a battery array that’s selling power at the same time, they can bridge the gap and avoid costly penalties.
Terralayr currently has 7 megawatt-hours of capacity on the grid with another 40 megawatt-hours that should be turned on soon, Man said. The startup has signed development agreements for over 200 sites in Germany totaling over 7 gigawatts, or about 3% of Germany’s total generating capacity. “That’s a five- to ten-year horizon,” he added. “Of those 7 gigawatts, not everything will come through.”
To fund the expansion, Terralayr has raised €62 million in equity and €15 million in debt from investors, including Creandum, Earlybird, Norrsken VC, Picus Capital, and Rive Private Investment. “I wouldn’t call it seed round, but that’s technically what it is,” Man said, adding that “seed would wrongly suggest the earliness of the business.”
While Terralayr is focused on Germany for now, Man said the company is eyeing U.S. markets, particularly California and Texas. “We believe this is a generational opportunity,” he said."

The Amazon executive recently told employees who don’t like the new five-day in-person work policy that, “there are other companies around,” presumably companies they can work for remotely, Reuters reported on Thursday.
Amazon’s top boss, Andy Jassy, told employees last month that there will be a full return-to-office starting in 2025, an increase from three days for roughly the last year.
Garman is the latest tech CEO to put his foot down on remote work, but he’s not the first. Earlier this year, Dell reportedly told employees they won’t be considered for promotions if they don’t come into the office. That said, remote work likely isn’t going anywhere for most people. Studies suggest most remote workers would quit if they had to return to the office.
Amazon did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/automattic-offered-employees-another-chance-to-quit-this-time-with-nine-months-severance/,Automattic offered employees another chance to quit — this time with nine months' severance | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-17,"Days after 159 people accepted Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg’s offer of a six-month severance package to employees who wanted to leave, the company floated a new offer late on October 16 of a nine-month severance package to anybody who quit immediately. Employees had four hours to decide whether they wanted to take the deal.
In a Slack message seen by TechCrunch, Mullenweg posted that people who accepted the offer would lose access not only to Automattic but also to WordPress.org. This effectively means that people leaving wouldn’t be able to contribute to the open source project — at least under their existing ID. This would also mean they would be effectively banned from the WordPress community. News of the deal was earlier reported by 404 Media.
Apart from being Automattic CEO, Mullenweg also owns and controls WordPress.org’s open source site.
Mullenweg gave just four hours’ notice and said people who want to accept the offer should DM him, “I resign and would like to take the 9-month buy-out offer.”
“You don’t have to say any reason or anything else. I will reply ‘Thank you.’ Automattic will accept your resignation, you can keep your office stuff and work laptop. You will lose access to Automattic and Worg,” Mullenweg said.
He said, “I guess some people were sad they missed the last window,” and so presented this new short window.
Automattic didn’t comment on the story by the time of publication. It is not clear if any employees took the new offer. The company’s headcount currently stands at 1,731, according to its website; a few hours ago, it stood at 1,732.
The WordPress co-founder’s first offer was aimed at people who didn’t align with his views on Automattic’s fight with hosting provider WP Engine. The first batch of people who left Automattic included some top people at the company, including the head of WordPress.com (Automattic’s commercial WordPress hosting arm), Daniel Bachhuber; head of programs and contributor experience Naoko Takano; the principal architect for AI, Daniel Walmsley; and WordPress.org’s executive director Josepha Haden Chomphosy.
The battle started nearly a month ago after Mullenweg called WP Engine “a cancer to WordPress” and accused the independent firm of not contributing enough to the WordPress open source project. Over the last few weeks, the fight has involved cease-and-desist letters, Automattic accusing WP Engine of violating trademarks, a lawsuit by WP Engine, and WordPress.org blocking WP Engine’s access and taking over a plug-in it had been maintaining.
Earlier this week, TechCrunch reported that Automattic has been preparing to defend its trademarks by involving “nice and not nice” lawyers, according to an internal post published earlier this year by the company’s then-chief legal officer.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/elon-musks-x-is-changing-its-privacy-policy-to-allow-third-parties-to-train-ai-on-your-posts/,Elon Musk's X is changing its privacy policy to allow third parties to train AI on your posts | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-10-17,"On Wednesday, social network X (formerly Twitter) updated its Privacy Policy to indicate that it would allow third-party “collaborators” to train their AI models on X data, unless users opt out. While X owner Elon Musk trained xAI’s Grok AI chatbot on X user data, leading to an investigation by the EU’s lead privacy regulator, the company hadn’t yet amended its policy to indicate its data may also be used by third parties.
The addition to the policy implies that X, like Reddit and various media organizations, is looking into licensing data to AI companies as a potential new revenue stream.
In Section 3 of the updated Privacy Policy titled “Sharing Information,” X added a paragraph detailing how X user data can be used and how users could opt out.
It reads:
“Third-party collaborators. Depending on your settings, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.”
The policy points to the settings page on X, but does not specifically indicate where users would go within the settings to toggle off data-sharing. Currently, the “Privacy and safety” section in settings lets users turn on or off data-sharing with xAI’s Grok and with other “business partners,” but the latter is described as those companies that X may work with to “run and improve its products,” not other AI providers.
That may be because the updated privacy policy won’t become effective until November 15, at which point the opt-out option could be added. (We hope.)
In addition, the company removed a paragraph that said it keeps user “profile information and content for the duration of your account,” and that it keeps other “personally identifiable data we collect when you use our products and services for a maximum of 18 months.”
Instead, the new section explains that X will keep “different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.” As an example, it notes that usage information like the “content you post” and your interactions with others’ content will be kept for “the duration of your account or until such content is removed.”
The policy also added a note reminding users that public content can exist elsewhere even after it’s removed from X. This could potentially cover the data’s ingestion by AI providers, as X adds, “search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X.”
Separately, X has added a new “Liquidated Damages” section to its updated Terms of Service that says any organization scraping its content will be liable for damages. Specifically, “for requesting, viewing, or accessing more than 1,000,000 posts (including reply posts, video posts, image posts, and any other posts) in any 24-hour period,” X says the organization will be charged $15,000 USD per 1,000,000 posts.
The move to monetize X data follows advertiser withdrawals and boycotts and a subscription feature that has yet to take off, which have left the company in need of new ways to pay its bills.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/sam-altmans-worldcoin-becomes-world-and-shows-new-iris-scanning-orb-to-prove-your-humanity/,Sam Altman's Worldcoin becomes World and shows new iris-scanning Orb to prove your humanity | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-10-17,"Worldcoin, the Sam Altman co-founded “proof of personhood” crypto project that scans people’s eyeballs, announced on Thursday that it dropped the “coin” from its name and is now just “World.” The startup behind the World project, Tools for Humanity, also unveiled its next generation of iris-scanning “Orbs” and other tools at a live event in San Francisco.
Co-founder and CEO of Tools for Humanity, Alex Blania, said the project’s old name “just doesn’t work anymore,” potentially signaling the startup is looking to expand its identity beyond its original cryptocurrency mission. (Eye-scanning initially was seen as a way to get access to Worldcoins, though the founders say this never happened.)
OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, spends a good chunk of his time working on World, Blania told TechCrunch during a press conference, but said the two startups’ missions are independent from each other. However, Blania didn’t rule out that World’s cryptocurrency could be incorporated into ChatGPT one day.
“Well, he’s a co-founder and he’s been so from the beginning. So, we talk a couple times a week. He’s involved in all the decisions,” Blania told TechCrunch.
“Of course, he’s focused on OpenAI,” Blania continued. “How tied is World’s success to OpenAI? I think actually not at all. I think these are two very separate missions, and I think AI is heading where it’s heading, and we think what we built here is very important infrastructure for the world, and that will not change.”
The World project is predicated on the idea that advanced AI systems — like the one Altman’s OpenAI is trying to build — will one day make it impossible to tell whether you are talking to a human online. Its solution is “human verification services” based around blockchain. The startup also promises to make the benefits of AI accessible to everyone, potentially by redistributing the wealth generated by AI to people through its Worldcoins.
If all this sounds a bit dubious, you’re not the only one who thinks so. Governments around the world — including Kenya and countries in the EU — have probed and suspended Worldcoin over the years over privacy, security, and financial concerns. The Kenya investigation concluded, allowing World to continue operating, but some of those EU investigations are ongoing, and World’s fate there remains uncertain.
Altman and Blania detailed World’s four-step roadmap onstage Thursday. The first and second steps — developing the Orb and building a distributed ownership network with blockchain — are already done, Blania said. The last step is redistributing the benefits of AI, but before we get to that, we have to complete the third step: scale. World had several announcements on Thursday, including the launch of a new blockchain and a new app, but they all revolved around scaling up the company’s 7 million verified humans to something much larger.
In order to do that, the World team needs to scan more eyeballs across the globe. And to that end, Tools for Humanity unveiled its next-generation Orb on Thursday. The startup promised everyone (including TechCrunch) attending the live event would receive an Orb to take home, though it’s not immediately clear how individuals would put it to use.
The new Orb is easier to mass-produce, has fewer parts, and operates three times faster. Tools for Humanity says people will soon be able to verify themselves at coffee shops, and announced a partnership with the No. 1 delivery service in Latin America, Rappi, so people can schedule a home Orb verification.
Also on Thursday, Tools for Humanity unveiled Deep Face, an attempt to combat online deepfakes and impersonation using the company’s human-verification services. The startup said Deep Face could be used to augment apps like FaceTime, Zoom, and X but provided no details on how that would happen.
The startup announced a beta of its World ID credential, an alternative to government IDs for use online. They aren’t meant to replace national IDs, an executive clarified during a press conference, but could let people verify their identities online without giving up too much extraneous information, like they might by uploading a driver’s license or passport.
Adoption may be an obstacle for the World project moving forward. At the event, Tools for Humanity asked guests to verify their own identity by presenting their government-issued ID. Trusting a cryptocurrency company with your identity is a big ask for most people, but especially one led by Sam Altman, who has been accused of lying to OpenAI’s board.
Correction: Tools for Humanity is the startup behind the project, World. A previous version of this story did not make clear that World is not a startup, itself."

The news comes two years after the FDA made hearing aids available to all Americans without a prescription.
The FCC has not yet issued a specific timeline for compliance, only noting that the rules will be fully in effect “after a transition period.” The rules discourage handset makers from instituting proprietary Bluetooth coupling, which could limit device compatibility with over-the-counter hearing aids.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/microsoft-said-it-lost-weeks-of-security-logs-for-its-customers-cloud-products/,Microsoft said it lost weeks of security logs for its customers' cloud products | TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,2024-10-17,"Microsoft has notified customers that it’s missing more than two weeks of security logs for some of its cloud products, leaving network defenders without critical data for detecting possible intrusions.
According to a notification sent to affected customers, Microsoft said that “a bug in one of Microsoft’s internal monitoring agents resulted in a malfunction in some of the agents when uploading log data to our internal logging platform” between September 2 and September 19.
The notification said that the logging outage was not caused by a security incident, and “only affected the collection of log events.”
Business Insider first reported the loss of log data earlier in October. Details of the notification have not been widely reported. As noted by security researcher Kevin Beaumont, the notifications that Microsoft sent to affected companies are likely accessible only to a handful of users with tenant admin rights.
Logging helps to keep track of events within a product, such as information about users signing in and failed attempts, which can help network defenders identify suspected intrusions. Missing logs could make it more difficult to identify unauthorized access to the customers’ networks during that two-week window.
The affected products include Microsoft Entra, Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and Purview, according to the Business Insider report. Affected customers “may have experienced potential gaps in security related logs or events, possibly affecting customers’ ability to analyze data, detect threats, or generate security alerts,” the notification said.
Microsoft would not answer specific questions about the logging outage, but a Microsoft executive confirmed to TechCrunch that the incident was caused by an “operational bug within our internal monitoring agent.”
“We have mitigated the issue by rolling back a service change. We have communicated to all impacted customers and will provide support as needed,” said John Sheehan, a Microsoft corporate vice president.
The logging outage comes a year after Microsoft came under fire from federal investigators for withholding security logs from certain U.S. federal government departments that host their emails on the company’s hardened, government-only cloud; investigators said having access to those logs could have identified a series of China-backed intrusions far sooner.
The China-backed intruders, referred to as Storm-0558, broke into Microsoft’s network and stole a digital skeleton key that allowed the hackers unfettered access to U.S. government emails stored in Microsoft’s cloud. According to a government-issued postmortem of the cyberattack, the State Department identified the intrusions because it paid for a higher-tier Microsoft license that granted access to security logs for its cloud products, which many other hacked U.S. government agencies did not have.
Following the China-backed hacks, Microsoft said it would start providing logs to its lower-paid cloud accounts from September 2023.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/experts-say-openais-patent-pledge-amounts-to-little-more-than-virtue-signaling/,Experts say OpenAI's patent pledge amounts to little more than 'virtue signaling' | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-17,"This week, OpenAI quietly published a statement on its website pledging not to use its patents offensively.
Asserting its commitment to the principles of “broad access” and “collaboration,” OpenAI said that it would only use its patents in a way that supports innovation. “We pledge to only use our patents defensively, so long as a party does not threaten or assert a claim, initiate a proceeding, help someone else in such activities against us, or engage in activities that harm us or our users,” wrote the company.
But experts say the claims are little more than fluff.
In contrast to patent pledges like IBM’s 2005 promise not to use 500 specific patents against open source software makers, OpenAI’s is ambiguous and vague, according to MBHB partner Mike Borella. It’s not clear what “defensively” means, exactly — or which activities OpenAI might perceive as “harming” the company or its users.
“The last phrase seems to be the exception that swallows the rule,” Borella told TechCrunch. “It can be read in so many different ways, including to cover all of OpenAI’s competitors in the marketplace and parties who fairly criticize ChatGPT’s deficiencies.”
OpenAI also doesn’t have much of a patent portfolio it could assert if it wanted to, he argued; its IP strategy is much more dependent on trade secrets — things like confidential training data and methods. Patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office aren’t generally published until 18 months after filing, but, at present, only a handful of OpenAI’s have been granted.
Then there’s the fact that OpenAI’s patent pledge is just that: a pledge. Voluntary, not binding, like a contract or warranty.
It’s not clear what, if any, legal weight it might have, says Shubha Ghosh, a Syracuse University professor specializing in IP law. In any case, it won’t limit OpenAI from enforcing its rights under copyright, trade secret, or contract laws, he noted.
“Computer source code that guides ChatGPT would be protected by copyright law and trade secret law,” Ghosh said. “Terms that OpenAI includes in its terms of service would still be enforceable as contracts. Should OpenAI engage in conduct that deviates from the pledge, for example by suing another company or an individual for patent infringement, what OpenAI has lost temporarily is credibility.”
Borella called OpenAI’s statement “public relations virtue-signaling”: an attempt to curry favor with the tech community and regulators, along the lines of Tesla’s ill-defined patent pledge in 2014.
“The statement as a whole ends up being nothing more than a paper tiger,” Borella said, “rather than a substantive attempt to foster healthy competition in the marketplace.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/marc-benioff-warns-that-ai-while-useful-is-overhyped-and-partly-blames-microsoft/,"Marc Benioff warns that AI, while useful, is overhyped and partly blames Microsoft | TechCrunch",Julie Bort,2024-10-17,"One of the tech industry’s biggest hype men, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, wants you to know that he is psyched about generative AI, but even he doesn’t think it can do what its biggest proponents say it will do. And he (not surprisingly) blames Microsoft.
A month after Salesforce’s enormous tech conference, Dreamforce, during which Benioff endlessly pitched, pumped, and lauded AI — at least as it’s used in Salesforce’s own products — he’s now on a setting-expectations tour. And he’s trash talking his biggest competitor and arch rival, Microsoft. He recently appeared on the podcast Rapid Response, hosted by former Fast Company editor-in-chief Bob Safian.
Talking about AI’s potential, he said, “I’ve never been more excited about anything at Salesforce, maybe in my career.”
But he also warned that “customers have been told things about enterprise AI, maybe AI overall, that are not true,” he said. “I think Microsoft has done a tremendous disservice to not only our whole industry but all of the AI research that has been done.”
Benioff had negative things to say in particular about Microsoft Copilot’s accuracy and usefulness. He even compared Copilot to Clippy, Microsoft’s widely panned 1990s talking paperclip cartoon that was supposed to be an assistant to Microsoft Office users.
“We may have heard from these AI priests and priestesses of these LLM model companies and Microsoft and others about AI is now curing cancer, and AI is curing climate change, and we all have to plug into these nuclear power plants to get these data centers. None of this is true,” Benioff said.
He was doubling down on a comment he made on X, where he said, “LLMs (Large Language Models) are not the direct bridge to AGI, and much of AI’s current potential is simply oversold. AI isn’t yet curing cancer or solving climate change as pundits claim.”
That was a dig at OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Earlier this summer, he postulated that with AI-enhanced health tech, “[m]aybe a future version will help discover cures for cancer,” Altman said at the Aspen Ideas Festival, reported Newsweek.
Benioff also cited some research by Gartner about Microsoft Copilot. A Gartner report released in April called “The Top 10 ‘Gotchas’ of Copilot for Microsoft 365” found that only a quarter of the organizations doing Copilot pilot programs are currently planning a large-scale rollout. That’s actually a pretty good number, given how young this tech is and how slow enterprises can be to adopt it. That said, Gartner also concluded that as Copilot improves, so will enterprise adoption.
Microsoft might point to market research conducted by Forrester that cited a slew of bottom-line benefits for small businesses that are using Copilot. Forrester found that Copilot led to a tiny uptick in revenue, while reducing operating costs and speeding new-hire onboarding, based on a survey of 266 small companies. However, we must note that this research was paid for by Microsoft. Make of that what you will.
Still, Benioff has a point that the GenAI we have today, while sometimes mind-blowing, is not ready to replace human workers in most cases. True, the podcast-making capabilities of Google’s NotebookLM — which can create bantering AI-generated hosts that explain material — is quite the party trick. Yet, it’s hard to see how such a thing will directly reduce the kind of soul-sucking menial labor tasks that bog down most corporate jobs.
Benioff is also spot-on that the one area where GenAI does seem to be doing a screaming good job with enterprises is AI agents. That ties in nicely with the Salesforce product he’s been hyping lately, Agentforce. A slew of other tech companies and startups are working on AI agent technologies, too, from building use case-specific ones, to offering platforms where businesses can build their own. Just a few examples include OutRival, Atlassian’s Rovo AI, and Sierra, the startup founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and Google vet Clay Bavor.
AI agents are especially finding their way into customer service, ranging from much improved website chat bots to field service guides. Examples include Zingtree, Talla, or Neuron7. Salesforce has offerings here, too.
AI agents are also finding success with sales, especially prospecting, the high-rejection rate cold-calling and emailing that is the bottom tier of every sales organization. Examples include Regie.ai, AiSDR, Artisan, and 11x.ai.
“I think we’ll have more than a billion agents running from Salesforce within the next 12 months,” Benioff speculated, based, he said, on getting about 10,000 customers at his tech conference to try it.
However, it’s also worth pointing out that there are other areas where LLMs are already valued and where Microsoft, specifically, does have game. Software programmers and engineers increasingly use them to help them test and debug or generate code examples, including with Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot. Countless startups are offering AI coding assistants as well, like JetBrains and Continue, to name just a couple.
Microsoft’s close relationship with OpenAI means that its cloud, Azure, is a popular choice for enterprises that are using LLM models to build their own GenAI apps, too. So, Microsoft’s tentacles into GenAI extend far beyond having Word write documents, having Excel whip up charts, or having Teams transcribe meetings.
At the same time, when the people who are literally talking up AI to sell their own AI products warn that the AI is overhyped, it’s safe to say that AI is overhyped.
“It’s about managing expectations while harnessing AI’s capabilities,” Benioff explained."

Longtime Google executive Nick Fox will replace Raghavan, who will now take on the role of chief technologist.
“Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career,” Pichai said in the announcement. “After 12 years leading teams across Google, he’ll return to his computer science roots and take on the role of Chief Technologist, Google. In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.”
Raghavan led the Gmail team in launching Smart Reply and Smart Compose, which were the email service’s first AI products. Since then, Raghavan has overseen the launch of AI Overviews and Circle to Search, along with AI features in Maps and Shopping, such as Immersive View and virtual try-on.
Pichai says Fox has “been instrumental in shaping Google’s AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar and his leadership team.”
Fox has helped launch products like Google Fi and RCS messaging.
In addition to the change in roles, Pichai announced that the Gemini app team led by Sissie Hsiao will join Google DeepMind under Demis Hassabis.
The executive writes that bringing the two teams together “will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app, make our post-training work proceed more efficiently and build on our great product momentum.”
The Google Assistant team will also become part of Google’s Platforms and Devices team so they can be closer to the products that they’re building for, Pichai says.
The changes announced today come as Google has been working to establish itself as a leader in AI. They also come as the company is facing several antitrust lawsuits."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/feds-arrest-man-who-allegedly-participated-in-hack-of-the-secs-x-account-boosting-bitcoins-price/,"Feds arrest man who allegedly participated in hack of the SEC's X account, boosting Bitcoin's price | TechCrunch",Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-10-17,"Federal authorities announced Thursday the arrest of a man in Alabama, accusing him of participating in the hack of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account earlier this year.
Eric Council Jr. was indicted in connection with the SEC X account hack, which happened on January 9, when the account published a post falsely announcing that the Commission had approved Bitcoin ETFs to be listed in securities exchanges in the country, a post that increased the price of Bitcoin by $1,000, according to a press release by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of Columbia.
According to the indictment against Council, he worked with other unnamed co-conspirators to perform a SIM swap on the phone account of a person who had access to the SEC’s X account, only identified as “C.L.”. Authorities alleged that Council received payments for performing SIM swaps, such as the one that led to the SEC X account hack.
On January 9, a co-conspirator sent Council instructions on how to SIM swap the phone of the person with access to the SEC account on X, as well as the personally identifying information of the person. Council then traveled to an AT&T store with a fake identity card for C.L. that he himself designed and printed, and claimed to be an FBI agent who had broken his phone and needed a new SIM card.
Council bought a new iPhone to perform the SIM swap, then used the phone to receive a reset code for the @SECGov account on X, and sent this code to a co-conspirator who hacked into the @SECGov account and posted the false post in question, the indictment claims. At that point, Council returned the iPhone for cash in Birmingham, Alabama, the indictment says.
Prosecutors wrote in the indictment that Council performed several Google searches, such as: “SECGOV hack,” “telegram sim swap,” “how can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI,” and “What are the signs that you are under investigation by law enforcement or the FBI even if you have not been contacted by them,” and “what are some signs that the FBI is after you.”
Council was charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud."

Kirsten is still out doing Kirsten things, so I (Rebecca Bellan) will continue to pass along all the tech mobility news that’s fit to print.
It’s been a week since Tesla’s flashy robotaxi reveal, and everyone seems to have differing opinions on what Elon Musk showcased and, crucially, what he left out.
Obviously the big deal was the robotaxi or Cybercab (not sure what Tesla is calling it these days). We expected one prototype to roll out onto the manicured streets of the Hollywood studio where the event was held, but instead we got 20 Cybercabs. They look like a smaller, sleeker Cybertruck — a design choice that shocked no one — and are built with no steering wheel or pedals. The vehicles can also only seat two passengers, an odd choice for a robotaxi and one that Musk didn’t explain. But he did provide yet another timeline he’s likely to miss — the start of robotaxi production is set for 2026 or 2027. Oh, and anyone can apparently purchase their very own for $30,000.
Musk also said he expects Tesla to release “unsupervised FSD” to Model Y and Model 3 vehicles in California and Texas in 2025. I have some thoughts about why that, and the mass production of robotaxis built without human controls, doesn’t seem feasible from a regulatory perspective.
The biggest surprise of the night was the unveiling of a Robovan, a sleek-looking autonomous bus that can carry up to 20 people and also transport goods. But aside from hand-waving at a miraculous, autonomous future, Musk didn’t provide timelines or a go-to-market strategy for this vehicle.
Nor did he provide much of that information for any of Tesla’s products showcased that night, including its Optimus bots (which, by the way, were remotely controlled by humans, something Musk did not disclose to excited investors).
And despite bullishness from many Tesla fans, including apparently Anthony Levandowski, that failure to provide clarity, coupled with concern over a lack of near-term growth opportunities, caused Tesla’s stock to tumble around 10% Friday after the event. And it hasn’t recovered much since.

Aerleum has come up with a way to take carbon dioxide out of the air and transform it into another compound. And it’s starting with methanol, an alcohol that can be burned as fuel in cargo ships or used to make aviation fuel. The startup raised $6 million in seed funding from 360 Capital and HTGF, with participation from Bpifrance, Marble, and Norrsken.
GM Ventures has invested $10 million into Forge Nano, a startup that’s developing a thin coating that could help improve the safety and lifetime of cathode-active materials and reduce overall battery costs.
Shiftmove, a platform for fleet management software, has acquired digital fleet management platform Optimum Automotive. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the deal allows Shiftmove to expand into France.
Voi has placed €50 million of senior secured bonds under a total framework of €125 million. The micromobility company will use the funds to scale its current 110,000 e-scooter and e-bike fleets, refinance existing debt, and generally keep the lights on.
Waymo has apparently hooked it up for the woman who created a livestream over the summer to show how the company’s robotaxis were honking at all hours of the night. She got seemingly never-ending free Waymo rides and even an ice cream party!
California cops are regretting their decision to replace their fleets with Tesla Model Ys.
Fisker’s plan to liquidate its assets has been accepted by its bankruptcy court. Also settled is who will pay for the labor costs associated with two of the automaker’s recalls.
General Motors has launched the GM Energy PowerBank, a stationary storage product that the company says will give EV owners the power to store and transfer energy from the grid, with the option of integrating with solar power. The company’s energy management products are now also available across the U.S.
Tesla’s Cybertruck is getting blowback in Europe as pedestrian safety advocates look at those pointy angles on that heavy truck and think, “That would really hurt if it hit someone.” That could lead to a poor safety rating, which could doom sales.
During Toyota’s Mobility Show Bizweek 2024, the automaker unveiled portable hydrogen cartridges that could reduce the size and weight of hydrogen tanks. The prototypes are designed to make hydrogen usage easier and safer.
Paladin’s 30-person team worked nights and weekends to help the police department in Asheville, North Carolina, after the city was hit by Hurricane Helene. Its software was able to control drones remotely, allowing them to help locate people and drop off supplies.
Google has introduced a feature that will help you find the cheapest flights for your next trip. Usually Google shows you the “best” options, based on price and convenience. But some of us are willing to go to the airport at 5 a.m. to save $50.
Glovo, the Spanish food delivery and quick-commerce service, is experimenting with adding a bunch of social features to drive more in-app activity. It’s also letting restaurants upload food prep videos to make you hungry and ready to throw your money at talented chefs.
I’ve been driving around a family member’s 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E GT Edition for the last few months, so I thought now’s as good a time as any to share my thoughts on the whip.
Now, I don’t do car reviews often, so I’m not sure if it’s okay to say that this car slaps. But it does. My favorite thing about this crossover? The acceleration. It can go from 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds, so there’s rarely a moment when I’m trying to make a swift left turn or change lanes in traffic when I think, “Oh no, I won’t make it! Best wait for a better opening.” That’s because electric motors mounted on the rear and both axles combine to make 480 horsepower and up to 634 pound-feet of torque, and you really feel it.
The Mach-E has three drive modes that adjust the car’s performance and experience: Engage, Whisper, and Unbridle. Engage is the most chill, Whisper gives you a more gradual acceleration and a lighter “coasting” deceleration response, and Unbridle makes you feel like you’re on the race track.
The battery life is pretty decent as well, at around a 300-mile capacity before needing a charge. I never really felt battery anxiety with it, but of course, I can charge it at home and don’t have to rely on America’s ailing EV charging infrastructure.
The vehicle’s appearance is also sporty and stylish, and inside it feels luxurious and sensible. There’s also decent storage space in the back, and the seats fold down nicely.
Some things I don’t love about it? It’s a bumpy ride if you’re in the backseat, and I’m not sure why that is exactly other than a vague idea about suspension issues. The car also beeps at you relentlessly, for safety reasons, when you’re getting too close to another object. But when you’re parallel parking in New York City and there’s a line of cars waiting impatiently to pass you on a one-way street, that additional beeping can really throw you off your game.
Finally, while the 15.5-inch screen is great for displaying GPS routing and other infotainment needs, I don’t love that certain car controls — like heating and cooling — have to be accessed through the screen because it takes my eyes off the road. Some features should remain buttons.
And while I know this isn’t a review of Ford’s latest Mustang Mach-E, hopefully it’ll help some of you out there considering whether it’s worth it to buy a used 2022 model.
What is “This week’s wheels”? It’s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we’re testing, whether it’s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike, or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/the-14-biggest-private-equity-acquisitions-of-public-tech-firms-in-2024-so-far/,The 14 biggest take-private PE acquisitions so far this year in tech | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-17,"The private equity realm has been pretty active so far in 2024, serving as a powerful “alternative” source of liquidity for technology startups and scale-ups in search of an exit. In August, TechCrunch reported that EQT had picked up a majority stake in cybersecurity firm Acronis at a valuation of around $4 billion, following in the footsteps of another exit, in which EQT snapped up enterprise middleware company WSO2 for $600 million.
However, private equity has also been busy in the public markets, with some big deals going down to transform underperforming companies with strong growth prospects. According to PitchBook, there were 136 take-private deals led by private equity firms in 2023, up 15% on the previous year. New data provided to TechCrunch by PitchBook indicates that by the midway point of 2024, there had been 97 such deals, meaning we’re roughly on course to match last year’s figure (give or take) if the current trajectory holds.
Of the take-private deals that have closed so far in 2024, 46 belong to the technology sector. TechCrunch has filtered through these transactions to identify deals specifically focused on product-centric companies (rather than IT consultancies or services firms), and pulled out all the acquisitions valued at $1 billion or more.
We’ve included transactions that have either already closed in 2024 or are set to close in 2024; this includes deals first announced last year.
Norwegian media group Schibsted spun out classifieds platform Adevinta as a stand-alone business in 2019. With existing online marketplaces in France, Spain, Brazil, and the U.K., Adevinta went on to acquire eBay’s classifieds business for $9.2 billion in 2020.
During the original spinout in 2019, Schibsted listed Adevinta on the Oslo Stock Exchange at a $6 billion valuation. In late 2023, news emerged that private equity firms Permira and Blackstone were leading a consortium to take Adevinta private in a deal worth 141 billion Norwegian crowns ($13 billion). That deal finally closed in May.
Six years after filing to go public, enterprise software company Smartsheet is now in the midst of being taken private, after Vista Equity Partners and Blackstone partnered to offer shareholders a chunky $8.4 billion in cash.
The Bellevue, Washington-based company had hit a mid-pandemic market value of more than $10 billion, well over its opening day IPO valuation of $1.5 billion. After a rough couple of years where it dropped to below $4 billion, the company has been on the ascendency for much of 2024, rising above the $7 billion mark before the two private equity firms swooped in with their bid — representing a 41% premium over its 90-day average price.
The acquisition is expected to conclude by the end of Smartsheet’s fiscal year-end, which is January 31, 2025. However, the agreement includes a 45-day “go shop” period that expires in early November, so technically Smartsheet is able to pursue alternative suitors for now, and terminate the existing agreement with Vista and Blackstone if it finds a better deal.
U.K.-based private equity firm Permira announced plans to acquire website builder Squarespace in May, in an all-cash deal valued at $6.9 billion.
Squarespace filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021, shortly after raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation. The company went on to reach a market cap high of $8 billion in mid-2021, but its stock went into free fall, dropping to a low of $2 billion in 2022. The company was already on the rebound this year, with its market cap soaring past $5 billion off the back of strong earnings, sparking Permira into action.
The deal eventually closed in mid-October at an increased valuation of $7.2 billion, after an advisory firm recommended that Squarespace shareholders reject the initial offer.
Canadian fintech Nuvei, which provides companies with a range of services spanning payments processing, risk management, currency conversion, and more, entered into an agreement in April to be taken private by Advent International in a deal worth $6.3 billion.
The Ryan Reynolds-backed company originally filed to go public in 2020 on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), followed by the Nasdaq in the U.S. a year later. The company hit a peak valuation of more than $24 billion in 2021 before hitting a low of $2.6 billion in October, 2023.
The deal is expected to close in late 2024 or early 2025 at the latest.
K-12 education software provider PowerSchool is in the middle of being taken private by Bain Capital, in a transaction that values the Folsom, California-based company at $5.6 billion.
PowerSchool was originally acquired by Apple in 2001 for $62 million in an all-stock deal, with Apple selling PowerSchool to Pearson five years later. Pearson then sold it on to Vista Equity Partners in 2015, with Onex Partners joining as investor three years later.
PowerSchool went public in 2021, with the NYSE listing giving the company an initial valuation of around $3.5 billion. It later surged to $5.5 billion in late 2021, before falling to $1.8 billion within a year and then hovering at around the $3.5 billion mark for the past couple of years.
The take-private transaction is expected to conclude in the second half of 2024.
U.K. cybersecurity giant Darktrace is set to go private in a $5.3 billion deal spearheaded by an entity called Luke Bidco Ltd., formed by private equity giant Thoma Bravo.
Founded in 2013, Darktrace raised some $230 million in VC funding and reached a private valuation of $1.65 billion, before going public on the London Stock Exchange in 2021 with an opening-day valuation of $2.4 billion. The full valuation based on Thoma Bravo’s offer amounts to $5.4 billion on a fully diluted basis, with the corresponding enterprise value sitting at $4.99 billion.
The deal is expected to close by the end of 2024.
Educational technology company Instructure first went public in 2015, but it was taken private by Thoma Bravo in a $2 billion transaction four years later.
In 2021, the private equity giant spun Instructure out once more as a public company on the NYSE, but its valuation generally hovered around the $3.5 billion mark. But KKR swooped in with a $4.8 billion bid in July, with plans to take the company private once more.
The deal is expected to close in late 2024.
Data analytics software provider Alteryx was taken private in a $4.4 billion deal.
Alteryx went public on the NYSE in 2017, with its shares soaring past the $12 billion mark in the intervening years. However, its market cap had been in free fall since 2021, hitting a low of $2 billion before Clearlake Capital Group and Insight Partners came in with their offer last December.
The take-private transaction closed in March this year.
First announced in October 2023, Vista Equity Partners bid $4 billion to take customer engagement software provider EngageSmart private in a deal valued at $4 billion. EngageSmart went public on the NYSE in 2021, with its market cap hovering around the $2 billion to $3 billion mark until Vista Equity Partners tabled its $4 billion offer.
The transaction closed in January, with the EngageSmart brand now in the process of being discontinued and replaced by two separate companies: InvoiceCloud and SimplePractice.
Pet-sitting marketplace Rover went public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC in 2021. At the tail end of 2023, Blackstone announced its intentions to acquire the company for $2.3 billion.
That all-cash transaction finally closed in February, with Rover now a private company once more.
Thoma Bravo first announced its intentions to acquire Everbridge, a critical event management software company, for $1.5 billion in early February. Following further negotiations, Thoma Bravo bumped that price up to $1.8 billion.
Founded in 2002, Everbridge went public on the Nasdaq in 2016, with its shares peaking at $6.4 billion in 2021 before falling below the $1 billion mark ahead of Thoma Bravo entering the the mix.
The transaction closed in July.
Way back in July 2023, a consortium of buyers led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management announced it was acquiring gamified e-learning platform Kahoot in a deal worth $1.7 billion.
The announcement came a little over two years after Kahoot went public on the Oslo Stock Exchange, with the sale price representing a 53.1% premium on the last trading day before its investors’ specific shareholdings were publicly disclosed in May.
The transaction finally closed in January this year, with Kahoot delisting from the Oslo Børs stock exchange.
Zuora, a platform companies use to manage their subscriptions and billings, is being taken private in a $1.7 billion deal by private equity firms GIC and Silver Lake.
The announcement came a little over four years after Zuora went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), going on to hit a peak mid-pandemic valuation of nearly $3 billion.
The all-cash transaction is expected to close in Q1 2025, subject to the usual shareholder and regulatory conditions.
Model N, a platform that helps companies automate decisions related to pricing, incentives and compliance, went private in a $1.25 billion deal spearheaded by Vista Equity Partners.
Founded in 1999, Model N went public on the NYSE in 2013, though its valuation rarely ventured further north than $1.5 billion — a figure that fell to below $1 billion in the six months leading to Vista Equity Partners stepping into the fray.
The transaction concluded in June 2024, with Model N now a private company."

Today, OpenAI announced that it’s begun previewing a dedicated Windows app for ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot platform.
Currently only available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users, the app is an early version, OpenAI says, arriving ahead of a “full experience” later in the year.
“With the official ChatGPT desktop app, you can chat about files and photos,” OpenAI writes. “This app brings you the newest model improvements from OpenAI, including access to OpenAI o1-preview, our newest and smartest model.”
The ChatGPT app for Windows can run on most Windows 10 machines, but currently has certain limitations compared to other ChatGPT clients. It doesn’t support voice yet, including Advanced Voice Mode, and some integrations with OpenAI’s GPT Store aren’t functional.
As with the ChatGPT app for macOS, the ChatGPT app for Windows lets you minimize it to a small “companion” window alongside other apps while you work. You can upload files and photos to it, have it summarize documents, and create images via OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 image generator.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/waymo-offers-3-credit-for-san-francisco-riders-going-to-public-transit-stations/,Waymo offers $3 credit for San Francisco riders going to public transit stations | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-10-17,"For the next month, Bay Area riders of Waymo robotaxis can earn a $3 credit whenever they travel to and from certain public transit stations.
Riders will be able to take advantage of the offer through November 15, and they can use the credits earned toward future robotaxi rides from now until December 31, the company said.
The pilot program is the first of its kind among autonomous vehicle operators in the U.S. It comes after Waymo found in a recent survey that 36% of San Francisco riders have used Waymo’s robotaxi service, Waymo One, to connect to other forms of transit like BART, Muni, or Caltrain.
Only a handful of stations are valid for the deal, though, mostly in south and southwest SF:
The credits will automatically be added to a rider’s account if they go to or from one of those stations — riders don’t need to prove they actually rode public transit. But for those who are considering racking up points by riding to the stations even when they’re not taking public transportation, the promotion is limited to one $3 credit per day.
Riders often use multiple modes of transportation to get from A to B, so programs like this that connect to public transportation should be more common. But unfortunately, they’re few and far between; even this program is fairly limited.
Shared micromobility is a perfect use case for connecting riders to public transportation. In September, the Seattle Department of Transportation launched a promotion to connect Lime bike and scooter share trips with public transit. That rewards program is funded by a 2016 ballot initiative called the Seattle Transit Measure.
A Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company has not received financial support from the government or transit agencies for this pilot."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/apple-music-latest-feature-lets-artists-create-playlists-for-concerts-tours/,Apple Music’s latest feature lets artists create dedicated playlists for concerts and tours | TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,2024-10-17,"Apple Music introduced a new feature for artists on Thursday to enable them to create playlists tied to their recent concert set lists.
Dubbed “Set List,” the feature acts as a promotional tool for musicians to engage with their fans. It allows artists to turn their set list from a single show, residency, or entire tour into a playlist, which can then be shared with fans on Apple Music and displayed on Shazam’s Artist and Concert pages, as well as posted on social media.
Using the feature is simple. Artists first need to upload an artist image to their profile for the playlist’s cover art. Then, they can choose tracks by typing in search or by pasting Apple Music links. There’s also an option to schedule the publish date, allowing artists to choose a specific time for when they want their fans to listen to the playlist, giving them a way to provide a sneak peek into their live performances. Artists can even rearrange tracks to correspond with their actual show sequence.
Set List is powered by Bandsintown, the music discovery platform where users are notified about tours and bands playing in their area. Artists are required to connect their Apple Music page with Bandsintown to help increase the discoverability of their shows.
Music fans have been showing interest in new types of playlist creation tools, including apps like LineupSupply and Instafest that made playlists from photos of concert or festival posters. Today, the app stores offer more tools that let you build playlists via AI, as well.
The new playlist creation tool is an addition to Apple Music’s Set Lists space, which launched last year to help fans discover upcoming concerts."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/googles-notebooklm-now-lets-you-guide-ai-generated-audio-conversations-launches-business-pilot/,"Google's NotebookLM now lets you guide AI-generated audio conversations, launches business pilot | TechCrunch",Jagmeet Singh,2024-10-17,"Google Thursday updated the audio summarization feature of its AI note-taking and research assistant NotebookLM, which recently gained significant attention for its podcast-like audio conversations based on the content users share, with the ability to guide those conversations and focus on specific topics instead of just generating holistic audio summaries.
Today, audio Overviews in NotebookLM allow users to digest and comprehend the information in lengthy documents or videos through AI-generated audio conversations. Shortly after its launch last month, the feature helped NotebookLM grab eyeballs, as many began sharing audio summaries of their content on social media, including those created using their diaries or journals.
While Google hasn’t disclosed the traction NotebookLM has received as a result, data from the website traffic analytics platform SimilarWeb suggests NotebookLM saw an over 371% increase in its traffic in September to 3.07 million monthly visits, up from 652,181 a month ago.
Until now, Audio Overviews would automatically generate AI conversations from users’ sources. But since conversations sometimes revolve around content that isn’t important, Google is introducing an update that allows you to customize the overviews based on your needs. This lets users make the audio more focused on a particular topic within their content.
A dedicated “Customize” control is available before the existing “Generate” button to let you provide instructions for the AI hosts in the audio to focus on a specific point.
Raiza Martin, NotebookLM’s product leader and a senior product manager for AI at Google Labs, told TechCrunch that the update gives users a way to nudge the AI to move in a direction they want.
“The whole team has been dedicated to listening to and analyzing all of the feedback we’ve gotten. And the number one feature that emerged that people wanted was just to give the AI a little nudge,” she said.
Customizing audio summaries may also help reduce hallucination to some extent, meaning those times the AI cooks up content on its own. Nonetheless, Martin said the NotebookLM team tracks user feedback and tries to catch hallucinations as quickly as possible.
She also emphasized that customizing audio summaries doesn’t mean user instructions would be used to train the AI model.
“In general, we do not train on user data. So, your use of it, or whatever queries you enter, whatever answers you enter, we don’t train the models with it,” she said, adding, “We solicit a lot of feedback from our users.”
Alongside the customization option, users get background listening in Audio Overviews. This allows you to continue working within NotebookLM, query your sources, receive citations, and explore relevant quotes while the audio plays in the background.
NotebookLM was initially launched as a project at Google’s I/O developer conference last year and debuted for public access in the U.S. in December. It expanded to markets including India, the U.K., and more than 200 countries in June. Although the product initially saw some traction within education and research use cases, businesses and organizations only began to try it after Google expanded its support for more sources and added new features.
Now, Google says that more than 80,000 organizations use NotebookLM, which it sees as an opportunity to explore monetization. Hoping to capitalize on this traction, the company on Thursday launched the NotebookLM Business pilot program.
Businesses can apply for the pilot, and if accepted, Google said, they will get early access to product features, training, and email support.
Martin told TechCrunch that under the business pilot, her team trains organizations interested in using NotebookLM as to how other businesses are using it.
“We [also] want businesses to tell us, here are the features we want to deploy,” she said.
General availability and pricing of NotebookLM Business will be announced later this year. However, Google hasn’t yet revealed the exact timeline and any specifics on the pricing tiers.
NotebookLM currently gets 4.17 million monthly visits, with 2.5 million coming from desktops and 1.6 million from mobile devices, per SimilarWeb.
The assistant at present doesn’t have a dedicated mobile app and is available across screens through its website. However, Martin told TechCrunch that the team is actively exploring a native mobile experience to expand NotebookLM’s presence among smartphone users. It’s also exploring more voices, languages, and controls for Audio Overviews.
Further, the team explored and prototyped different numbers of speakers — to go beyond the existing two speakers for AI audio discussions — though it’s not likely to be available soon, as Martin said that it wasn’t the top-requested feature by users.
Last month, NotebookLM added YouTube videos and audio files as sources for generating summaries alongside existing sources such as Google Drive, URLs, PDFs, and text.
Martin said NotebookLM sees PDFs and YouTube videos as the top two sources. The team also observed a “very high percentage” of users who listened to an audio overview and used the chat. The next largest group comprises users who only use the chat without generating an audio overview."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/with-11-9-million-in-funding-dottxt-tells-ai-models-how-to-answer/,"With $11.9 million in funding, Dottxt tells AI models how to answer | TechCrunch",Anna Heim,2024-10-17,"As we’ve reported before, enterprise CIOs are taking generative AI slow. One reason for that is AI doesn’t fit into existing software engineering workflows, because it literally doesn’t speak the same language. For instance, LLMs (aka large language models) require a lot of cajoling to deliver valid JSON.
That’s where a U.S.-based startup called Dottxt comes in, with the promise to “make AI speak computer.” The company is led by the team behind the open source project Outlines, which helps developers get what they need from ChatGPT and other generative AI models without having to resort to crude tactics like injecting emotional blackmail into prompts (“write the code or the kitten gets it!”).
Software libraries such as Outlines, a Python library, or Microsoft’s Guidance, or LMQL (aka Language Model Query Language), make it possible to guide LLMs in a more sophisticated way than mere prompt hacking — using an approach that’s known as structured generation (or sometimes constrained generation).
As the name suggests the focus of the technique is on the output of LLMs, more than the input. Or, in other words, it’s about telling AI models how to answer, says Dottxt CEO Rémi Louf.
The approach “makes it possible to go back to a traditional engineering workflow,” he told TechCrunch. “You refine the grammar until you get it right.”
Dottxt is aiming to build a powerful structured generation solution by being model-agnostic and offering more features — and, it says, better performance — than the open source project (Outlines) it was born out of.
Louf, a Frenchman who holds a PhD and multiple degrees, has a background in Bayesian stats — as do several other members of the Dottxt team. This grounding in probability theory likely opened their eyes to the potential of structured generation. Familiarity with IT beyond AI also played a role in their decision to build a company focused on helping others usefully tap into generative AI.
Louf’s reference to grammar is no accident. Dottxt’s is based on the premise that most of the text we interact with is heavily structured. There’s code, of course, but also many other templates that LLMs should be able to follow to actually be useful in work environments.
GPT-maker OpenAI recently introduced a form of structured generation which it calls Structured Outputs — and it gave a nod to Outlines as part of its “inspiration.”
Louf, meanwhile, sees Outlines’ popularity as a sign that there is demand for another flexible approach with more bells-and-whistles. And investors seem to agree: Dottxt has raised $11.9 million in a matter of months.
The startup pulled in a $3.2 million pre-seed round led by deep tech VC firm Elaia in 2023, followed by an $8.7 million seed led by EQT Ventures this August. In the interval, Louf and his co-founders have been focused on working to prove that their approach doesn’t impact performance. During this time demand for open source Outlines has exploded; they say it’s been downloaded more than 2.5 million times — which has encouraged them to think big.
Raising more funding made sense for another reason: Dottxt’s co-founders now knew they wanted to use the money to hire more people so they could respond to rising demand for structured generation tools. The startup’s fully remote team will reach a headcount of 17 at the end of the month, up from eight people in June, per Louf.
New staffers include two DevRel (developer relations) professionals, which reflects Dottxt’s ecosystem-building priority. “Our goal in the next 18 months is to accelerate adoption, more than the commercial side,” Louf said. Though he also said commercialization is still due to start within the next six months, with a focus on enterprise clients.
This could potentially be a risky approach if the AI hype is over by the time Dottxt seeks more funding. But the startup is convinced there’s substance behind the bubble; its hope is precisely to help enterprises unlock real value from AI.
Hugging Face CTO Julien Chaumond, who is an investor in Dottxt, recently dubbed structured generation “the future of LLMs.” So the hype is reaching down into this segment of the GenAI tech stack too.
With other tailwinds such as AI agents and the rise of smaller AI models, Dottxt’s adoption bet could pay off. “Everyone will be using structured generation in a few years, there is no doubt about that,” Louf predicted."

Porn sites Tukif and Xhamster were among several adult websites subject to the order. The sites have been given 15 days to implement effective age verification or face the block being extended until they do.
Child safety concerns lie behind other recent high-profile interventions on tech platforms — such as the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in France in August under a new cybercrime law. He was subsequently charged in a wide-ranging criminal case sparked by a child sexual abuse material probe.
The European Union also recently designated four adult websites under the strictest layer of the bloc’s online governance framework to push them to use stronger age verification as a child safety measure."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/subscription-management-firm-zuora-agrees-to-be-acquired-for-1-7b/,Subscription management firm Zuora agrees to be acquired for $1.7B | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-17,"Zuora, a company selling software to help businesses manage their subscription-based services, has agreed to be acquired by private equity firms GIC and Silver Lake for $1.7 billion.
The all-cash deal is expected to close in Q1 2025, subject to approvals and customary closing conditions. It’ll take Zuora, which is currently publicly traded, private. Tien Tzuo, Zuora’s CEO and chairman, will continue to lead the company.
“Since our founding, Zuora has evangelized the shift to the subscription economy and evolution to complex revenue models, providing technology necessary to monetize products and services,” Tzuo said in a press release. “As a private company, with the support and expertise of Silver Lake and GIC, our monetization suite will continue to lead in the marketplace.”
Tzuo, along with K.V. Rao and Cheng Zou, founded Redwood City, California-based Zuora in 2007.  Rao and Zou were engineers at WebEx, while Tzuo was chief strategy and marketing officer at Salesforce.
The idea behind Zuora was a platform for orchestrating businesses’ various billing systems, with an emphasis on subscription management. Over the past decade, Zuora has slowly expanded its offerings through mergers and acquisitions, purchasing subscription invoicing and billing startup Frontleaf, subscription experience platform Zephr, and revenue recognition software provider Leeyo.
Today, Zuora offers tools to help companies keep track of subscription payments, pricing, and accounting, and a marketplace of apps built on top of Zuora’s services. Most recently, Zuora launched a product to automate the process of reconciling and analyzing revenue while enabling firms to measure the impact of their subscription businesses.
Before going public in 2018, Zuora raised $250 million in venture capital from investors including Benchmark, Greylock, and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff. In August, the ~1,500-employee company’s market cap was hovering around $1.39 billion.
In its most recent fiscal quarter (Q2 2025), Zuora beat expectations, reporting adjusted earnings per share of 19 cents, up from seven cents in Q2 2024, on revenue of $115.4 million, up 7% year-over-year.
“Zuora’s best-in-class software powers the revenue engines for many of the largest and most exciting companies today,” said Choo Yong Cheen, chief investment officer of private equity at GIC, and Eric Wilmes, head of private equity, Americas at GIC, said in a joint statement. “With rapid growth in the subscription economy, company requirements are becoming increasingly complex. Having established the category, Zuora’s products and experience position it for continued market leadership.”
Zuora’s acquisition comes on the heels of another major take-private PE deal. This morning, Permira completed its acquisition of Squarespace after upping its bid to $7.2 billion.
PE mega-deals have surged this year, on track to challenge the 22-year record set in 2021. In Q2, PE firms announced 122 deals worth $196 billion, making it the strongest period for PE capital deployment since the downturn began in Q3 2022, according to EY."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/hackers-are-extorting-globe-life-with-stolen-customer-data/,Hackers are extorting Globe Life with stolen customer data | TechCrunch,Carly Page,2024-10-17,"Insurance giant Globe Life, which provides life and health insurance policies to millions of Americans, says it is being extorted by a hacker that has stolen customers’ sensitive data.
In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, the Texas-based conglomerate said it has “recently received communications” from an unknown threat actor who is seeking to extort money from the company in exchange for not disclosing data stolen from its systems.
The compromised data, which Globe Life has traced back to its American Income Life Insurance Company subsidiary (AIL), includes personally identifiable information, such as customer names, postal addresses, and phone numbers. In “some cases,” the data also includes Social Security numbers, health-related data and other policy information, according to the company’s filing.
Globe Life says that approximately 5,000 individuals are known to be affected by the data breach so far, but concedes that the “total number of potentially impacted persons or the full scope of information possessed by the threat actor has not been fully verified,” suggesting that the number of affected individuals is likely to be far higher. Globe Life says it has more than 17 million policies in force, while AIL has at least two million policyholders at its last public count.
According to Globe Life’s filing, the hacker responsible for the breach “claims to possess additional categories of information, which claims remain under investigation and have not been verified,” but states that the compromised information does not appear to contain financial information such as credit card data or banking information.
The cybersecurity incident appears to be an extortion-only attack, with Globe Life saying the incident did not involve the use of file-encrypting ransomware.
In the case of Globe Life, the organization notes that the threat actor has also shared “information about a limited number of individuals to short sellers and plaintiffs’ attorneys,” likely in a bid to pressure the company into paying its extortion demands.
The hackers’ demands are not yet known, and Globe Life spokesperson Jennifer Haworth declined to answer TechCrunch’s questions.
Globe Life says it has reported the incident to federal law enforcement."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/apple-says-support-for-redeeming-rewards-will-later-come-to-apple-pay/,Apple says support for redeeming rewards with more partners is coming to Apple Pay | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-10-17,"On Thursday, Apple celebrated 10 years with Apple Pay and announced how the service will evolve in the future, including features like redeeming rewards and expanding installment loan options. In addition to Apple Pay’s newly added support for loan options from Affirm in the U.S., and Monzo Flex in the U.K., the iPhone maker shared that starting today, support for Klarna will go live in the two countries, including both at checkout online and in-app with Apple Pay.
Further down the road, the company says it will expand access to installment loan options to include those from eligible credit or debit cards, including those from Citi and Synchrony in the U.S. and other participating issuers with Fiserv. Outside the U.S., these options will also include ANZ in Australia, DBS in Singapore, CaixaBank in Spain, and, in the U.K., HSBC, NewDay, and Zilch — some of which had been announced previously.
Klarna will be rolled out to Canada at some point in the future, as well, the company said.
These installment loan options follow Apple’s surprising decision to roll back its plans for Apple Pay Later, its own “buy now, pay later” service. In June, Apple said it was killing the option that had first launched in late March 2023. Instead, Apple said it would work in partnerships with Apple Pay-enabled banks and lenders to offer this service. The decision allows Apple to ensure banking partners stay connected with Apple Pay, as it becomes a new source for installment loans, instead of seeing Apple compete with them directly.
In an announcement on Apple’s newsroom, Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, suggested that the addition of loan providers was only the start of further changes for Apple’s payment service and Wallet. She noted the company would give consumers “the option to redeem rewards,” which Apple Pay-enabled issuers and lenders could use to better connect with their customers. The company took a step in this direction with the launch of iOS 18 and eligible Discover credit cards, but Apple tells us it has more partners on the way.
More broadly, she said the company’s larger goal with Apple Wallet is to replace users’ physical wallets entirely, something it’s been working on with the app’s support for things like event tickets, transit cards, keys, and government IDs. However, the adoption of digital IDs today varies by state, with California, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, and Ohio now supporting digital driver’s licenses and state IDs, while others only have support on the roadmap, or not at all.
Apple also shared some stats about Apple Pay’s adoption after its 10-year history, noting it’s now used by hundreds of millions of consumers across 78 markets, on millions of websites and apps, and in tens of millions of stores worldwide. More than 11,000 bank and network partners support the payment technology, too.
Updated to clarify rewards are available with select Discover cards but more partners are coming."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/uk-digital-end-of-life-services-startup-farewill-acquired-for-16-8m/,UK digital 'end-of-life' services startup Farewill acquired for $16.8M | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-17,"Farewill, a U.K.-based end-of-life services provider that offers online tools for writing wills, organizing probate, and arranging cremation, has been acquired by funeral service provider Dignity in an all-shares deal valuing the startup at £12.9 million ($16.8 million).
The deal is a classic case of an established legacy incumbent chasing growth by buying a younger digital upstart, and is designed to help Dignity gain a larger portion of a death care services market that’s expected to reach $190 billion by the end of the decade.
Founded in 2015, Farewill is one of several startups to emerge in a category dubbed “death tech.” This includes apps to memorialize loved ones and social platforms to support the grieving process. Some have raised significant amounts of venture capital funding, too, such as Empathy, which emerged from stealth back in 2021 with $13 million for its digital assistant for bereaved families — going on to raise a further $47 million just a few months ago.
Farewill, for its part, has raised around $39 million since its inception, from backers including Augmentum Fintech, Highland Europe, Keen Venture Partners, Kindred Capital, and Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus. This means that Farewill’s $16.8 million valuation is well below the capital that had been injected — a fire sale by just about any estimation.
It’s not clear what the exact circumstances were that led to this sale — reports emerged back in February that one its investors, the VC arm for Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), had cut its stake’s estimated value by two-thirds, suggesting that Farewill’s valuation had dropped from £86 million to £30 million. Today’s news is worse than that.
Farewill’s most recent accounts showed an increase in gross sales (+31.4%), revenue (+36%), and gross profit (+88.9%) for financial year 2023. However, its EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) figure showed that the company still wasn’t operationally profitable, with losses of £4.2 million — though those losses had fallen by half on the previous year.
Add to all that, the transaction is being financed through a share-for-share exchange. Farewill’s shareholders will now own stock in Castelnau Group — an investment firm and Dignity’s majority shareholder, after a joint venture with serial entrepreneur Sir Peter Woods’ SPWOne took Dignity private in a $349 million deal last year.
“The addition of Farewill to Dignity’s offering embodies Castelnau’s strategic ambitions for Dignity, helping Dignity to drive its digital transformation and serve its customers even better,” Castelnau CEO Richard Brown said in a statement.
Dignity’s origins can be traced back more than 200 years, though its current incarnation is the result of various mergers and acquisitions. However, with a digital-native rival under its wing it will be hoping to be able to combine collective strengths. Dignity operates more than 40 crematoria in the U.K. and has a strong on-the-ground presence, while Farewill’s online-focused services looks like a complement to that — “combining the strength of Dignity’s heritage, with Farewill’s expertise in online journeys and data,” as they put it in a press release.
The Farewill brand will continue as is, and will operate independently.
“At Farewill, our mission has always been to make the end-of-life experience as straightforward and stress-free as possible,” Farewill co-founder and CEO Dan Garrett (pictured above with Dignity CEO Zillah Byng-Thorne) said in a statement. “Joining forces with Dignity allows us to stay true to that mission while benefiting from the experience and resources of a company that has been a trusted name for generations.”
The acquisition is still subject to regulatory approval, and isn’t expected to close before January 1, 2025."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/hyperspectral-imagery-startup-wyvern-looks-to-raise-us-presence-with-6m-raise/,Hyperspectral imagery startup Wyvern looks to raise US presence with $6M raise | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-17,"Canadian remote sensing startup Wyvern is expanding south of the border.
The Alberta-based company, which collects what it says is the highest-resolution hyperspectral imagery on the market, has raised $6 million to, among other things, expand into U.S. commercial and defense markets.
The new funding was led by Squadra Ventures, a firm squarely focused on investing in companies in the cyber and national security spaces. Wyvern has already established an American subsidiary, and co-founder Kurtis Broda told TechCrunch that working with Squadra was a “natural fit” for growing in that market.
“As a Canadian company, we need to enter the U.S. market. We need to access key defense programs and bid on those sorts of programs of record,” he said. (Co-founder Kristen Cote added, however, that “We are proud to be Canadian.”)
American defense agencies, chiefly the National Reconnaissance Office, have awarded contracts to a slew of hyperspectral imaging companies. While these study contracts are a preliminary step, they will likely lead to bigger, more lucrative opportunities as the spy agency looks to further expand its remote sensing capabilities.
Wyvern, which was founded around six years ago and graduated from Y Combinator’s Winter 2022 cohort, has three satellites in its Dragonette constellation, built by satellite manufacturer AAC Clyde Space. Those collect hyperspectral imagery across 23 or 32 bands (depending on the satellite), in 5.3-meter resolution. Next year, the company will launch two more satellites as part of a previously announced partnership with Loft Orbital. It doesn’t sound like that much of an increase, but Cote said the downlink capacity increase from the small buses built by Clyde to the much larger Loft buses will be substantial.
“We just had our start of commercial operations in April,” she explained. “We’re resource constrained at the moment. People want all this data, but we don’t have enough capacity on orbit right now. With Loft it’s about increasing the downlink capacity and the overall global coverage.”
Hyperspectral imaging uses a special camera to capture radiation outside the visible light spectrum. Using a form of analysis called spectrometry, the system can identify different materials and objects by what wavelengths they reflect.
Companies can use hyperspectral data for everything from identifying tree species to catching methane leaks. Wyvern’s constellation captures light in the near-infrared spectrum, and much of the company’s commercial focus has been on agriculture and forestry monitoring. One goal with the funding is to develop a next-gen system that can capture even more wavelengths, Cote said.
The round also includes participation from previous investors Uncork Capital and Y Combinator, and new investment from the University of Alberta Innovation Fund, Accelerate Fund III, and Brent Perrot."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/from-elon-musk-to-cop-car-chases-how-a-software-engineer-launched-a-police-ai-startup/,"From Elon Musk to cop car chases, how a software engineer launched a police AI startup | TechCrunch",Margaux MacColl,2024-10-17,"Earlier this year, Abel founder Daniel Francis was in a car going 135 miles per hour down a highway in Oakland, California. The driver, a police officer, had a gun in his lap.
Francis has made a habit of riding shotgun with policemen in the name of research for his company, which creates AI to fill out police reports. Usually, the rides are fairly uneventful. But that day, the officer had pulled over a man to search his car. The man freaked out and pressed the gas pedal, almost hitting someone. Francis and the officer took off chasing him. “I was so excited,” Francis recalled. “I was like, finally, it’s happening! Finally, not just a stolen car call where we go and fill out a report.”
After 40 minutes — and a dicey last act through the narrow Oakland Hills streets — the man’s car sputtered to a stop, out of gas. The officer was visibly sweating; Francis’s heart was pounding. But between near-missing parked cars and swerving down the highway, Francis had time to think about AI. Specifically, how would AI write up a police report for a car chase? “That’s one of the hardest reports to write,” he said. “When you write a pursuit report, you have to list out every side street that you went by and every turn you took. Those reports are massive.”
In his 20 police ride-alongs, Francis has spent a lot of time thinking about how AI can help cut down on police paperwork. His company, Abel, creates AI that uses body cam footage and dispatch call data to fill out normally time-consuming police reports. On Thursday, he announced that Abel has raised a $5 million seed round led by Day One Ventures with participation from Long Journey Ventures and backing from Y Combinator as part of the summer 2024 class. Francis will use the funding to hire engineers and continue improving Abel’s AI.
You might recognize Francis’ name: When Elon Musk was laying off thousands of Twitter employees in 2023, Francis playfully pretended online to be a disgruntled Twitter engineer — which led to him actually getting hired as a Twitter engineer. (By the way, Francis said it’s way more stressful working for Musk than sitting shotgun in a car chase. “If Elon yells at you, it’s terrifying,” he laughed.)
Francis’ pivot from social media into police tech was prompted by a series of unfortunate events. In 2022, Francis helped a close friend escape an abusive marriage, secretly relocating her and her child to a new home in the dead of night. “It was the most heart-pounding thing I’ve done, maybe in years,” Francis recalled. “Under the cover of darkness, help my friend escape and drive away.”
But then her husband found her new address. “He would come over, banging on the door, yelling threats,” he said. “This happened a few times, and each time, it took about 45 minutes for the Oakland Police Department to get there.”
Francis was struck by how long it took the police to arrive. He interviewed police officers, many of whom told him how catastrophically understaffed their departments were. He also learned that a police report can take 45 minutes to write, causing police to spend about one third of their time writing reports or other documentation. “This number changed my life,” Francis said. “That’s an insane use of time.”
He became obsessed with how new AI models could cut down the time spent writing reports. He made the initial Abel demo with homemade body cam footage, roleplaying petty crimes like littering with his friends. “I’ve made enough demo videos now that I know every petty crime that won’t involve bystanders,” he said.
Now Abel is being used by the police department in Richmond, California (and Francis has access to real body cam footage). He said police officers there have changed their work schedules around Abel: instead of pulling to the side of the road to spend 40 minutes on a report, they can save them until the end of the day and simply edit the first draft that Abel has already prepared.
Abel is not the only one working on AI police reports. Competitors range from Axon (makers of tasers and body cams) with its Draft One product to tiny startups like Policereports.ai.
Francis hopes that Abel will ease paperwork chores for cops. “It’s much better for everyone if the cops are not overworked, if the cops are not burning out,” he said. “If they can actually show up and do the job that they signed up to do.”

Manifest isn’t quite a unicorn yet — it’s only in its seed stage, having just raised $3.4 million from a16z Speedrun and a number of other investors. But Wu sees her company as part of a new crop of products trying to mitigate a rise in loneliness.
Wu is in her late twenties, right on the cusp of the murky boundary between millennials and Gen Z, but she understands the struggles of the younger generation. A report from Cigna found that three out of five adults report that they sometimes or always feel lonely; that number is even higher among respondents aged 18-22, at 73%. Manifest is the app she wishes she had when she was an undergraduate at Stanford, navigating a competitive, intimidating environment while living on her own for the first time.
“I really felt like the real world punched me in the face,” Wu told TechCrunch. “I feel like school teaches you all these things around, here’s how to get a job at Facebook, or Google, or Microsoft, or Goldman Sachs, but it doesn’t teach you how to go build your own emotional toolkit.”
When you open the Manifest app, you’ll see a pastel gradient orb in the center of the screen. You can hold the button to talk, or tap it to type, in response to a number of prompts: “What’s on your mind?,” “What are you worried about?,” or “What would be useful for us to talk about?”
Then, the app’s AI will mirror your language and turn it into an affirmation, which you can turn into a personalized audio meditation.
For example, if you tell the app that you’re finding it hard to be proud of yourself after running a 5K because you got last place in your age group (totally not pulling from personal experience…!), it will spit out a couple of affirmations, like, “I strive to appreciate my progress, no matter how small,” or, “I trust that my commitment to this process will lead to growth in both my physical and mental health.”
Maybe those words of AI-generated wisdom help. Maybe they don’t. But Manifest isn’t meant to be an end-all-be-all mental health solution or a replacement for actual mental health treatment. Instead, Manifest is designed to be something that you can use for a few minutes every day to feel just a little bit more grounded.
“We are a wellness app that’s really kind of designed to meet Gen Z where they’re already at,” Wu said. “The real core thesis behind Manifest was like, can we make these bite-sized interactions with wellness super easy and super delightful, where it doesn’t feel like a chore to go do Manifest?”
In a time when young people are overwhelmed by the constant noise of social media, it may seem counterintuitive to use technology — let alone something that can feel as impersonal and amorphous as AI — to address loneliness. But Wu thinks that if Gen Z is already sucked into their phones, then wellness needs to happen there, too.
“Gen Z is hanging out way less in person,” she said. “So it’s like, what do you give a generation that we’ve already done this to? Like, the idea that you tell that person to go outside and hang with their friend is an astronomical leap for them, so how do you go and give them something where they’re already at?”
Manifest launched in stealth this summer, and so far, users have generated 18.7 million “manifestations” in the app.
As with any app of its nature, Manifest has to navigate the ethical challenges around making a consumer mental health product with no medical backing. Wu said that there are safeguards embedded in Manifest’s AI, such as redirecting users to a suicide hotline if they mention self-harm. There are some topics like this that Manifest will decline to engage with.
From a risk standpoint, this could be a smart move for Manifest — it’s dangerous to leverage an experimental AI as a tool to help with something as serious as preventing self-harm. But other startups battling loneliness, like chatbot company Nomi AI, take a different approach. When Nomi AI users open up about thoughts of self-harm, the AI companions won’t halt the conversation — instead, they will try to de-escalate the situation by talking the user through their feelings.
Alex Cardinell, the founder of Nomi AI, argues that just stopping a conversation and providing a suicide hotline number could be alienating to someone who’s struggling for connection.
“I want to make those users feel heard in whatever their dark moment is, because that’s how you get someone to open up, how you get someone to reconsider their way of thinking,” Cardinell told TechCrunch in a recent conversation. “I really want to look at what’s aligned with the user, rather than what’s aligned with the strictest attorney’s loss mitigation strategy.”
Wu doesn’t think that Manifest, or any consumer app, is where people should go if they are in a situation where they need legitimate medical help. But young people are turning to these tools when seeking real medical care isn’t accessible. So, if Wu is right about the impending unicorn startups that will combat the loneliness epidemic, those companies — and Manifest — will need to tread thoughtfully.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/eclipse-opens-an-nyc-office-with-plans-to-bolster-its-presence-on-the-east-coast/,Eclipse opens an NYC office with plans to bolster its presence on the East Coast | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-10-17,"After nearly a decade, industrials-focused VC Eclipse expanded out of Silicon Valley. The firm opened its second office in New York’s Soho neighborhood, with plans to invest more on the East Coast.
Eclipse backs startups in sectors including manufacturing, supply chain, healthcare, and infrastructure, among others, both through its early-stage and early growth-focused funds. Since the firm’s founding in 2015, it has been exclusively located in Silicon Valley — until now.
Kaitlyn Glancy, a New York-based partner that joined Eclipse in 2023 after eight years at Flexport, told TechCrunch that the timing was right for the firm to formally expand to New York.
Glancy said that the pandemic made a lot of people “wake up” to the issues in legacy industries like supply chain and transportation. She added that since then there has been a noticeable rise in companies looking to fix these industries’ woes and these startups are increasingly popping up on the East Coast.
“If you look at like the deep industrial ecosystem of New York, and the broader Northeast, there’s a strong industrial history,” Glancy said. “When I’m meeting with founders, they’re kind of pulling on that. They’re pulling on some interesting family history. They’re also pulling on interesting current events. Supply chains are broken, transportation systems are broken. There’s a lot of opportunity here.”
This office also allows the firm to set up a local hub for the companies it has already backed in New York and beyond on the East Coast. Eclipse has already invested in a handful of East Coast startups.
New York-based Augury is one. Eclipse backed the machine health diagnostic company in August 2015; it was last valued at $1 billion in 2021. Reframe Systems is another. Reframe is based in Andover, Massachusetts and built a microfactory to produce small sustainable homes.
Glancy added that there are other secondary benefits to setting up camp in New York too. This office puts them closer to many of their LPs and also gives them easier access to Washington, D.C., which is increasingly important, she said, as the firm has gotten more into defense tech investing.
“We’re seeing founders, and we’re seeing success in our existing portfolio companies in this industrial space, so let’s go double down,” Glancy said. “If we have a team that’s based here, we should be able to go and find more founders that are playing in this ecosystem and help really be the center of gravity.”
Eclipse isn’t the only firm that is looking to put more emphasis on investing in the New York tech scene this year. Index Ventures just recently told TechCrunch they were looking to add multiple new people to their New York office. Index did just lose Paris Heymann, one of the firm’s founding partners in New York, this month.
New York startups raised $5.6 billion across 406 deals in Q3 of 2024, according to PitchBook data. While this figure represents a dip from Q2, $7.1 billion was invested across 420 deals, it still cements New York as the second largest startup ecosystem in the U.S. and shows that San Francisco is not the only place to build a successful company despite what some Bay Area VCs think.
For now, Eclipse’s New York office will house Glancy and Ashwin Pushpala, an Eclipse venture partner, in addition to room for portfolio company founders. Eclipse is currently investing out of its fifth early-stage fund, $720 million, and second early growth fund, $510 million. Glancy said the firm is looking to put that capital to work and is actively seeking new companies in New York and all around the East Coast.
“We want everybody who’s playing in that industrial space to be working with us, having conversations with us, or building around us,” Glancy said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/permira-completes-squarespace-acquisition-after-upping-bid-to-7-2b/,Permira completes Squarespace acquisition after upping bid to $7.2B | TechCrunch,Paul Sawers,2024-10-17,"Website builder Squarespace is no longer a publicly traded company, after private equity firm Permira procured all remaining common stock in the firm.
Permira first revealed plans to acquire Squarespace back in May, offering shareholders in the NYSE-traded company $44 per share — this equated to an equity valuation of $6.6 billion, and an enterprise valuation of $6.9 billion. However, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended that Squarespace shareholders reject the offer on the basis that the transaction didn’t maximize value — particularly given that Squarespace’s financial outlook was strong.
As a result, Permira upped its offer last month — to $46.50 per share, representing a valuation of around $7.2 billion. On Monday, Permira announced that it had successfully bought most of the shares and would be completing a second-step merger to acquire all outstanding shares from remaining shareholders who didn’t participate in the tender offer — and that step is now complete.
On Tuesday, Squarespace also completed the sale of its restaurant reservation service Tock to American Express, in a deal valued at $400 million.
Founded in 2004 by Anthony Casalena, Squarespace is a no-code platform for SMEs and freelancers to build websites, blogs, and online stores. The company filed to go public in 2021, hitting a peak market cap of $8 billion — well below its peak private valuation of $10 billion. However, the company’s market cap plummeted to $2 billion in 2022, before soaring back up past the $5 billion mark off the back of strong earnings.
Permira’s bid represents a 36.4% premium over Squarespace’s three-month average price leading up to the transaction announcement in May, and it’s also one of the biggest take-private deals of 2024.
Casalena will continue as Squarespace’s CEO and chairman, and Permira says that he has “rolled over a substantial majority” of his Squarespace equity rather than cashing it all out — meaning he remains one of his company’s biggest shareholders. VC firms Accel and General Atlantic also remain as what Casalena calls “meaningful investors” post-acquisition."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/indias-central-bank-orders-sachin-bansals-navi-to-halt-loans/,India's central bank orders Sachin Bansal's Navi to halt loans | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-10-17,"India’s central bank ordered four non-bank lenders, including Navi Finserv and DMI Finance, to halt loans from October 21, citing excessive interest rates and regulatory breaches.
The Reserve Bank of India said (PDF) the firms violated rules on pricing, income assessment, and asset classification. This action follows months of warnings about responsible lending practices, it added. The affected companies can continue servicing existing customers but must implement remedial measures to resume new lending.
Many startups and large tech firms, including Google, Samsung, and Airtel, work with DMI Finance to extend loans to their customers.
The news is also the latest setback for Navi, a Bengaluru-based startup founded by Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal. The central bank earlier rejected Navi’s application for a banking license.
The new order comes at a time when Navi has been in talks with investors to raise its maiden external funding, TechCrunch earlier reported.
“Navi Finserv Limited is committed to conducting its business operations with the highest standards of compliance, customer service, and transparency,” a Navi spokesperson said in a statement. “The company is reviewing the directions received from the Hon’ble Reserve Bank of India and will work with them, and address all the concerns raised with promptness and completeness.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/elon-musks-x-boosts-dsa-info-for-eu-users-as-blocs-probe-of-its-complaint-handling-continues/,Elon Musk's X boosts DSA info for EU users as bloc's probe of its complaint handling continues | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-17,"An incoming privacy policy update to Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) will see the company making it clearer to users in the European Union that they have the right to appeal decisions under the bloc’s Digital Services Act (DSA), such as account bans, content takedowns and shadowbanning.
The online governance regulation, which applies on scores of services and platforms operating across the bloc, carries stiff penalties for breaches — of up to 6% of global annual turnover, so there’s high regulatory risk for anyone flouting the rules.
In a summary of DSA-related changes that X said will take effect on November 15, 2024 alongside other ToS and privacy policy updates, the company wrote: “[I]f you are a recipient of the X service in the European Union, we’ve updated our ‘Summary of Terms’ to help you understand you may challenge certain decisions we make under the Digital Services Act (Regulation (EU) 2022/2065) via our internal process or out-of-court dispute settlement as described here.”
X’s note links to a page with further information about EU users’ decision appeals rights — including the company stipulating that users “are entitled to select any out-of-court dispute settlement body certified by the Digital Services Coordinator in the relevant Member State of the EU to resolve a dispute relating to any such decision.”
The DSA requires that in-scope services engage with certified bodies to arbitrate disputes “in good faith” when a user requests they do so. Although the law does not make these bodies’ decisions binding on regulated services, as X’s user memo also notes.
X’s DSA info page also flags up a link to a web form hosted within its Help Center where EU users can submit appeals about illegal content decisions directly to X.
The social media platform has already been successfully sued over shadowbanning by an individual based in the Netherlands (PhD candidate at Leiden University, Danny Mekić) — whose DSA complaints included not being notified of the account restrictions applied to him; not being given a statement of reasons why X had limited his account visibility; and not being provided with a point of contact to appeal its decisions.
But while Mekić prevailed on these complaints in court in the Netherlands in July — and on a separate data-related complaint brought against X under the bloc’s privacy framework, the GDPR — wider DSA enforcement has yet to bite on X.
The European Commission does have multiple open investigations against Musk’s company, though. And its first bundle of DSA probes on X, announced back in December 2023, include scrutiny of its policies and practices around illegal content notices and complaint handling. So X’s privacy policy updates in this area are likely to be related to all this enforcement activity.
The EU went on to lay out an initial set of DSA grievances on X this summer. The first three suspected breaches don’t concern the decision appeal issue — but it’s likely the bloc will have more grievances to present in the coming weeks/months as it works through its other investigations.
Reached for comment on X’s latest updates, Mekić pointed out the company still has a legal obligation to notify EU users who are affected by actions like shadowbanning — as he was.
“I’m happy to see that Twitter [X] finally started to take steps to comply with the DSA and gives the many users they shadowban the possibility to appeal. However, before people can appeal, they need to be aware of any limitations of the visibility of their information, such as a specific message or their (full) profile,” he told TechCrunch.
“I hope Twitter will also start complying with the DSA in the sense that they need to proactively inform users of such limitations, as is required under Article 17 DSA, so that users are actually aware of the measure they want to appeal to — and that the European regulators will strictly enforce this obligation that Twitter so far, also according to the Amsterdam District Court, has been failing to comply with.”
X was contacted with questions about its policy changes but at the time of writing the company had not responded.
We have also contacted the Commission for a progress update on its DSA investigations of X — the first of which was opened almost exactly 10 months ago.
Update: Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier confirmed the bloc is still investigating X’s notice and complaints procedures. In total he said the company is suspected of five breaches of the DSA (three of which are at the preliminary finding stage, as noted above). In those more advanced probes X has the right to defend itself to settle the EU’s grievances; or, if the Commission confirms the breach findings, the EU could reach a non-compliance decision — meaning enforcement on X would follow.
“There is no precise timeline for [the EU completing all its DSA probes of X], and the Commission continues its investigation on the two remaining suspected breaches, namely illegal content and information manipulation more generally,” he added."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/casio-says-no-prospect-of-recovery-yet-after-ransomware-attack/,Casio says 'no prospect of recovery yet' after ransomware attack  | TechCrunch,Carly Page,2024-10-17,"Japanese electronics giant Casio has confirmed that many of its systems remain unusable almost two weeks after it was hit by a ransomware attack.
Casio spokesperson Ayuko Hara told TechCrunch on Thursday that the company sees “no prospect of recovery yet” as it struggles to bounce back from the cyberattack.
“Since October 5, our servers experienced a system failure that rendered several of them unusable,” Hara told TechCrunch, adding that the company subsequently took measures to disconnect its servers to prevent the spread of damage.
“This countermeasure is affecting our receiving and placing orders with suppliers and schedule of product shipments,” Hara said. “There is no prospect of recovery yet, but we are prioritizing our customers as we move forward with recovery.”
These shipping issues appear to be affecting customers only in Japan, TechCrunch has learned, where customers are met with a prompt that states: “Due to a problem with our product shipping system, the shipping date is currently undecided.” Casio’s U.S. website appears unaffected at the time of publication.
On Friday, Casio revealed it had been the victim of a ransomware attack, which saw attackers compromise sensitive company data and the personal information of employees, contractors, business partners, and job applicants. This data theft was claimed by the Underground ransomware group, which shared alleged samples of the stolen Casio data on its dark web leak site.
Hara tells TechCrunch that the “hackers left a threatening message indicating their intention to leak our data,” but said that Casio had not received a ransom demand. This suggests the company has not made contact with the ransomware group, but Casio would not comment when asked by TechCrunch.
Casio has not yet determined which types of data were stolen or how many individuals are potentially affected, Hara said.
“We have identified that certain information have [sic] been compromised, details are still under investigation,” Hara said. “But we are sure no credit card information of our customers has been compromised.”
Underground, which security experts have linked to the Russia-linked cybercriminal group known as RomCom (or Storm-0978), claims to have stolen more than 200 gigabytes of data from Casio’s systems. Security researchers have linked the RomCom group to cyberattacks carried out on behalf of the Russian state.
When asked whether Casio disputes Underground’s claims, Hara said the company is “currently investigating.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/instagram-rolls-out-new-safety-features-to-protect-teens-from-sextortion/,Instagram rolls out new safety features to protect teens from sextortion | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-17,"Instagram is introducing a series of new safety features to protect users from sextortion scammers, the company announced on Thursday. Most notably, the company is no longer going to allow people to screenshot or screen record ephemeral images or videos sent in private messages.
Up until now, you have been able to screenshot ephemeral content in Instagram DMs (direct messages), but the other person would be notified that you saved it. With this change, if you send someone a photo or video via DMs using the “view once” or “allow replay” features, the other person won’t be able to save the content. Plus, Instagram won’t let people open “view once” or “allow replay” images or videos on the desktop to ensure that they can’t circumvent the safety measures.
By preventing users from taking screenshots of ephemeral content, Instagram is taking things a step further than Snapchat when it comes to making sure ephemeral content remains that way. On Snapchat, if you send someone an image, they are allowed to screenshot it. While Snapchat does notify the user that their image was saved, the app doesn’t do anything to prevent users from taking screenshots of ephemeral content in the first place.
Instagram, on the other hand, is now ensuring that content meant to be viewed once can, in fact, only be viewed once.
The Meta-owned social network says the new features announced today complement the recent launch of Teen Accounts, which automatically enroll young users into an app experience with built-in protections that limit who can contact them.
With Teen Accounts, young users can’t receive messages from anyone they don’t follow or aren’t connected to, but they can still receive follow requests from anyone. Now, Instagram is making it harder for suspicious accounts, like those that were recently created, to request to follow teens.
Depending on how scammy an account appears, Instagram will either block the follow request entirely or send it to a teen’s spam folder.
The app is also rolling out safety notices in DMs to let teens know when they’re talking to someone who might live in a different country. The company says it’s doing so because sextortion scammers often lie about where they live in order to get teens to trust them.
Since sextortion scammers often use a teen’s following and follower lists to try to blackmail them, Instagram is going to prevent accounts depicting scammy behavior from seeing people’s following and follower lists. These accounts also won’t be able to see who has liked someone’s post or see which photos they have been tagged in.
In addition, Instagram is fully rolling out its nudity protection feature globally after first testing it starting in April. The safety measure automatically blurs images that contain nudity in DMs. The feature will be enabled by default for teen users. As for the people sending them, Instagram will warn them of the risks involved with sending private photos.
To provide more support within its app, Instagram is partnering with Crisis Text Line in the U.S. Now, when a user reports an issue related to child safety or sextortion, they will see an option to talk to a crisis counselor.
The changes come 10 months after Instagram, alongside other major social networks, was grilled by lawmakers for not doing enough to protect young users on its platform.
As part of its efforts to fight sextortion, Instagram is going to start showing an educational video about sextortion scammers to teens in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada. The social network is also partnering with influencers like Bella Poarch and Brent Rivera to create content about spotting sextortion and what to do if it happens."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/cyera-acquires-trail-security-for-162m-cyera-is-now-raising-at-a-3b-valuation/,Cyera acquires Trail Security for $162M; Cyera is now raising at a $3B valuation | TechCrunch,Ingrid Lunden,2024-10-17,"Cyera, the Israel-founded, U.S.-based cybersecurity unicorn that uses artificial intelligence to build what’s known as data security posture management — a full assessment and picture of where a customers’ data has been created, where it is stored, and how it is used — has been on a growth tear in the last year, picking up business as breaches have continued to hit a growing number of enterprises and other large organizations. Now Cyera is taking the next steps in its expansion with its first acquisition and a major fundraise on the horizon.
The startup is acquiring Trail Security, a startup that was still in stealth mode building solutions for data loss prevention — essentially technology complementary to posture management to help secure data in the event of a breach. Cyera is paying $162 million for Trail in a mix of cash and shares, Cyera’s CEO and co-founder Yotam Segev told TechCrunch in an interview.
Cyera has been building up an impressive list of customers across major industries like healthcare, communications and financial services (they declined to name names, but notably one of their investors is AT&T), so there is revenue coming in. It also still has some money in the bank from previous fundraises. Most recently, Cyera picked up a $300 million Series C at a $1.4 billion valuation in April 2024.
But it will soon be getting more. We have also confirmed, with sources close to the matter, that Cyera is in the process of raising at least $200 million at a pre-money valuation of around $3 billion.
The deal will help Cyera bulk up its offerings to meet demands from customers to handle the longer process that comes after posture management engagement, namely also to offer a more complete suite of services compared to others in the field. Competitors to Cyera include CrowdStrike, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, Rubrik, Wiz, and Zscaler.
Trail is a relatively young company — it was just one year old and still operating in stealth mode, as you can see by its sparse website and the fact that Zohar Vittenberg, the CEO and co-founder, hadn’t even had a chance to make the company “LinkedIn official.” But in fact, it had quietly already raised $35 million in funding, Segev told me, including a Series A from Lightspeed, CRV, and Cyberstarts — the early-stage backer that’s invested in a whole wave of big-name Israeli cybersecurity companies, including Cyera and Wiz.
The startup had some momentum, so why throw in the towel so fast? Wittenberg told me it was for two main reasons.
First, it’s the state of the security market, where buyers are currently favoring platform plays — with “all in one” offerings over point solutions.
“We think we’re building the best product in the category, but I think the customers wanted to buy data loss protection and data security posture management (DSPM) as one platform,” Vittenberg said in an interview. “We can leverage the DSPM side and build it better.”
The second reason is that Segev and Wittenberg have known each other for years, going back to school, and it felt like an easy choice to make for both sides when it came to a culture fit.
Cyera’s focus going forward will be to continue enhancing its own technology — AI might be the startup’s own instrument of choice for gathering and protecting data, but it’s also the weapon of choice a lot of malicious hackers are using to figure out innovative ways to breach networks — but it’s also going to be making more acquisitions, Segev told TechCrunch, to address growing demands from customers to do more.
“You have no idea how many times a month I get a phone call from a CISO asking delicately for some time,” Segev told me back in April. “‘I’ve got something going on,’ they say. ‘I need you. How fast can you guys scan my environment?’ It happens every time. And what we do is, we jump on it. We send a squad, we have them figure out what data was in scope. They sometimes don’t even know what data was breached.”
Trail has 40 employees and all of them are joining Cyera."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/zepto-eyes-100m-from-indian-offices-in-third-funding-in-6-months/,Zepto eyes $100M from Indian offices in third funding in 6 months | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-10-17,"Zepto is in advanced stages of talks to raise $100 million in new investment, its third in the last six months, as the leading Indian quick-commerce startup looks to rope in more domestic investors, sources familiar with the talks told TechCrunch.
The Mumbai-headquartered startup, which delivers grocery items and office stationery to customers’ doorsteps in 10 minutes in multiple Indian cities, is raising the new investment from Indian family offices and high-net-worth individuals.
Motilal Oswal, the asset management giant that earlier invested $40 million in Zepto, is running the mandate for the new funding deliberation, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. The financial services firm has already received commitments for more than half of the allocation, according to another source familiar with the situation.
The new investment values Zepto at a $5 billion post-money valuation, the same value at which it recently closed a $340 million financing round in August. Zepto has raised more than $1 billion in the last six months and all of it remains in its bank.
Zepto is planning to go public next year, and the new fundraise is aimed at expanding the base of domestic investors on its cap table. Zepto counts Avra, Lightspeed, Nexus, StepStone Group, YC Continuity, Glade Brook, and Contrary among its backers.
Even as quick-commerce startups are retreating, consolidating, or shutting down in many parts of the world, the model is showing encouraging signs in India. Quick-commerce startups are on track to do a sale of more than $6 billion this year, according to TechCrunch’s analysis.
In response to the fast rise of quick commerce, which is increasingly shaping the consumer behavior in India, many e-commerce incumbents — including Flipkart, Myntra, and Nykaa have been forced to scramble to find ways to lower the time they take to deliver items to their customers.
Shares of DMart, which runs one of the largest brick-and-mortar retail chains in India, fell this week after the firm confirmed that it was losing some business to quick-commerce startups.
“We believe Quick Commerce players are expanding cities, categories, SKUs, AOVs and discounts, and creating parallel commerce for convenience-seeking customers,” analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note this week.
Zepto — which competes with Zomato-owned Blinkit, Prosus-backed Swiggy’s Instamart, and Tata’s BigBasket — has grown its annualized net run rate considerably in recent months, according to sources and an internal document reviewed by TechCrunch.
Zepto co-founder and chief executive Aadit Palicha told a group of investors in August that the startup projects to grow at 150% in the next 12 months, TechCrunch earlier reported."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/accel-eyes-stake-in-truemeds-at-330-million-valuation/,Accel eyes stake in India's Truemeds at $330M valuation | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-10-17,"According to half a dozen sources, Accel, the global venture firm, is in advanced discussions to lead a funding round of $30 million to $40 million in Truemeds, an Indian online pharmacy that’s focused on providing customers with more affordable generic alternatives to costly branded medications.
The talks are currently centered on a proposed valuation of about $330 million for the 6-year-old, Mumbai-headquartered startup, per these same sources, who requested anonymity as the deliberations are ongoing and private.
The deal hasn’t finalized, so it may still not materialize or the terms can change, the sources cautioned. Accel and Truemeds didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The potential round for Truemeds comes amid a period of consolidation and upheaval in the online pharmacy industry. PharmEasy, backed by Prosus Ventures, has seen its valuation plummet from a peak of $5.6 billion to below $600 million after struggling to repay a loan to Goldman Sachs.
Janus Henderson, the British American global asset firm, implied a valuation of about $458 million for PharmEasy at the end of June, according to its most recent mutual fund disclosures. In 2021, Tata Digital acquired 1mg, another major player in the space.
Unlike its competitors, Truemeds is taking a slightly different approach. The startup aims to disrupt the supply chain of how medicine reaches customers, eliminating middlemen that inflate the final price. After customers upload their prescriptions, Truemeds doctors recommend generics with the same active ingredients, produced by Indian manufacturers. This service aims to reduce medication costs, particularly for those with chronic conditions requiring ongoing treatment.
The platform operates entirely online, with consultations, ordering, and delivery all handled digitally. This eliminates the need for patients to visit physical pharmacies and allows Truemeds to reach customers in remote areas.
If the new funding materializes, it would more than double Truemeds’ valuation, which was $132 million in an extended Series B round last year. The startup originally raised the Series B funding from investors, including WestBridge Capital and Info Edge Ventures at a valuation of $76.7 million, according to Tracxn, a venture insight platform."

In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.”
Employees working on Reality Labs, Instagram, and WhatsApp were affected by the layoffs, according to The Verge.
One of the employees affected by Wednesday’s layoff is Jane Manchun Wong, a software engineer who was hired to join Instagram in 2023 after becoming known for revealing unannounced features coming to Meta apps. At the time, her appointment was celebrated by Meta’s CTO, Andrew Bosworth, and the head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri.
Other former Meta employees also took to social media to announce they were laid off. Employees who previously worked on Facebook, recruiting, legal operations, and design said they had been laid off on Wednesday in social media posts viewed by TechCrunch.
A Meta spokesperson tells TechCrunch that Threads, recruiting, and legal operations were not impacted by the reorganization and there were no layoffs there. Meta declined to comment on the record about how many employees were affected and what orgs they were part of.
One former Meta employee, who worked in one of these organizations, tells TechCrunch that some employees were offered different positions under new contracts or told they could take a severance package instead. Several took the severance package, according to the source.
The former employee tells TechCrunch that more than a dozen people on their team were notified that their roles were affected via video calls on Wednesday. Some employees affected on Wednesday received six weeks of severance pay, according to the former Meta employee. (The employee spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive matter.)
In addition, mirroring a rumor circulating on the workplace app Blind, the Financial Times reported that some employees were fired for using their $25 meal credits to buy non-food items, like household needs.
In recent years, Meta has laid off a large amount of its workforce to rightsize the company following aggressive pandemic hiring. In 2022, Meta laid off roughly 13% of its workforce, or 11,000 employees, for which CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally took responsibility. In 2023, Meta laid off another 10,000 employees and withdrew 5,000 open roles it had yet to fill.
Correction: A previous version of this story suggested that Threads, recruiting, and legal operations were part of Meta’s reorganization on Wednesday. Meta reached out to clarify that these organizations were not part of the reorganization."

Some AI labs would have you believe they are, but according to Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, the answer is no. He thinks we could get there in a decade or so, however, by pursuing a new method called a “world model.”
Earlier this year, OpenAI released a new feature it calls “memory” that allows ChatGPT to “remember” your conversations. The startup’s latest generation of models, o1, displays the word “thinking” while generating an output, and OpenAI says the same models are capable of “complex reasoning.”
That all sounds like we’re pretty close to artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, during a recent talk at the Hudson Forum, LeCun undercut AI optimists, such as xAI founder Elon Musk and Google DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg, who suggest human-level AI is just around the corner.
“We need machines that understand the world; [machines] that can remember things, that have intuition, have common sense, things that can reason and plan to the same level as humans,” said LeCun during the talk. “Despite what you might have heard from some of the most enthusiastic people, current AI systems are not capable of any of this.”
LeCun says today’s large language models (LLMs), like those that power ChatGPT and Meta AI, are far from “human-level AI.” Humanity could be “years to decades” away from achieving such a thing, he later said. (That doesn’t stop his boss, Mark Zuckerberg, from asking him when AGI will happen, though.)
The reason why is straightforward: Those LLMs work by predicting the next token (usually a few letters or a short word), and today’s image/video models are predicting the next pixel. In other words, language models are one-dimensional predictors, and AI image/video models are two-dimensional predictors. These models have become quite good at predicting in their respective dimensions, but they don’t really understand the three-dimensional world.
Because of this, modern AI systems cannot do simple tasks that most humans can. LeCun notes how humans learn to clear a dinner table by the age of 10 and drive a car by 17 — and learn both in a matter of hours. But even the world’s most advanced AI systems today, built on thousands or millions of hours of data, can’t reliably operate in the physical world.
In order to achieve more complex tasks, LeCun suggests we need to build three-dimensional models that can perceive the world around you and center around a new type of AI architecture: world models.
“A world model is your mental model of how the world behaves,” he explained. “You can imagine a sequence of actions you might take, and your world model will allow you to predict what the effect of the sequence of action will be on the world.”
Consider the “world model” in your own head. For example, imagine looking at a messy bedroom and wanting to make it clean. You can imagine how picking up all the clothes and putting them away would do the trick. You don’t need to try multiple methods, or learn how to clean a room first. Your brain observes the three-dimensional space and creates an action plan to achieve your goal on the first try. That action plan is the secret sauce that AI world models promise.
Part of the benefit here is that world models can take in significantly more data than LLMs. That also makes them computationally intensive, which is why cloud providers are racing to partner with AI companies.
World models are the big idea that several AI labs are now chasing, and the term is quickly becoming the next buzzword to attract venture funding. A group of highly regarded AI researchers, including Fei-Fei Li and Justin Johnson, just raised $230 million for their startup, World Labs. The “godmother of AI” and her team is also convinced world models will unlock significantly smarter AI systems. OpenAI also describes its unreleased Sora video generator as a world model but hasn’t gotten into specifics.
In a 2022 paper on “objective-driven AI,” LeCun outlined an idea for using world models to create human-level AI, though he notes the concept is over 60 years old. In short, a base representation of the world (such as video of a dirty room) and memory are fed into an world model. Then the world model predicts what the world will look like based on that information. Then you give the world model objectives, including an altered state of the world you’d like to achieve (such as a clean room) and guardrails to ensure the model doesn’t harm humans to achieve an objective (don’t kill me in the process of cleaning my room, please). Then the world model finds an action sequence to achieve these objectives.
Meta’s long-term AI research lab, FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), is actively working toward building objective-driven AI and world models, according to LeCun. FAIR used to work on AI for Meta’s upcoming products, but LeCun says the lab has shifted in recent years to focusing purely on long-term AI research. LeCun says FAIR doesn’t even use LLMs these days.
World models are an intriguing idea, but LeCun says we haven’t made much progress on bringing these systems to reality. There’s a lot of very hard problems to get from where we are today, and he says it’s certainly more complicated than we think.
“It’s going to take years before we can get everything here to work, if not a decade,” said LeCun. “Mark Zuckerberg keeps asking me how long it’s going to take.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/this-startups-diamond-chips-help-remove-radioactive-debris-at-stricken-daiichi-nuclear-power-plant/,ODD taps $27M for diamond chips to clear radioactive debris at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant | TechCrunch,Kate Park,2024-10-17,"Back in 2011, the world held its breath after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan suffered a failure of its cooling systems, in the wake of the country getting hit by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami. The worry was not unfounded: The resulting meltdown — which spread highly radioactive material in multiple directions — became one of the worst nuclear-related disasters of all time.
More than a decade on, the cleanup is still in progress. Last month, the Japanese government began a testing procedure to remove radioactive debris in and around the plant — a significant step in the plant’s decommissioning process, expected to be completed by 2051.
A groundbreaking startup from Japan, Ookuma Diamond Device (ODD), is playing a fascinating part in the process, by way of diamond-chip-powered amplifiers that are being used in efforts to remove radioactive debris. And now it has raised 4 billion yen, equivalent to approximately $27 million, to build the world’s first diamond semiconductor manufacturing facility in nearby Ookuma, also in Fukushima.
ODD’s plans are to build the factory in January 2025 and have it up and running by summer 2026.
Why use diamond chips rather than traditional silicon-based semiconductors?
Diamond is known as a wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductor material; others include SiC (silicon carbide) and GaN (gallium nitride). WBG materials are considered to have better power conversion efficiency and exceptional thermal management.
Unlike silicon-based CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs, the diamond-based chip does not have a circuit structure. Diamond semiconductors act more like powerful control devices than small electricity sources, Coral Capital partner Ken Nishimura told TechCrunch. He said that the diamond semiconductor will be used in larger facilities such as nuclear power plants that require super high temperatures and radiation levels, which silicon-based chips cannot withstand.
Diamond semiconductor amplifiers operating under 300°C have been successfully prototyped using the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and Hokkaido University facilities.
“Diamond semiconductors, which we develop, are fundamentally different from traditional silicon-based chips due to their superior material properties,” Yuhei Nagai, CFO of Ookuma Diamond Device, said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. Compared to other advanced semiconductors like SiC and GaN, diamond semiconductors provide superior power conversion efficiency and improved thermal management for next-generation technologies such as 6G, space, defense, and nuclear, he continued.
It’s also notable that diamond chips can be made from methane gas, potentially enabling full production in Japan. This is in contrast to GaN, which relies on sourcing materials heavily controlled by China.
ODD’s focus is on developing “pure diamond semiconductors,” rather than GaN semiconductors on a diamond substrate, Nagai said. The market size for diamond materials used in chips is expected to grow to $10 billion by 2032, up from $113.7 million in 2023, according to a recent report.
The startup, a spinout from Japan’s AIST and Hokkaido University, was specifically founded in 2021 to help with decommissioning the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.
Two co-founders, Dr. Junichi Kaneko and Dr. Hitoshi Umezawa, have researched diamond chips for over 20 years. They found their work thrown into the spotlight after the disaster, which spelled more resources for R&D and spurred the founding of the startup. ODD built the world’s first practical diamond chip in 2021.
The leaps between theory, chip, and final product are still significant. The two co-founders are also leading the Japanese government’s wider national project to make an actual product that could remove radioactive debris from natural disasters.
“The [ODD’s] prototypes represent a world-first achievement — no one else has been able to develop functioning diamond semiconductor amplifiers to this point,” said Nagai.
A handful of global companies are also developing diamond semiconductors, including Diamfab in France, Element Six in the U.K., and A.L.M.T. in Japan, a subsidiary of Sumitomo Electric Industries.
ODD sets itself apart by claiming to be the only one with end-to-end expertise, from substrate to packaging, enabling the world’s prototype of a diamond semiconductor amplifier.
ODD is also talking with more than 10 potential customers worldwide in the nuclear power plant, aerospace, and telco industries, Nagai said — an area that this week got increased focus after it emerged that Google signed a deal to work on powering data centers with nuclear power.
Globis Capital Partners led the recent funding, which brings its total raised to approximately $45 million (6.7 billion yen) since its inception, with participation from Coral Capital, aSTART, Green Co-Invest Investment, Japan Post Bank Spiral Regional Innovation Fund, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Venture Capital, SMBC Venture Capital, among others.
The startup, which currently has 27 employees, has also received around $15 million in government grants from the Cabinet Office, METI, MIC, ATLA, and the Reconstruction Agency."

That’s according to Bloomberg, which reports that Apple was collaborating with BYD Co., a Shenzhen-based car company, to develop batteries using lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells. Apple contributed engineering expertise, specifically in areas like heat management and advanced battery packs, while BYD supplied its manufacturing resources and proprietary LFP technologies.
The battery was intended to be safer than most EV batteries at the time, per Bloomberg, and longer range.
Apple canned its plans for a car back in February after reportedly spending roughly $1 billion a year on the project since 2014. While it ultimately didn’t come to fruition, the effort wasn’t a total failure; according to Bloomberg, battery insights gleaned from the car project helped other Apple teams with the development of the Vision Pro and Neural Engine chip."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/the-analogue-3d-drags-the-fondly-remembered-n64-into-the-21st-century/,The Analogue 3D drags the fondly remembered N64 into the 21st century | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-16,"Who among us (and by “us” I mean elder millennials) does not remember the glory days of GoldenEye deathmatches after school? It’s one experience that has been difficult to reproduce despite the march of technology — but retro gaming hardware outfit Analogue’s latest, a ground-up re-creation of the N64 called the 3D, will likely be the best possible way to do so. Hey, don’t pick Oddjob!
Analogue has previously taken on the 16-bit era with FPGA-based re-creations of the SNES, Sega Genesis, PC Engine, and Gameboy Advance; the N64, however, represents a new level of complexity and power, especially when the goal is not just to replicate but to exceed its capabilities.
As one of the first 3D-focused consoles, the N64 was powerful for its time, but also, of course, quite limited. And while there have been a number of ways to play these games via emulators, the system has been plagued by compatibility issues and other quirks. Even Nintendo’s first-party emulation of N64 games has fallen short in various ways.
Analogue, as is its habit, spent years meticulously re-engineering the N64 in FPGA form — basically, this means that the new 3D console is, in several important ways, indistinguishable from the original hardware. One hundred percent compatibility with the console’s game library is the most obvious one, meaning every single N64 cartridge works with this thing.
Perhaps the bigger challenge with the N64, as with many other consoles of that era, is how it produces an image. The N64 put out an analog video signal intended for display on interlaced CRT displays — something that directly influenced the gameplay and art styles of countless games for the platform. Many retro games simply look bad on modern high-resolution displays not because they are dated or the art is insufficient, but because the display techs are fundamentally different.
To that end, Analogue has built in a native upscaler that, rather than cleaning up and digitizing the analog video output of the original system (as some upscalers do, with varying degrees of success), produces a natively digital, 4K signal with imitation CRT artifacts and scanlines. This is something they pioneered early on and produced several versions of to reproduce accurate phosphors and display modes for the multi-system Analogue Pocket. I’ve asked for more details on this and will update the post if I hear back from the company.
The result is simply that games ought to look how you remembered them, which is to say probably a sight better than they actually looked. Still, temper your expectations: The Analogue 3D doesn’t improve the N64’s low frame rate (20-30 FPS usually, or less) or the “true” resolution of the game; it just renders it better than it probably ever has been rendered outside someone’s enthusiast retro-gaming setup. (The MiSTer/PVM community goes crazy on this stuff.)
To further improve the original N64 experience, the Analogue 3D supports up to four new wireless 8bitdo controllers after the style of the original, but without their familiar but, let us admit, ridiculous three-pronged nature. Those controllers did not age well — the official remakes are better but still clunky. (You’ll have to buy these separately.)
The 3D does not support OpenFPGA, the multi-system platform found on the Pocket (and darling of the emulation crowd), but it does have an SD card slot, so you will likely be able to play ROMs if such is your choice.
Though I haven’t yet tried it, I feel sure that the Analogue 3D will prove to be one of the best, if not the best, way to play N64 games the way they were intended to be played. Anyone seeking deeper improvements, like better frame rates and high-quality texture maps, can of course stick to the quite advanced emulation scene.
You can preorder the Analogue 3D in black or white for $250 starting on the morning of October 21. I’ll see you in Facility — License to Kill, pistols only, and no Oddjob."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/ororatechs-space-based-wildfire-detection-brings-in-25m-to-put-more-imaging-satellites-in-orbit/,OroraTech's space-based wildfire detection brings in $25M to put more imaging satellites in orbit | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-16,"Wildfires aren’t going away, but our ability to detect and track them — and maybe catch them early enough to prevent serious damage — is getting better. OroraTech is taking a space-based approach to “wildfire intelligence” and just raised $25 million to grow its market and cover more of Earth.
The German startup currently has two thermal-infrared imaging satellites in orbit, watching over a number of locations around the world and some 160 million hectares of forestland.
OroraTech first used data from dozens of other imaging satellites and terrestrial sources but now relies on its own and is planning on having an initial constellation of eight up and running by mid-2025.
The idea, as you might expect, is to offer near-real-time monitoring of lands where wildfires are a risk. The company recently landed a €20 million ESA contract to keep an eye on Greece’s forests, for instance, and they’re watching properties and lands in North America and the Pacific as well.
The more data they collect, the better their service can be — it’s a big part of many imaging and space plays that a unique, high-quality dataset can be worth as much as the service itself. Especially when heavy hitters like Google are getting involved.
This €25 million (about $27 million) Series B round was led by Korys, the European Circular Bioeconomy Fund, and Bayern Kapital, with participation by Edaphone Private Impact Fund, Ananda Impact Ventures, ConActivity KG, and Findus Venture. The cash infusion should let the company keep building out its sensor network and training up its predictive AI systems; expect to hear about their next satellite, FOREST-3, going up in early 2025."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/spacex-sues-california-agency-alleging-political-bias-against-musk-and-regulatory-overreach/,"SpaceX sues California agency, alleging political bias against Musk and regulatory overreach | TechCrunch",Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-16,"SpaceX has filed a lawsuit against a California agency this week after the body rejected a proposal to increase the company’s launches from the state’s coastline to 50 per year.
The California Coastal Commission (CCC) made its decision at an October 10 meeting, despite the U.S. Air Force (USAF) endorsing the plan on the grounds that more launches of Starlink and Starshield, the defense-focused unit, are critical to national security.
In the lawsuit, SpaceX says that the commission engaged in “naked political discrimination” when some commissioners cited the political activity of CEO Elon Musk, while also attempting to unlawfully regulate federal agency activities. The CCC declined to comment for this story. SpaceX did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.
The first part of the complaint has gotten most of the headlines, and SpaceX will need to prove in court that the commission’s decision was substantially influenced by Musk’s politics. But the second part is arguably more substantial: What is the final legal authority over launch activities on a defense base, and do those activities count as federal or private when conducted by a commercial entity on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD)?
SpaceX and the USAF say that launch cadence at Vandenberg Space Force base is a “federal agency activity” because of the capabilities of Starlink and the company’s launches of other national security payloads, even though Starlink is also a commercial product.
Under this interpretation, the USAF would simply need to submit a certification stating that the proposed launches are consistent with state policy.
But the commission rejected this characterization of SpaceX launches, given that the company also launches commercial payloads and sells Starlink to the general public, with the agency arguing that increased launches would require the company to apply for a “coastal development permit” (CDP) with the CCC.
Staff at the commission recommended that the commissioners concur with the USAF. They argued that the Air Force had committed to implementing protective measures against sonic booms and pointed out a lack of evidence that increasing launches from 36 to 50 annually would have adverse environmental effects. The commission will have another opportunity to consider launch increases soon; it is expected that SpaceX and the USAF will look to increase launches again, to 100 per year.
Commissioners were far from unanimous in their rejection of SpaceX’s plan — the final vote was 6-4 against — and most cited their view that the launches were primarily a private, not federal, activity and as such required a CDP. But it is true that some commissioners specifically pointed to Musk’s political activity.
“We’re linking the private and the public,” Commissioner Mike Wilson said. “This company is owned by the richest person in the world with direct control of what could be the most extensive communications system on the planet. Just last week that person was speaking about political retribution on a national stage,” he said, referring to Musk’s appearance at a presidential rally for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. “We’re talking about the promotion of this technology and a human being that has so much power over that, and I just want to acknowledge that.”
SpaceX lawsuit also quoted a statement from commissioner Gretchen Newsom, who described how Musk has been “hopping about the country, spewing and tweeting political falsehoods and attacking FEMA while claiming his desire to help the hurricane victims with free Starlink access to the internet.”
She went on to applaud the USAF’s willingness to adopt additional environmental protective measures but said these should be footed by SpaceX: “These items should be the duty and burden of SpaceX, not the military and taxpayers undertaking these oversights to the benefit of SpaceX,” she said.
The dispute raises an important point about the difference between federal and private activity, especially as the U.S. government across civil and defense agencies increasingly procures services from private companies rather than buying or owning the equipment themselves (e.g., rather than the DoD owning and operating a satellite communications network for national security and the intelligence community, it purchases capacity from SpaceX).
SpaceX obviously believes that its commercial launches are federal agency activities, legally speaking. The company is asking the Central District of California court to find the commission’s rejection of the plan unlawful."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/y-combinator-backed-fintech-capway-has-shut-down/,Y Combinator-backed fintech CapWay has shut down | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-10-16,"CapWay, a Y Combinator-backed fintech that sought to bring financial services to those in so-called banking deserts, has been shut down, according to its founder Sheena Allen.
Allen wrote about it on LinkedIn and confirmed to TechCrunch.
“I am proud of the work we were able to accomplish, but honestly disappointed that we couldn’t complete the mission,” she wrote. “I feel strongly that there is still much work to be done in the financial inclusion space, so it won’t be the last you hear of me in regard to fighting for economic equality.”
Allen told TechCrunch the company started to wind down last year and waited this long to announce after a possible acquisition fell through.
Banking deserts are people in communities, often rural, that have no nearby physical bank branch to obtain a checking account. The term is also extended to people who have difficulty going to a bank, such as lower-income, older, or disabled individuals.
Allen (pictured above) launched CapWay in 2016 after realizing the impact that not having a bank account has on some communities, such as depending on high-interest payday loans or high-fee cash-checking services, as CNN reported.
CapWay’s company planned to address this population by teaching financial literacy and offering online banking solutions. PitchBook shows the company raised just under $800,000 in funding from investors, including Backstage Capital, Fearless Fund, and Khosla Ventures. It was part of YC’s Summer 2020 cohort, as TechCrunch reported at the time.
Allen told us there were a few reasons why she shut the company down. She cited the fact that the fintech industry took a huge reputational hit after the hacking of Evolve Bank & Trust and the collapse of Synapse, the latter of which saw hundreds of millions of dollars of consumer funds frozen.
After that, many banks that looked to partner with fintechs required the fintech to have a certain amount of money in the bank.
“It takes money to play in a highly regulated industry because you can’t control the changes,” Allen said. “You just have to have enough money and time to survive the adjustments.”
CapWay had to find a new banking partner during this time but needed to raise more money to meet potential partners’ money-on-hand requirements, which it struggled to do. Some investors turned her away by citing that the company lagged too far behind its competitor.
But she also pointed out the challenge that has pained many Black founders this past year.
“Fundraising itself was down for everyone, but it was and is extremely down for Black founders,” she said. Crunchbase found that Black founders raised only 0.3% of the $79 billion that went to U.S.-based startups in the first half of the year.
Allen often felt like she was in competition with other Black-founded fintechs for that smaller piece of pie. She wrote in her post that some investors turned her down by telling her that they had already invested in another Black-founded debit card fintech.
“Some investors like to group all Black fintech companies into one box, [even] when we don’t all do or operate the same or have the same target audience,” she told us. “It’s unfortunate, but that was a factor in us being told no a few times.”
Allen thanked her team and some of her investors in her LinkedIn post, pointing out that there were investors who “still called and not only checked on the business and me as a founder but me as a human.” She also thanked her fellow founders who “listened to me rant and called to simply check on my mental state through this process.”
But one failed startup — which is almost a badge of honor in the startup world — has not deterred her from her love of building companies. She still wants to work in the financial inclusion space and is pondering her next startup idea. She’s currently looking at some potential entrepreneur-in-resident opportunities at venture firms.
“It’s a rough time to wind down your company,” she said. “But I’ve learned there’s beauty in the journey even on cloudy days when things seem dark.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/after-selling-drift-ex-hubspot-exec-launches-ai-for-customer-success-managers/,"After selling Drift, ex-HubSpot exec launches AI for customer success managers | TechCrunch",Marina Temkin,2024-10-16,"Elias Torres has achieved a lot for somebody who immigrated to the U.S. from Nicaragua at 17 without knowing any English. He served as a VP of engineering at HubSpot before co-founding Drift, a company that sold to Vista Equity for about $1.2 billion in 2021.
“It’s very rare to get this far, but I’m not done,” Torres told TechCrunch.
About a year ago, Torres (pictured above) founded Agency AI, an AI-powered startup designed to automate tasks traditionally handled by customer success managers (CSMs). These professionals provide personalized support to users of complex B2B software, ranging from onboarding and training to upselling new features.
On Wednesday, Agency is coming out of stealth and announcing that it raised a $12 million seed round led by Sequoia and HubSpot Ventures.
The idea for Agency was born when Torres started consulting for OpenAI in early 2023. The ChatGPT maker asked Torres for help developing AI solutions for some of its enterprise customers, including the NBA and Live Nation. In the course of doing that, it occurred to Torres that companies could benefit from AI customer success managers.
He was encouraged to build a startup around this concept when he met with Brian Halligan, co-founder and executive chairman of HubSpot. “We worked together on the CRM at HubSpot, and he told me, ‘Let’s build something great together again,’” Torres said about his conversation with Halligan. (Halligan joined Agency’s board.)
Shortly after meeting with Halligan, Torres reached out to Sequoia partner Pat Grady, who had previously invested in Drift. Grady was instantly sold on the idea.
“It’s hard to hire great CSMs. It’s hard to scale great CSMs,” Grady told TechCrunch. “If you have a product that can do a lot of the work on their behalf, and you can scale your company without having to hire an army of CSMs. That’s pretty useful.”
Agency can free up time in the customer success manager’s workday by handling tasks such as scheduling, follow-ups, note-taking, customer onboarding, and meeting preparation.
Torres explained that Agency’s AI gains a deep understanding of each customer from emails, CRM data, chat messages, and phone conversations, which allows it to anticipate customer needs at any point.
“This is something that we’ve been dreaming about for a long time,” he said, adding that this was the goal of Salesforce, the CRM he helped build at HubSpot and Drift, which was building personalized conversations for salespeople. “We didn’t have the technology to do this until now.”
The company’s product is currently being tested with companies, including HeyGen, and is available in an invite-only beta for customer success professionals.
While Agency seems to have no direct competitors at present, another function within the sales and marketing organization, sales development representative, is facing disruption from dozens of AI-powered solutions.
“I don’t know anybody else going after this market,” Sequoia’s Grady said. “Hopefully people won’t discover that for a while, and they’ll have a little bit of room to run.”

Launched last year, the online portal lets businesses manage their presence across Apple’s 1.5 billion devices in areas like Maps, Siri, Spotlight search, Safari, and Wallet. Now business owners will be able to integrate their branding into other Apple products as well, including Mail, Tap to Pay on iPhone, and the Apple Phone app. In addition, Business Connect will open up to all types of businesses, not just those with a physical location, the company says.
Business Connect evolved out of a simpler system that had allowed businesses to manage their listings on Apple Maps, called Apple Business Register. Since the arrival of Business Connect in early 2023, “millions” of places around the world have begun to use the service to customize how their business appears to consumers. This involves the use of place cards, cover photos, logos, business photos, limited-time promotions and incentives known as “Showcases,” and action buttons for things like “order pickup,” or “view menu,” for example.
Businesses can also tap into insights to find out more about how consumers are interacting with their business, including how users came to find the business and what actions they take once on the business’s place card.
With today’s expansion, Apple will make it possible for any type of business to establish a profile on the system, including businesses that provide services, operate from a home, or businesses that are fully online without a physical location.
In addition, all businesses will be able to further manage their brand’s presence across more Apple apps and features.
Through the dashboard, businesses can enter details about their brand, including things like the name, category, logo, and website, and can preview how their place card will appear to consumers.
Later this year, this information will also be used to customize how business emails will display in Apple’s Mail app. Instead of the boring gray logo that appears today, the email can display the brand’s name and logo in the inbox. And, when clicking into an email, the brand will have an even larger presence with a colorful header at the top of the screen derived from the brand’s logo, in addition to the business’s name and logo.
This Branded Mail feature arrives alongside the newly redesigned Mail app for iOS 18, which now categorizes email and groups mail by sender. Similar to Gmail, iOS 18 will sort email into tabs, like Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. Apple says it won’t rely on whether a business has set up its brand through Business Connect to determine where the mail gets sorted, however.
Brands will undergo a review process after submitting their brand information, Apple says. They’ll also be able to manage multiple emails or branded domains — like marketing emails versus order confirmation emails. Brands can sign up for this option today and their logo will begin displaying to customers later this year.
Tap to Pay is another area that will now feature the brand’s icon instead of the now generic category icon displayed today. The business’s name will also be customizable so it appears to customers the way the business wants it to during the payment process. With this change, Apple says customers will know when they’re making a payment to a trusted and verified business.
While not arriving until next year, the integration with the Phone app may be the most useful, as it will identify calls by featuring the business name, logo, and department, helping consumers better determine which calls may be unwanted or spam.
Apple says the features, which include a revamped Business Connect dashboard with contextually aware topics and tips,   will become available to “most” businesses worldwide by signing up for Business Connect with an Apple account. They can also manage their location presence at scale through listing management agencies like DAC Group, Rio SEO, SOCi, Uberall, and Yext.
“We’re excited to offer all businesses — including those without a physical location — the ability to create a brand that appears across the Apple apps that over a billion people use every day,” said David Dorn, Apple’s senior director of Internet Software and Services Product, in a statement. “We designed Business Connect to empower businesses to present the best, most accurate information to Apple users. With today’s updates, we’re helping even more businesses reach customers, build trust, and grow,” he added."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/fisker-owners-get-help-with-recall-repairs-as-court-approves-liquidation-plan/,Fisker owners get help with recall repairs as court approves liquidation plan | TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,2024-10-16,"Fisker’s plan to liquidate its assets has been accepted by the bankruptcy court in Delaware. And with it, the issue of who should pay for labor costs associated with a pair of recalls on the bankrupt EV startup’s SUVs is finally settled.
Fisker has also reached a deal with American Lease, the buyer of its remaining EV fleet, to resolve a problem regarding the cloud-hosted data that is required to operate the vehicles.
The court’s acceptance of the plan brings the four-month process of Fisker’s bankruptcy mostly to a close. And it gives a green light to a newly appointed trustee to oversee the sale of around $1 billion in assets, including the manufacturing equipment that was used to build Fisker’s electric SUVs. The plan also lays out all the details about how much money Fisker’s myriad creditors will receive from the sale of those assets.
But the plan also wraps up loose ends, including the issue of who will pay for the labor costs associated with two recalls. Fisker actually has five outstanding recalls on its Ocean SUVs. Three can be resolved with a software update, but two of them require replacement parts.
Fisker initially said it would cover the cost of the parts but not the labor when it published an FAQ about the recalls in mid-September. It quickly reversed course and said it would cover the labor costs. But then it reversed again in late September, putting the financial burden back on the owners.
The Department of Justice said last week that this approach was illegal, because it violated the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. So Fisker and its bankruptcy lawyers had to devise a new approach as it worked to finish off its liquidation plan.
Now, any owner getting the two recalls addressed before the liquidation plan is considered to be in effect — which should be this week — will still have to pay up front for labor costs. They will then have to submit a reimbursement claim to the trustee overseeing Fisker’s liquidation. Anyone who has already paid for the labor to fix these recalls also falls into this bucket.
Anyone who gets the recalls fixed after the plan’s effective date can go to an authorized service center and get the repairs done without paying for labor. Those service centers will then have to make their own reimbursement claims with the liquidation trustee.
Fisker has also resolved a surprising last-minute issue with American Lease, the New York-based leasing company that bought the startup’s remaining fleet of around 3,000 Ocean SUVs for $46.25 million. American Lease filed an emergency objection to the liquidation plan last week because, it said, Fisker had discovered it was unable to move data crucial to operating its EVs onto a new server.
American Lease agreed to pay an additional $2.5 million over the next five years to take control of the cloud services that keep the Ocean SUVs online. Additionally, the Fisker Owners Association will get access to this data, along with other support services that will help existing owners in the years to come."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/gm-partners-with-startup-forge-nano-to-improve-ev-battery-life-performance-and-safety/,"GM partners with startup Forge Nano to improve EV battery life, performance, and safety | TechCrunch",Rebecca Bellan,2024-10-16,"General Motors is working with Forge Nano, a materials science startup, to find new ways to enhance the performance and lifetime of electric vehicle battery cells.
The automaker’s investment arm, GM Ventures, on Wednesday injected $10 million into Forge Nano, which is developing a thin coating the startup says will help improve safety and increase the lifetime of cathode-active materials, reducing overall battery costs.
As part of the strategic investment, GM and Forge Nano also signed an agreement that will potentially see the automaker using the startup’s coating, an “atomic layer deposition technology” called Atomic Armor.
In a lithium-ion battery, the cathode is the side that stores the lithium ions when the battery is charged and releases them when discharged. The other electrode in a battery cell, the anode, takes in the lithium ions when the battery is charging and releases them during use. The most common combination of cathode materials is lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt, but lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are gaining ground with GM and other automakers like Tesla and Ford.
The partnership and investment comes as GM drops its Ultium battery branding and moves away from a “single cell, single chemistry, single form factor strategy to more of a multi-cell, multi-supplier, multi-chemistry, multi-form factor strategy for our battery roadmap,” Jack Crawley, a GM spokesperson, told TechCrunch.
GM’s EV sales grew 60% year-over-year in the third quarter, but that growth isn’t reaching the pace the company and investors had hoped for. EVs still make up only 4.9% of GM’s total third-quarter sales, and CEO Mary Barra decreased 2024 guidance to 200,000 EVs sold.
GM Ventures always invests in startups with an eye toward potential strategic partnerships to improve its own products. In the electrification and battery space, GM Ventures has invested $167 million in 18 portfolio companies, including startups like Soelect, Mitra Chem, and SolidEnergy Systems.
“GM is always looking for ways we can make EVs more effective [and] pursue better battery performance,” Crawley said. “So atomic layer deposition — the ability to control our chemistry and structure of our battery materials at the atom-by-atom level — is certainly something we’re interested in.”
Crawley noted that this technology could lead to faster charging rates, increased energy density, and longer lived batteries.
Paul Lichty, Forge Nano’s CEO, added that the Atomic Armor platform increases the safety of cells by helping to prevent things like thermal runway events, which can lead to battery fires.
That’s because Atomic Armor is made of an ultra-thin ceramic layer to coat materials down to the atomic particle level, leading to more stable and robust performance, according to Lichty.
Battery cell materials today are typically manufactured with coatings, but Lichty says those aren’t uniform and they’re not at the atomic level.
“We see the downsides there when it comes to batteries that don’t have enough energy for things like eVTOLs or electric aircraft or long-range vehicles,” Lichty said. He also noted that most of Forge Nano’s commercial customers today are in the aerospace and defense industries, but this investment from GM is a step toward broader adoption in the EV industry.
“We’re basically preventing corrosion in the cell that makes them die quickly, whether that’s from heat or from usage,” James Trevey, Forge Nano’s chief technology officer, told TechCrunch. “The more extreme the application, the more improvement you’ll see from Atomic Armor.”
Lichty said in trials and commercial deployments, Forge Nano has been able to “extract more lithium out of that cathode when we cycle than anybody else” using “lithium that’s already in there,” thus increasing the energy density of a battery cell by up to 20%.
“It’s kind of tantamount to finding 20% more lithium just lying around on the ground and being able to access that essentially for free,” he added.
Forge Nano’s coating technology can be plugged directly into a cell manufacturer’s existing process to create cost savings at scale of up to 20%, the CEO said.
The company’s battery cell subsidiary, Forge Battery, is using the Atomic Armor platform to produce prototype cells today while it constructs its own gigafactory in North Carolina using a $100 million award the company received in September from the Department of Energy. Forge Battery expects to start producing 2170 cells with Forge’s Atomic Armor inside in 2026."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/this-week-in-ai-aws-loses-a-top-ai-exec/,This Week in AI: AWS loses a top AI exec | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-16,"Hiya, folks, welcome to TechCrunch’s regular AI newsletter. If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here.
Last week, AWS lost a top AI exec.
Matt Wood, VP of AI, announced that he’d be leaving AWS after 15 years. Wood had long been involved in the Amazon division’s AI initiatives; he was appointed VP in September 2022, just before ChatGPT’s launch.
Wood’s departure comes as AWS reaches a crossroads — and risks being left behind in the generative AI boom. The company’s previous CEO, Adam Selipsky, who stepped down in May, is perceived as having missed the boat.
According to The Information, AWS originally planned to unveil a competitor to ChatGPT at its annual conference in November 2022. But technical issues forced the org to postpone the launch.
Under Selipsky, AWS reportedly also passed on opportunities to back two leading generative AI startups, Cohere and Anthropic. AWS later tried to invest in Cohere but was rejected and had to settle for a co-investment in Anthropic with Google.
It’s worth noting that Amazon broadly hasn’t had a strong generative AI track record as of late. This fall, the company lost execs in Just Walk Out, its division developing cashier-less tech for retail stores. And Amazon reportedly opted to replace its own models with Anthropic’s for an upgraded Alexa assistant after encountering design challenges.
AWS CEO Matt Garman is aggressively moving to right the ship, acqui-hiring AI startups such as Adept and investing in training systems like Olympus. My colleague Frederic Lardinois recently interviewed Garman about AWS’ ongoing efforts; it’s well worth the read.
But AWS’ pathway to generative AI success won’t be easy — no matter how well the company executes on its internal roadmaps.
Investors are increasingly skeptical that Big Tech’s generative AI bets are paying off. After its Q2 earnings call, shares of Amazon plunged by the most since October 2022.
In a recent Gartner poll, 49% of companies said that demonstrating value is their top barrier to generative AI adoption. Gartner predicts, in fact, that a third of generative AI projects will be abandoned after the proof of concept phase by 2026 — due in part to high costs.
Garman sees price as an AWS advantage, potentially, given its projects to develop custom silicon for running and training models. (AWS’ next generation of its custom Trainium chips will launch toward the end of this year.) And AWS has said that its generative AI businesses like Bedrock have already reached a combined “multi-billion-dollar” run rate.
The tough part will be maintaining momentum in the face of headwinds, internal and external. Departures like Wood’s don’t instill a ton of confidence, but maybe — just maybe — AWS has tricks up its sleeve.

Synthetic data and AI: Yours truly wrote about the promise and perils of synthetic data (i.e., AI-generated data), which is being increasingly used to train AI systems.
In collaboration with AI security startup Gray Swan AI, the U.K.’s AI Safety Institute, the government research org focusing on AI safety, has developed a new dataset for measuring the harmfulness of AI “agents.”
Called AgentHarm, the dataset evaluates whether otherwise “safe” agents — AI systems that can undertake certain tasks autonomously — can be manipulated into completing 110 unique “harmful” tasks, like ordering a fake passport from someone on the dark web.
The researchers found that many models — including OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Mistral’s Mistral Large 2 — were willing to engage in harmful behavior, particularly when “attacked” using a jailbreaking technique. Jailbreaks led to higher harmful task success rates, even with models protected by safeguards, the researchers say.
“Simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents,” they wrote in a technical paper, “and these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities.”
The paper, along with the dataset and results, are available here.
There’s a new viral model out there, and it’s a video generator.
Pyramid Flow SD3, as it’s called, arrived on the scene several weeks ago under an MIT license. Its creators — researchers from Peking University, Chinese company Kuaishou Technology, and the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications — claim that it was trained entirely on open source data.
Pyramid Flow comes in two flavors: a model that can generate 5-second clips at 384p resolution (at 24 frames per second) and a more compute-intensive model that can generate 10-second clips at 768p (also at 24 frames per second).
Pyramid Flow can create videos from text descriptions (e.g., “FPV flying over the Great Wall”) or still images. Code to fine-tune the model is coming soon, the researchers say. But for now, Pyramid Flow can be downloaded and used on any machine or cloud instance with around 12GB of video memory.
Anthropic this week updated its Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), the voluntary framework the company uses to mitigate potential risks from its AI systems.
Of note, the new RSP lays out two types of models that Anthropic says would require “upgraded safeguards” before they’re deployed: Models that can essentially self-improve without human oversight and models that can assist in creating weapons of mass destruction.
“If a model can … potentially significantly [accelerate] AI development in an unpredictable way, we require elevated security standards and additional safety assurances,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post. “And if a model can meaningfully assist someone with a basic technical background in creating or deploying CBRN weapons, we require enhanced security and deployment safeguards.”
Sounds sensible to this writer.
In the blog, Anthropic also revealed that it’s looking to hire a head of responsible scaling as it “works to scale up [its] efforts on implementing the RSP.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/are-cybertrucks-too-angular-for-europe/,Are Cybertrucks too angular for Europe? | TechCrunch,Connie Loizos,2024-10-16,"Tesla’s Cybertruck is facing blowback in Europe, particularly over pedestrian safety concerns. Euro NCAP, a voluntary but influential car safety assessment program in Europe, has not in any way tested the Cybertruck, but based on a visual assessment alone, raised alarms over its sharp, angular design, saying it could pose a serious threat to pedestrians. Indeed, Matthew Avery, Euro NCAP’s strategic development director, suggests to Wired that the Cybertruck could receive a poor safety rating, which could doom sales.
Already the small number of Cybertrucks registered in the EU have prompted European transport nongovernmental organizations to call for the trucks’ removal from public roads, saying their oversized, sharp-edged design violates European safety standards and could endanger pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists.
Some U.S. safety experts agree. In an interview with Business Insider late last year, one called the Cybertruck a “guideless missile.” The bigger question is what it means for the truck’s future in Europe, where there’s far more focus on pedestrian protection than in the U.S."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/african-crypto-startup-yellow-card-raises-33m-led-by-blockchain-capital-to-scale-its-b2b-pivot/,African crypto startup Yellow Card raises $33M led by Blockchain Capital to scale its B2B pivot | TechCrunch,Tage Kene-Okafor,2024-10-16,"Africa’s blockchain and crypto space is receiving a much-needed venture boost during a tough time for startups, some of which have retreated from specific markets or completely shut down due to issues like harsh regulatory environment, macros, or downright mismanagement.
The boost involves Yellow Card, the U.S.-founded crypto platform launched in Nigeria in 2019, which has since become the continent’s most-funded cryptocurrency exchange. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised $33 million in Series C investment led by decade-old venture firm Blockchain Capital, whose bets include Coinbase, Kraken, OpenSea, and, more recently, Worldcoin. This brings Yellow Card’s total funding to at least $88 million.
Blockchain Capital’s buy-in to Yellow Card comes as the crypto platform, which initially offered retail customers access to crypto and stablecoins (USDT, USDC, and PYUSD) in 20 African countries using local currencies, is doubling down on its business customers, a shift it started during its $40 million Series B fundraise two years ago. (Yellow Card was valued at $200 million in that round; co-founder and CEO Chris Maurice, without disclosing specifics, says the crypto platform’s current valuation is “a significant bump from the Series B.”)
“The big shift for us has been our focus on working predominantly with businesses now,” Maurice told TechCrunch. “When we started, we targeted the B2C market to serve retail customers. However, we realized that the real users who benefit the most from this technology are businesses.”
Yellow Card served retail customers for the first couple of years after its launch. However, the pivot came when the company, which reached 1 million customers in 2021, according to Maurice, began to notice how incredibly costly it was to handle retail users on the platform. While any crypto customer, regardless of size, must go through sanction screening, KYC, and chain analysis screening, when it came down to volumes, the margins were too thin to make the business sustainable with small retail users. On the other hand, small to large businesses were moving more significant volumes and paying higher gas fees.
As a result, Yellow Card has raised its minimum transaction amounts, a deliberate measure to reduce its broad retail base and grow its appeal to businesses using the platform to manage treasury and access stablecoins.
“Usage of our platform didn’t change — it was more about our shift in targeting and positioning,” answered Maurice when asked if Yellow Card’s description of itself from a cryptocurrency exchange platform to a licensed stablecoin on/off ramp was a result of a change in how customers used the platform. “We’re now more aligned with what our customers, particularly businesses, use us for, which is to manage treasury and access stablecoins. That’s what led to the change in messaging.”
Today, Yellow Card works with about 30,000 businesses across Africa and internationally, helping them with payments and treasury management, primarily through stablecoins.
At first glance, Yellow Card’s focus on businesses might seem to deviate from its original plan to make crypto accessible to the masses. However, Maurice argues that the 8-year-old company is still steered in that direction but is going about it differently.
First, he points out that an individual and a small business are not mutually exclusive in Africa; an example is an individual owning a small kiosk. Hence why Yellow Card’s customer base, despite the slight pivot, still ranges from a trader selling imported shoes to some of the continent’s largest corporations, and everyone in between. “The way business and personal use blend together on the continent creates a very different dynamic, making our approach relevant for both groups,” noted the CEO.
Second, the company believes that serving businesses means individuals could benefit more from the technology than they necessarily do from directly interacting with it.
For instance, by using Yellow Card for treasury management, companies that import food, pharmaceuticals, and consumer goods can make essential items more affordable and accessible, benefiting the broader population, even if individuals aren’t directly engaging with crypto. In other words, the average person gains more from cheaper goods and services — made possible by businesses using Yellow Card — than from using the technology themselves.
While sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the rest of the world in crypto volume (accounting for under 3% of the total transactions performed between July 2023 and 2024), the region has more practical and compelling use cases for crypto than the West. Nigeria, for instance, has the second highest crypto adoption globally; Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa are in the top 30, according to a recent report by Chainalysis.
Stablecoins, particularly, have become the center of utility in Africa’s crypto economy. What’s the play? Most African countries have highly volatile local currencies and limited access to the U.S. dollar. So stablecoins, pegged to the dollar, such as USDT and USDC, offer business and retail customers a way to store value by hedging against inflation and currency devaluation and facilitating international payments and cross-border trade.
Maurice says the utility of stablecoins and demand for its technology from businesses moving larger sums has contributed to Yellow Card’s transaction volumes surging from $1.7 billion early last year to over $3 billion. As a result, the company’s revenue, which it earns via spread between currency prices, has increased sevenfold since January 2023, now “well into eight figures.”
“What’s majorly driving adoption for us is utility. Stablecoins are useful. People need them,” remarked the CEO. “They solve problems for people and businesses. People are adopting this technology because they need it. This is not a speculation use case. It’s a utility use case.”
Yellow Card has two main products: the core on-and-off-ramp and the API suite, which Maurice, on the call, playfully terms “Africa-as-a-service.” The API suite integrates Africa’s banking and mobile money infrastructure, makes it accessible to global companies like Coinbase and Block, and allows them to on- and off-ramp their customers on the continent using Yellow Card’s rails.
No doubt, Yellow Card’s recent financing validates the progress of stablecoins in Africa and its practicality globally. The company will now look to tap more into the opportunities the technology provides by improving its flagship product and API (which has a widget built on top of it).
“The future of payments lies in fast, affordable rails for everyone, powered by open networks,” said Aleks Larsen, general partner at Blockchain Capital. “We couldn’t be more excited to back Yellow Card as they bring Africa on-chain with stablecoins.”
Yellow Card, which self-describes itself as the largest and first licensed stablecoin on-/off-ramp platform in Africa, said Polychain Capital, Block, Inc., Winklevoss Capital, Third Prime Ventures, Castle Island Ventures, Galaxy Ventures, Blockchain Coinvestors, and Hutt Capital also invested in the Series C round.
It added that the funding will also allow it to develop new products, strengthen its team and systems, and continue to lead engagement with regulators across the continent.
Regulation is the bane of crypto platforms’ existence globally. Companies like Binance and Coinbase are facing lawsuits for allegedly offering unregistered securities in the U.S. Meanwhile, crypto remains heavily restricted in certain countries, including China, with continued crackdowns on mining and exchanges.
Separately, the recent debacle between Binance and Nigeria — the country has detained one of the crypto platform’s executives, Tigran Gambaryan, for eight months over allegations that Binance was undermining its local currency — is one reason crypto platforms need to keep talking with regulators.
With strict and fuzzy rules governing how people use crypto in different markets, Maurice argues that African regulators have been much more innovative and have a better understanding of the technology than other regions. He cites the recent licensing guidelines in Nigeria, frameworks in countries like South Africa, Botswana, Tanzania, and Zambia, and the introduction of a sandbox environment in Ghana to support his point.
“Obviously, the goal is that we continue to see and develop clear regulatory frameworks globally. I think Africa has an unfair reputation when it comes to regulation. In reality, it’s often a much more crypto-friendly environment than the U.S. right now,” Maurice said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/amazon-jumps-on-nuclear-power-bandwagon-by-investing-in-x-energy-and-promising-small-reactors/,​​Amazon jumps on nuclear power bandwagon by investing in X-Energy and promising small reactors | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-10-16,"Amazon today became the latest Big Tech company to throw its weight behind nuclear power, joining Microsoft and Google, which both previously announced long-term promises to buy nuclear power from startups to power their data centers.
The company revealed three deals, including an investment in startup X-Energy and two development agreements that aim to add around 300 megawatts’ worth of capacity in both the Pacific Northwest and Virginia, two data center hot spots.
The two development deals outline the construction of small modular reactors (SMR), which generate a fraction of the power produced by contemporary nuclear power plants but which proponents say will be faster and cheaper to build. Amazon expects the reactors will start generating electricity in the early 2030s.
In the Pacific Northwest, the agreement with the Energy Northwest consortium of state public utilities will support the construction of four SMRs that will produce around 320 megawatts combined. Future expansion could bump the total generating capacity to 960 megawatts, enough to power about 1 million homes. In Virginia, Amazon and Dominion have agreed to “explore the development” of 300 megawatts’ worth of SMRs near the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station located between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia.
Those projects are likely to be built using technology from X-Energy, an SMR startup based in Rockville, Maryland. Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund led a new $500 million Series C-1 round into the company, with participation from other investors, including Citadel founder Ken Griffin, NGP, and the University of Michigan. The new round adds to the $385 million the company has raised to date, according to PitchBook.
X-Energy specializes in high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors, an approach that fell out of favor in the U.S. and Europe but as new designs emerged was more recently revived in Japan and China.
When built, X-Energy’s Xe-100 reactor will generate 80 megawatts of electricity. Its uranium fuel is coated with three layers of carbon, and 18,000 of these poppy seed-sized particles are then loaded into a billiard-ball-sized “pebble,” and 200,000 of those pebbles are used per reactor. Helium flows between the pebbles, where it’s heated to 750°C. That heat is then transferred to water, which generates steam to spin a turbine.
The fuel system, known as TRISO, is touted as being safer than existing nuclear fuel designs, with the particles containing the uranium under high temperatures.
X-Energy’s first reactor will be built at a Dow chemical plant outside Corpus Christi, Texas. The company has not announced when the project will be completed and said that it intends to develop up to 5,000 megawatts of new nuclear power throughout the U.S. by 2039.
The new deals with Amazon, like the deal Google announced on Monday with Kairos, give nuclear fission a boost in the face of growing progress on nuclear fusion and the steady march of power from renewable sources like solar and wind, which have become considerably cheaper over the last decade. Although nuclear power is widespread, new reactor designs have yet to be commercially proven, and their timeline puts them in direct competition with other sources of carbon-free power that promise to decarbonize the electrical grid in the coming decade."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/the-ftc-makes-it-easier-to-cancel-subscriptions-like-gym-memberships/,"The FTC makes it easier to cancel subscriptions like streaming services, memberships and Prime | TechCrunch",Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-16,"Soon, it’ll be easier to end recurring subscriptions and memberships — if the FTC has its way.
Today, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced a final “click-to-cancel” rule that’ll require companies selling subscription-based products to make it “as easy for consumers to cancel their enrollment as it was to sign up.”
First put forth for comment last year, the rule applies to any automatically renewing subscription, ranging from streaming services to gym memberships and payments for plans like Amazon Prime.
Under the rule, businesses — including those offering free trials that charge if you don’t cancel in time — can’t force customers to end a subscription using a method different from how they signed up. The rule also requires that companies provide any pertinent info, like how to cancel, before obtaining customers’ billing information and charging them.
The rule is slightly modified from what the FTC initially proposed, which would’ve mandated businesses send annual reminders on how to cancel subscriptions, as well. The rule as originally written would’ve also prevented companies from trying to persuade customers not to cancel — for example, by showing them plan modifications — without explicit consent.
The FTC says that it receives thousands of complaints about duplicitous subscription plans each year — and that these numbers have been steadily increasing over the past five years. In 2024, the FTC received around 70 complaints per day, up from 42 per day in 2021.
“Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,” FTC commissioner Lina Kahn said in a statement. “The FTC’s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.”
Most of the rule’s provisions will go into effect 180 days after they’re published in the federal register, the official daily publication for rules and notices from U.S. federal agencies."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/glovo-adds-a-side-of-social-stickiness-to-its-food-delivery-app/,Glovo adds a side of social stickiness to its food delivery app | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-16,"Do you want a side of socials with your fast food? Spain’s Glovo, a food delivery and quick commerce service where the bulk of orders are for ready-to-eat food, is experimenting with adding a bundle of social features to drive more in-app activity.
It’s also letting restaurant partners upload food preparation videos to spice up the user experience by being able to push a feed of rich media at its users.
Glovo says the new social features will let users find and connect with friends who are also using the app. This is powered by matching a user’s phone contacts to existing Glovo users and sending permission requests to connect. It enables users who opt in to be able to share recommendations and discover restaurants their friends have liked.
Another new feature called “Picks” lets Glovo users save and organize their favorite restaurants by creating and managing lists. These picks/lists can be private or shareable with friends.
For the food videos feature, the app is replicating the vertical feed that’s popular on social media apps like TikTok to give restaurants a new marketing opportunity — letting them display a showreel of stuff on their menu.
Glovo is not producing any of the food videos itself but does apply guidelines to submissions from restaurants, which it says are intended to ensure high quality (it says it’s had close to 400 submissions so far). “The content is strictly focused on the food offered, and other types of promotions are not allowed,” it noted.
The app updates, which Glovo previewed at a new annual product event called Glovo Next, will go live in its home city of Barcelona first before being rolled out to other cities in Spain this month. If all goes to plan, the company says it will keep expanding the rollout to reach the other 22 countries where it operates.
While the quick commerce category in general has been through a bumpy ride over the last few years, undergoing something of a post-pandemic correction, Glovo — which is owned by Germany’s Delivery Hero — denies the new updates are a response to any flagging consumer interest in its delivery app.
“Glovo shows an outstanding GMV [Gross Merchandise Volume] growth trajectory (+44% FY2022 versus FY2024) with strong performance across all countries,” Daniel Alonso, Glovo’s vice president product, told TechCrunch.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to improve by around 10 percentage points compared to how the company was operating before its late 2021 acquisition by Delivery Hero, he also said — crediting this to continued growth in profitable markets and to “less mature markets” scaling up.
Glovo is expected to reach positive adjusted EBITDA in the second half of this year, Alonso added.
The company also told us its quick commerce division — which offers speedy deliveries of grocery items, flowers, books, pet supplies, toiletries, and electronics picked out of stock ranged at its city center-located dark stores — is growing at over 50% year-over-year.
So if growth on its straightforward, transactional app is strong why has it decided to experiment with layering social media stickiness on top? Alonso says this is about Glovo continuing its brand building efforts and looking for ways to  help users with the tricky decision of what meal to order in tonight.
The company said it hopes the features will boost food discoverability, including by tapping into the pull of friend-based recommendations. “We believe that building a social network inside Glovo will help users to make food ordering decisions and more,” said Alonso. “We have built an MVP to see whether this is the case, and time will tell if this is going to be successful.”
“Deciding what to order can be overwhelming with so many options,” he added. “The video discovery wall adds a dynamic, visual element to food exploration, making the process easier and more engaging. These videos, created by local restaurants, allow users to see how dishes are prepared and what they look like, helping them make more informed choices.”
On the permissions and privacy side, Alonso claimed: “Glovo does not share or upload any data without explicit consent.”
He said a user must actively grant access to their contact list in order to add friends — who must themselves provide express consent to connecting with the requested user before any information about their food delivery habits gets shared with friends.
“In order to see which of your friends have rated positively or have placed an order, you need to ensure that they have become your Glovo friends,” he noted, adding: “The shared data includes restaurants the user’s friends have ordered from in the last three months.”
Glovo users are able to revoke consent previously given to accessing their contacts, per Alonso, and can remove friends from their social list at any time after they’ve been added.
Additionally, Alonso confirmed that only contacts who are already Glovo users can receive an invitation to connect, so this isn’t that particular (notorious) growth hacking trick."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/google-will-now-help-you-find-the-cheapest-flights-available-for-your-trip/,Google will now help you find the cheapest flights available for your trip | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-16,"Google is introducing a new feature that will help you find the cheapest flights for your next trip. The company announced on Wednesday that it’s adding a new “cheapest” tab on Google Flights.
Up until now, Google has displayed what it considers the “best” options at the top of the results based on both price and convenience. However, some people may be willing to give up some convenience if it means spending less money.
Now, if you click the “cheapest” tab, you will see the lowest prices available. For instance, you might see a link to a third-party booking site offering a lower price than the airline itself. Or, you may see the option to save money by flying back to a different airport in the same city you flew out of, such as departing from New York’s LaGuardia and flying back to JFK.
Google notes that some of the options under the new tab are more “creative,” as they include things like longer layovers, self-transfers where you book two connecting flights yourself, or the option to buy different legs of your trip through multiple airlines or booking sites.
The company says the feature is meant for those times when costs matter more than convenience, as the tab can help see the lowest prices available and then allow you to decide which tradeoffs you want to make.
The new tab is rolling out globally over the next two weeks."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/how-paladins-drones-helped-asheville-during-hurricane-helene/,How Paladin's drones helped Asheville during Hurricane Helene | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-10-16,"When Hurricane Helene hit Asheville, North Carolina in September, the city’s police department reached out to public safety drone startup Paladin for help. The startup’s 30-member team jumped into action working nights and through the weekend to assist Asheville’s police department with locating people and dropping off supplies.
Asheville was a Paladin customer and its team was able to help because its software could control drones remotely from the company’s Houston headquarters, Paladin founder and CEO Divy Shrivastava told TechCrunch. This allowed Paladin’s tech to make a big difference in spite of Asheville’s closed roads and lack of cell phone or internet service on the ground.
“I think it has painted a clear picture for me of what the future of the drone industry will look like,” Shrivastava said. “We were grateful that Asheville trusted us to help.”
While able to help in a natural disaster, Paladin was launched as first responder technology meant to help to reduce the time between a 911 call and help being on the way, Shrivastava said.
Paladin’s software is designed to work with any drone, and to be easy to use, Shrivastava said. When a 911 dispatcher gets a call, a Paladin-powered drone is dispatched within 90 seconds to the scene of the call. The public safety department can then see the situation from its office to determine what kinds of resources need to be sent, if any.
The motive behind Paladin is a personal one. When Shrivastava was 17 years old and living in Ohio, his friend’s house caught on fire. While 911 had been called right away, first responders took a while to get there. The house ended up burning to the ground and the experience stuck with Shrivastava.
“I got really obsessed with this problem of not having modern infrastructure for public safety,” Shrivastava said. “It seemed obvious at that point, the problems were slow response times and lack of situational awareness. A drone has a camera and can bridge the gap in information. You’ll be looking at a live feed of exactly what the emergency is.”
Shrivastava began working on the idea in college before dropping out to do the Thiel Fellowship, an incubator program led by Peter Thiel. He formally launched the company in 2018 and started selling in 2021. Since then the company has landed contracts with dozens of public safety departments, it says, and is seeing its revenue nearly double quarter over quarter.
Paladin recently raised a $5.2 million seed round led by Gradient, Google’s early-stage AI fund, with participation from Khosla Ventures, 1517, and Toyota Ventures, among others. The raise will be used to continue to build out Paladin’s software capabilities, and to put resources toward getting the company’s name out there more, Shrivastava said.
In addition to the funding, the company also announced a host of new capabilities for its drone software, including the ability for drones to drop off supplies at a 911 call, like Narcan or life vests, and the ability for drones to spot and navigate around other aircraft.
Shrivastava said that the company has not only been able to help reduce the time between a 911 call and its response but also help clear 10-25% of 911 calls that are either false or miscalls that don’t require a response at all. He added that clearing unnecessary calls makes a huge difference because many police departments are short on officers and resources.
“The majority of departments, they have less than 50 sworn officers,” Shrivastava said. “One piece of technology that is making you 25% more efficient is significant. What is sometimes easy to forget is the majority of the country are very small towns with limited resources. These are problems they see all the time.”
Shrivastava knows what some people will think when they hear Paladin is helping equip police departments with drones — that they will be used for surveillance or for patrolling in general. He said Paladin was really intentional about its software’s use cases and said it’s designed to only activate in response to a 911 call.
He added they are also compliant with drone regulations in all 50 states and that the drones won’t start taking video until they arrive at their destination.
Using technology to make public safety work better is an area seeing more interest from entrepreneurs as of late. Prepared is another startup building in this space with a similar mission. Prepared is building a system to help 911 dispatchers by giving them a more complete picture of what is happening at the site of a call using video. Prepared has raised more than $70 million in venture capital.
Shrivastava said that demand is there from public safety departments and that the startup is now getting multiple inbound requests for the tech a week.
“We are still early in terms of the entire market,” Shrivastava said. “We are in dozens of cities right now and have scaled pretty quickly, but that is less than 0.1% of the market.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/boston-dynamics-teams-with-tri-to-bring-ai-smarts-to-atlas-humanoid-robot/,Boston Dynamics teams with TRI to bring AI smarts to Atlas humanoid robot | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-16,"Boston Dynamics and Toyota Research Institute (TRI) Wednesday revealed plans to bring AI-based robotic intelligence to the electric Atlas humanoid robot. The collaboration will leverage the work that TRI has done around large behavior models (LBMs), which operate along similar lines as the more familiar large language models (LLMs) behind platforms like ChatGPT.
Last September, TechCrunch paid a visit to TRI’s Bay Area campus for a closer look at the institute’s work on robot learning. In research revealed at last year’s Disrupt conference, institute head Gill Pratt explained how the lab has been able to get robots to 90% accuracy when performing household tasks like flipping pancakes through overnight training.
“In machine learning, up until quite recently there was a tradeoff, where it works, but you need millions of training cases,” Pratt explained at the time. “When you’re doing physical things, you don’t have time for that many, and the machine will break down before you get to 10,000. Now it seems that we need dozens. The reason for the dozens is that we need to have some diversity in the training cases. But in some cases, it’s less.”
Boston Dynamics is a good match for TRI on the hardware side. The Spot-maker has done its share on the software and AI front to power its own systems, but the manner of work required to teach robots to perform complex tasks with full autonomy is another beast altogether.
“There has never been a more exciting time for the robotics industry, and we look forward to working with TRI to accelerate the development of general-purpose humanoids,” Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter notes in a statement. “This partnership is an example of two companies with a strong research-and-development foundation coming together to work on many complex challenges and build useful robots that solve real-world problems.”
Boston Dynamics revealed its design for the electric Atlas in April, as it finally put to rest the humanoid’s larger, hydraulic namesake. While we’ve seen very little of the robot since then, in August, TechCrunch managed to get its hands on a short video of the robot doing pushups. Like Atlas’ initial video, the quick pushup demo was a good demonstration of the robot’s remarkable strength.
Boston Dynamics’ chief competition in the humanoid robot space, including Agility, Figure, and Tesla, have primarily opted to build out their AI teams in-house. The Boston Dynamics-TRI deal is especially interesting given that the organizations are run by Hyundai and Toyota — direct competitors in the automotive space.
Meanwhile, Boston Dynamics has its own research spinout, The AI Institute (formerly The Boston Dynamics AI Institute). Though run by Boston Dynamics founder and former CEO Marc Raibert, the institute maintains independence from Boston Dynamics, proper. It’s also a significantly younger organization still in the process of building out its team. TRI, for its part, has become less invested in the hardware side of the equation.
The goal in all of this is a true general-purpose machine. That is to say, a system that is essentially capable of learning and doing all of the things a person can do — and, presumably, more. While we’ve seen robot hardware evolve closer to a point capable of that level of sophistication, something that approaches general intelligence is a much tougher nut to crack.
Certainly, the advent of SDK for systems has helped dramatically increase the breadth of tasks that can be performed by robots like Boston Dynamics’ Spot, but true artificial general intelligence is further off — if we ever get there."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/mistral-releases-new-ai-models-optimized-for-edge-devices/,Mistral releases new AI models optimized for laptops and phones | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-16,"French AI startup Mistral has released its first generative AI models designed to be run on edge devices, like laptops and phones.
The new family of models, which Mistral is calling “Les Ministraux,” can be used or tuned for a variety of applications, from basic text generation to working in conjunction with more capable models to complete tasks.
Two Les Ministraux models are available — Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B — both of which have a context window of 128,000 tokens, meaning they can ingest roughly the length of a 50-page book.
“Our most innovative customers and partners have increasingly been asking for local, privacy-first inference for critical applications such as on-device translation, internet-less smart assistants, local analytics, and autonomous robotics,” Mistral writes in a blog post. “Les Ministraux were built to provide a compute-efficient and low-latency solution for these scenarios.”
Ministral 8B is available for download as of today — albeit strictly for research purposes. Mistral is requiring devs and companies interested in Ministral 8B or Ministral 3B self-deployment setups to contact it for a commercial license.
Otherwise, devs can use Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B through Mistral’s cloud platform, La Platforme, and other clouds with which the startup has partnered in the coming weeks. Ministral 8B costs 10 cents per million output/input tokens (~750,000 words), while Ministral 3B costs 4 cents per million output/input tokens.
There’s been a trend toward small models, lately, which are cheaper and quicker to train, fine-tune, and run than their larger counterparts. Google continues to add models to its Gemma small model family, while Microsoft offers its Phi collection of models. In the most recent refresh of its Llama suite, Meta introduced several small models optimized for edge hardware.
Mistral claims that Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B outperform comparable Llama and Gemma models — as well as its own Mistral 7B — on several AI benchmarks designed to evaluate instruction-following and problem-solving capabilities.
Paris-based Mistral, which recently raised $640 million in venture capital, continues to gradually expand its AI product portfolio. Over the past few months, the company has launched a free service for developers to test its models, an SDK to let customers fine-tune those models, and new models, including a generative model for code called Codestral.
Co-founded by alumni from Meta and Google’s DeepMind, Mistral’s stated mission is to create flagship models that rival the best-performing models today, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude — and ideally make money in the process. While the “making money” bit is proving to be challenging (as it is for most generative AI startups), Mistral reportedly began to generate revenue this summer."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/lightmatters-400m-d-round-has-ai-hyperscalers-hyped-for-photonic-datacenters/,Lightmatter's $400M round has AI hyperscalers hyped for photonic data centers | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-16,"Photonic computing startup Lightmatter has raised $400 million to blow one of modern data centers’ bottlenecks wide open. The company’s optical interconnect layer allows hundreds of GPUs to work synchronously, streamlining the costly and complex job of training and running AI models.
The growth of AI and its correspondingly immense compute requirements have supercharged the data center industry, but it’s not as simple as plugging in another thousand GPUs. As high-performance computing experts have known for years, it doesn’t matter how fast each node of your supercomputer is if those nodes are idle half the time waiting for data to come in.
The interconnect layer or layers are really what turn racks of CPUs and GPUs into effectively one giant machine — so it follows that the faster the interconnect, the faster the data center. And it is looking like Lightmatter builds the fastest interconnect layer by a long shot, by using the photonic chips it’s been developing since 2018.
“Hyperscalers know if they want a computer with a million nodes, they can’t do it with Cisco traditional switches. Once you leave the rack, you go from high-density interconnect to basically a cup on a string,” Nick Harris, CEO and founder of the company, told TechCrunch. (You can see a short talk he gave summarizing this issue here.)
The state of the art, he said, is NVLink and particularly the NVL72 platform, which puts 72 Nvidia Blackwell units wired together in a rack, capable of a maximum of 1.4 exaFLOPs at FP4 precision. But no rack is an island, and all that compute has to be squeezed out through 7 terabits of “scale up” networking. Sounds like a lot, and it is, but the inability to network these units faster to each other and to other racks is one of the main barriers to improving performance.
“For a million GPUs, you need multiple layers of switches, and that adds a huge latency burden,” said Harris. “You have to go from electrical to optical to electrical to optical… the amount of power you use and the amount of time you wait is huge. And it gets dramatically worse in bigger clusters.”
So what’s Lightmatter bringing to the table? Fiber. Lots and lots of fiber, routed through a purely optical interface. With up to 1.6 terabits per fiber (using multiple colors), and up to 256 fibers per chip… well, let’s just say that 72 GPUs at 7 terabits starts to sound positively quaint.
“Photonics is coming way faster than people thought — people have been struggling to get it working for years, but we’re there,” said Harris. “After seven years of absolutely murderous grind,” he added.
The photonic interconnect currently available from Lightmatter does 30 terabits, while the on-rack optical wiring is capable of letting 1,024 GPUs work synchronously in their own specially designed racks. In case you’re wondering, the two numbers don’t increase by similar factors because a lot of what would need to be networked to another rack can be done on-rack in a thousand-GPU cluster. (And anyway, 100 terabit is on its way.)
The market for this is huge, Harris pointed out, with every major data center company from Microsoft to Amazon to newer entrants like xAI and OpenAI showing an endless appetite for compute. “They’re linking together buildings! I wonder how long they can keep it up,” he said.
Many of these hyperscalers are already customers, though Harris wouldn’t name any. “Think of Lightmatter a little like a foundry, like TSMC,” he said. “We don’t pick favorites or attach our name to other people’s brands. We provide a roadmap and a platform for them — just helping grow the pie.”
But, he added coyly, “you don’t quadruple your valuation without leveraging this tech,” perhaps an allusion to OpenAI’s recent funding round valuing the company at $157 billion, but the remark could just as easily be about his own company.
This $400 million D round values it at $4.4 billion, a similar multiple of its mid-2023 valuation that “makes us by far the largest photonics company. So that’s cool!” said Harris. The round was led by T. Rowe Price Associates, with participation from existing investors Fidelity Management & Research Company and GV.
What’s next? In addition to interconnect, the company is developing new substrates for chips so that they can perform even more intimate, if you will, networking tasks using light.
Harris speculated that, apart from interconnect, power per chip is going to be the big differentiator going forward. “In 10 years you’ll have wafer-scale chips from everybody — there’s just no other way to improve the performance per chip,” he said. Cerebras is of course already working on this, though whether they are able to capture the true value of that advance at this stage of the technology is an open question.
But for Harris, seeing the chip industry coming up against a wall, he plans to be ready and waiting with the next step. “Ten years from now, interconnect is Moore’s Law,” he said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/amazon-revamps-kindle-line-with-faster-page-turns-ai-and-a-new-green-color/,"Amazon revamps Kindle line with faster page turns, AI, and a new green color | TechCrunch",Brian Heater,2024-10-16,"Amazon’s Kindle line seems to go longer and longer between updates. While e-readers aren’t quite the consumer electronics darlings they once were, the retail giant is still invested in the category. After all, according to estimates, Amazon controls more than 80% of the U.S. market.
Along with the long-awaited addition of a color Kindle, Amazon announced a refresh across the line. That includes updates to the base Kindle, Kindle Paperwhite, and the stylus-enabled Kindle Scribe.
Amazon had to bring AI to the line sooner or later, so the Kindle Scribe is the first to get the honors. Leveraging the biggest Kindle’s note-taking capabilities, Amazon is adding text summaries, courtesy of a new notebook tab. The device will also clean up messy text scribbled with the Premium Pen stylus, so it’s legible while still looking like script.
The Scribe’s design language has also evolved a bit, with the addition of white borders, while the resolution remains 300 ppi. The device will also be getting a new side panel feature, which lets users write and hide notes as needed.
The new Scribe will run $399 — that’s a $50 premium over its predecessor’s already steep price tag.
The Kindle Paperwhite, the best-selling model, is getting a display bump from 6.8 inches to a full seven inches. The device is getting a processor bump, as well, with Amazon promising 25% faster paper turns. The company rates the Paperwhite’s battery at an impressive three months on a charge, in spite of a thinner design.
The reader is getting the same new oxide back pane found in the Colorsoft device, which allows for those faster page turns, while increasing overall battery life.
The standard Paperwhite includes 16GB of storage and is priced at $160. Another $30 will get you the Signature Edition, which includes 32GB of storage, wireless charging capabilities, and an auto-adjusting front light.
The base-level Kindle is following suit with faster page turns, a higher contrast ratio, and a 25% brighter front light, which puts it inline with the Paperwhite when set to max. Amazon is also adding a “matcha” green color. The entry-level reader starts at $110.
The Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite are available now. The new Kindle Scribe starts shipping December 4."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/amazon-kindle-finally-gets-color/,Amazon Kindle finally gets color | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-16,"It’s a big week in Kindle land. Along with refreshes to the base Kindle, Paperwhite, and Scribe, the company is introducing something many of us never expected in a devoted e-reader: color.
Earlier this year, Amazon’s chief e-reader competitor, Kobo, introduced the $220 Libra Colour, which leverages color E Ink. The technology has thus far received mixed reviews. The new Kindle Colorsoft, on the other hand, takes a whole different approach.
Rather than relying on the E Ink technology that powers the Kobo, Amazon opted to build the full stack in-house. The company tells TechCrunch that color has been one of the most requested features for its e-readers, but the company had to strike a balance before adopting it. A number of factors come into play here, including battery life, contrast ratio, and image ghosting.
Color is created with an E Ink Kaleido color filter applied to the display itself, combined with the front light. It’s a change from the standard sort of backlighting we see in tablets, which is both a hit to battery and can impact sleep patterns when reading immediately before bed.
As with monochrome E Ink, the technology effectively creates an image that remains static until the page is refreshed. Amazon says the goal was to create colors that are soft on the eyes, akin to print. Battery life does take a hit here, but that’s countered to some degree by the new oxide back pane, along with a larger battery than the one found on the Paperwhite. The oxide tech — also found on the new Paperwhite — helps increase page-turn speed.
When not utilizing color for things like comics and page highlights, the page retains the same monochromatic design found on other Kindles.
As with the new Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, the Kindle Colorsoft is waterproof, while featuring wireless charging. According to Amazon, you should get up to eight weeks on a charge, which is still handily beat by the Paperwhite’s stated three months.
The color Kindle doesn’t come cheap. The device starts at $280, a $90 premium over the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition and a full $170 more than the new base-level Kindle. That said, it’s still $120 cheaper than the new Kindle Scribe, which I suppose puts things into perspective.
The new Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is available for preorder starting Wednesday. It will start shipping on October 30."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/treehouse-uses-ai-to-help-electricians-install-tech-like-ev-chargers-and-heat-pumps-more-cheaply/,Treehouse uses AI to help electricians install tech like EV chargers and heat pumps more cheaply | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-10-16,"The U.S. is facing a shortage of electricians, with unfilled jobs in the field expected to grow by 11% per year over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But because prospective electricians in the U.S. typically need to log 8,000 hours before they can get their license, the shortage won’t ease anytime soon.
In normal times, the shortage may pose an inconvenience while the labor market shifts in response. But the U.S. is in the midst of a tectonic shift in how people and businesses use electricity. Adding solar panels, swapping furnaces for heat pumps, and adding electric vehicle chargers — they all require electricians, piling projects on the limited number in the workforce today.
“That pipeline takes a long time to build, and there’s not going to be a lot of relief coming in the next five to 10 years,” Eric Owski, co-founder and CEO of Treehouse, told TechCrunch. “We have to make the existing workforce more efficient.”
In building trades, inefficiencies can come in many forms, but one of the most prominent is the site visit to scope and quote a job. “Do you have to roll a truck?” Owski said. “In most cases, if there’s a bit of uncertainty, they roll a truck.” Depending on where a job is located, those visits can consume precious hours.
Owski and his co-founders, several of whom previously worked at LinkedIn, started Treehouse with those visits in mind. To minimize “truck rolls,” the company has gathered data on housing footprints and the details of various electrical jobs in a range of homes. It has fed those into AI models to predict how long it’ll take a new job to complete and how many materials it’ll require.
According to Owski, the company has made progress, particularly on simpler jobs like EV charger installations. “We do the vast majority of EV charger installs, I think well north of 90%, without a truck roll prior to the day of installation,” he said.
For those jobs, Treehouse asks the customer a handful of questions, including what are the major uses of electricity in their home, like stoves or water heaters. That helps the company determine if the homeowner will need to upgrade their electrical connection or main panel. The survey also asks people to drop a pin on a map to show where they would like their charger to go. The goal is to give customers a quote while they’re sitting at a car dealership.
“They need clarity on pricing, and if they’re going to finance that purchase, we have to be very good at it,” Owski said.
Beyond EV chargers, Treehouse will also install heat pumps, whole-house batteries, and thermostats, and electrical panels. For more complex jobs like heat pumps, the company will ask the homeowner to submit more details, including photos of their home’s circuit breaker. If the company still needs more information, it’ll try a virtual visit with the customer, and if that fails, it’ll roll a truck. “We are building automation to avoid those surprises,” Owski said.
Treehouse has plenty of competition in the space, including Qmerit, Kopperfield, and Zero Homes.
Like much of its competition, Treehouse quotes the job, designs the installation, and develops a plan for the permit application. In many cases, it then hands that off to an independent electrician to do the work.
Unlike some other platforms, which focus on generating leads for contractors, Treehouse is licensed as an electrician and serves as the lead contractor, with independent electricians working as subs. In California and Colorado, Treehouse also employs its own electricians, and it plans on hiring more in six to eight other markets over the next year, Owski said.
The startup recently raised a $16 million Series A led by Flourish Ventures with participation from Acrew Capital, CarMax, Eaton, Holman, Invest Detroit, inVest Ventures, MassMutual Ventures, Montage Ventures, Veriten, and Virta Ventures.
Owski said the funding will go toward hiring more engineers to improve the models that help it automate quoting. It’s also expanding geographically; currently, Treehouse works in 40 states, and Owski said it should be in all 50 by the end of the year. The company currently has partnerships with CarMax, Holman, Emporia, Quilt, and ChargePoint.
EVs might be many people’s entry point to electrification, but Owski thinks that’ll just be the first step for many. “I think we’re going through a multi-decade super cycle,” Owski said. “EVs are going to transform the way the average consumer thinks about home energy.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/fable-adds-cognitive-and-hearing-impairments-to-its-accessibility-tools-with-25m-round/,Fable adds cognitive and hearing impairments to its accessibility tools with $25M round | TechCrunch,Devin Coldewey,2024-10-16,"Fable has gained a reputation as the go-to startup for helping companies build digital products that are more accessible to people with disabilities. After raising $25 million in new funding, the Toronto-based startup is now expanding the communities it supports and working to make AI training data more inclusive.
Fable started in 2020 as a way to consult more easily with accessibility experts and people with disabilities, so anyone building a product could have the best advice on making it as accessible as possible. Since its A round two years later, it has been building out a more robust product offering, with content, testing, and tools that integrate more directly with developers’ workflows.
“Accessibility is no longer just the responsibility of the accessibility specialists or product managers — it’s shifting to everyone in the product development process: researchers, designers, product managers, engineers,” said CEO and co-founder Alwar Pillai in an interview with TechCrunch. “It’s historically been another group that’s been responsible for it and doing the work. Now they’re taking that shared accountability and responsibility, and Fable is a platform that’s allowing them to do it by themselves.”
Companies building and maintaining large platforms have come to accept the fact that you can’t sprinkle accessibility on at the very end like Salt Bae. It has to be baked in from the start — and making the product better for people with disabilities usually makes it better for everyone else, too.
Fable initially supported vision and motor disabilities to get a warm start, Pillai explained:
“We wanted to find a way just to get companies comfortable with engaging with this population, because it has historically been excluded, and these were communities that organizations are a bit more familiar with. Over the course of time, we’ve observed a couple of trends within our customer base that made it like this is the right time for us to expand our community to represent people with cognitive disabilities and with hearing disabilities.”
One in six people has some form of disability, she noted, though not all are visible or even something a person may mention. There are lots of assumptions built into user experiences, about what a user can see, hear, do, and understand. Finding and improving them is not always easy if you don’t have, say, a deaf person or someone with dyslexia on your testing team.
“If you get the insights from these communities, you are going to, at the end, make products that work well for everyone. But it has been historically challenging for enterprises to engage with this community easily, and on demand. And that’s when Fable jumps in,” she said.
Over the years, Fable has built out assessment tools as well as advisory ones, so product managers and engineers can track accessibility the way they do other standard function and quality milestones.
A new area of tech that deserves special attention, and which Fable is hoping to improve, is the data powering AI models. Bias in data translates to bias in models, and that’s as true for people with disabilities as it is for other categories.
One reason for this is that these AI models tend to aim for the most aggressively average answer or response — dead center on the bell curve. But people with disabilities tend to fall outside that average need or experience.
“We’re excited and cautious about the proliferation of AI; there’s a huge opportunity to make experiences better for people with disabilities,” said Pillai. “But at the same time, it also has the ability to amplify the digital divide that exists. We’re seeing AI getting baked into so many things, but because people with disabilities have not been taken into account there, and the data that you probably collect is smaller, so they get excluded from the large models, we think they have the ability to exclude the experiences of people with disabilities because it deviates from the ‘normal.’ “
This can be mitigated with fine-tuning or prompt engineering, but only so much; a model necessarily pulls from the datasets it’s trained on, so if disabilities are not adequately represented in there — and they aren’t — the models simply are not equipped for accessibility. Fable has been working with the community, as well as researchers and governments, to create resources and best practices.
“Our goal is that, in the near future, we’re able to introduce these inclusive datasets and offer testing for accessibility in AI. Our customers are already coming to us for it,” Pillai said.
She emphasized that, as before, it’s about empowerment to include these methods in a company’s own development processes — Fable doesn’t do the work for them.
“Our platform now has become this dashboard where you can monitor all of your digital properties and products against these accessibility metrics. We invested in integrations, because we wanted the insights and data to live in the products that product teams are using on a daily basis,” Pillai said. “We’ve gone from just being able to get one piece of insight to really being able to observe your performance across products, and when you think about enterprises, they have, like, 500-plus digital products. The goal for them is, how do I know if I’m getting better or not? And finally, they have metrics to prove it.”
The $25 million B round, led by Five Elms Capital, will be put toward standing up the new teams and products around cognitive and hearing impairments, and of course AI expertise as well. Pillai said that, while the investment climate isn’t as open as it was a few years ago, they were pleasantly surprised while they were raising.
“It was so different from the last few times we raised,” Pillai recalled. “I remember when we raised our seed and Series A it was very much, you know, trying to convince investors about the opportunity around the accessibility space. But this time around, investors had a very strong understanding of the space, the growth opportunity. It was more about, you know, how much value are you adding to customers, and how are you growing? I think that stood out.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/elon-musks-x-dodges-eus-dma-as-bloc-decides-platform-isnt-important-enough-for-fairness-controls/,Elon Musk's X dodges EU's DMA as bloc decides platform isn't important enough for fairness controls | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-16,"Elon Musk’s X won’t be regulated under the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) the Commission decided Wednesday, despite the social media platform hitting usage thresholds earlier this year.
The decision means X won’t be subject to the DMA’s list of operational “dos and don’ts” — in areas like its use of third-party data and user consent to tracking ads — for the foreseeable future. The pan-EU regime targets Big Tech with up-front rules that are generally aimed at ensuring fairer dealing with individual and business users (so far seven companies have been designated as DMA gatekeepers for a total of two dozen “core platform services,” including other social media giants like Meta and TikTok).
While not joining the DMA gatekeeper club is undoubtedly good news for Musk, since he dodges the regulatory risk of being subject to the bloc’s flagship market contestability regime — where penalties for violations can reach up to 10% of global annual turnover (or more for repeat breaches) — the reason for X not being designated may sting his ego: the Commission has decided X is not an important gateway for businesses to reach consumers.
Think of it as the EU throwing shade on the bottom-feeding caliber of X’s ad business these days. Or, tl;dr, if most of your ads are for drop-shipping companies flogging dubious-looking earwax cleaners or polyester rugs so violently patterned they could make a sofa-sitter seasick, your business is irrelevant.
Still, X will surely be happy to flutter free of any DMA risk. The platform had submitted arguments against being designated when it notified the EU back in May that it had hit the 45 million monthly active users and 10,000 business users bar. We’ve contacted X’s press line for comment.
“Following a thorough assessment of all arguments, including input by relevant stakeholders, and after consulting the Digital Markets Advisory Committee, the Commission concluded that X does indeed not qualify as a gatekeeper in relation to its online social networking service, given that the investigation revealed that X is not an important gateway for business users to reach end users,” the Commission wrote in a press release.
The EU added that it will continue to monitor developments in X’s market position. In the case of substantial changes in market power it could re-visit the designation issue. But with Musk in charge and continuing to alienate mainstream users, advertisers, and businesses that seems unlikely.
While the EU’s DMA won’t be coming for Musk’s X anytime soon, the company does have plenty of regional compliance issues on its plate — including under the bloc’s Digital Services Act (DSA), a sister regulation to the DMA.
Under the DSA, X is expected to comply with general governance rules and an additional layer of requirements in areas like algorithmic transparency and accountability, which are reserved for larger platforms.
The Commission, which enforces these extra DSA rules on major platforms, already suspects X of a raft of DSA breaches and has several ongoing investigations that could lead to penalties of up to 6% of its global annual turnover if confirmed. So Musk’s penchant for insulting public officials could still come back to haunt him in the EU."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/airbnb-launches-a-network-that-lets-host-hire-other-hosts/,Airbnb launches a network that lets hosts hire other hosts | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-16,"Airbnb hosting has become a complicated business, from setting up a listing and managing the property to understanding price dynamics, communicating with customers, and tracking earnings. The tricky part is that the more properties hosts manage, the harder it becomes for them to juggle everything. To solve this problem, Airbnb is introducing the Co-Host Network feature, a place where hosts can find top-rated local co-hosts to help manage properties, as part of its winter release.
The travel company is setting up a LinkedIn- or Fiverr-like “hosts for hire” network consisting of highly rated local hosts. Currently, Airbnb has onboarded hosts with a rating of at least 4.8 and a minimum of 10 hosted stays. This company has onboarded 10,000 hosts onto the network in 10 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S.
These hosts can help with things like listing setup, setting prices and availability, booking request management, guest management, onsite guest support, and cleaning and maintenance. They can set up their own prices for offering these services. The host seeking these services can learn more about co-hosts, their skills related to co-hosting services, and their service rates on the profile page.
During Airbnb’s Summer 2023 product release, the company introduced features that allow hosts to add co-hosts to have them manage certain tasks. The release also had provisions to pay a percentage of booking to these co-hosts. The company is building a new network on those features.
“One of the requests that we had from hosts is that they would really love to be able to find professional, high-quality cohosts with a great track record in their area whom they can trust. And they can really be completely hands-off,” Judson Coplan, VP of Product Marketing at Airbnb, told TechCrunch.
Airbnb was touted as a passive income vehicle for the longest time. But with more travelers using different services, the expectations for bookings grew. As a result, hosts had to become professionals, and they also saw declining income from property booking. With this network rollout, Airbnb is giving hosts the opportunity to earn money when they are not managing their property.
The company said that hosts on the network currently help manage seven properties on average.
Besides introducing a co-host network, the company is rolling out a feature for hosts to see pricing for similar properties in the area, customizable templates for quick replies to guests, and an improved earnings dashboard.
The company is also releasing a slew of updates for guests such as a welcome tour in the app for first-time guests and suggested destinations, as well as filters in search, simpler checkout pages, and local payment options including Vipps in Norway, Mobile Pay in Denmark, and MoMo in Vietnam.
Besides these features, Judson also emphasized that the company is exploring using AI for community support when talking about the company’s AI strategy.
“When guests or hosts have questions about how to use the app, cancellations, policies, reservations, and bookings, I think AI can be a really valuable tool in getting answers quickly right in the app,” he said.
The company is already experimenting with using AI to summarize reviews and possibly build an “ultimate concierge” for customers."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/latticeflows-llm-framework-takes-a-first-stab-at-benchmarking-big-ais-compliance-with-eu-ai-act/,This LLM framework takes a first stab at benchmarking Big AI's compliance with the EU AI Act | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-16,"While most countries’ lawmakers are still discussing how to put guardrails around artificial intelligence, the European Union is ahead of the pack, having passed a risk-based framework for regulating AI apps earlier this year.
The law came into force in August, although full details of the pan-EU AI governance regime are still being worked out — Codes of Practice are in the process of being devised, for example. But, over the coming months and years, the law’s tiered provisions will start to apply on AI app and model makers so the compliance countdown is already live and ticking.
Evaluating whether and how AI models are meeting their legal obligations is the next challenge. Large language models (LLM), and other so-called foundation or general purpose AIs, will underpin most AI apps. So focusing assessment efforts at this layer of the AI stack seem important.
Step forward LatticeFlow AI, a spinout from public research university ETH Zurich, which is focused on AI risk management and compliance.
On Wednesday, it published what it’s touting as the first technical interpretation of the EU AI Act, meaning it’s sought to map regulatory requirements to technical ones, alongside an open source LLM validation framework that draws on this work — which it’s calling Compl-AI (“compl-ai”… see what they did there!).
The AI model evaluation initiative — which they also dub “the first regulation-oriented LLM benchmarking suite” — is the result of a long-term collaboration between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Bulgaria’s Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology (INSAIT), per LatticeFlow.
AI model makers can use the Compl-AI site to request an evaluation of their technology’s compliance with the requirements of the EU AI Act.
LatticeFlow has also published model evaluations of several mainstream LLMs, such as different versions/sizes of Meta’s Llama models and OpenAI’s GPT, along with an EU AI Act compliance leaderboard for Big AI.
The latter ranks the performance of models from the likes of Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral against the law’s requirements — on a scale of 0 (i.e. no compliance) to 1 (full compliance).
Other evaluations are marked as N/A where there’s a lack of data, or if the model maker doesn’t make the capability available. (NB: At the time of writing there were also some minus scores recorded but we’re told that was down to a bug in the Hugging Face interface.)
LatticeFlow’s framework evaluates LLM responses across 27 benchmarks such as “toxic completions of benign text,” “prejudiced answers,” “following harmful instructions,” “truthfulness,” and “common sense reasoning” to name a few of the benchmarking categories it’s using for the evaluations. So each model gets a range of scores in each column (or else N/A).
So how did major LLMs do? There is no overall model score. So performance varies depending on exactly what’s being evaluated — but there are some notable highs and lows across the various benchmarks.
For example there’s strong performance for all the models on not following harmful instructions; and relatively strong performance across the board on not producing prejudiced answers — whereas reasoning and general knowledge scores were a much more mixed bag.
Elsewhere, recommendation consistency, which the framework is using as a measure of fairness, was particularly poor for all models — with none scoring above the halfway mark (and most scoring well below).
Other areas, such as training data suitability and watermark reliability and robustness, appear essentially unevaluated on account of how many results are marked N/A.
LatticeFlow does note there are certain areas where models’ compliance is more challenging to evaluate, such as hot-button issues like copyright and privacy. So it’s not pretending it has all the answers.
In a paper detailing work on the framework, the scientists involved in the project highlight how most of the smaller models they evaluated (≤ 13B parameters) “scored poorly on technical robustness and safety.”
They also found that “almost all examined models struggle to achieve high levels of diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness.”
“We believe that these shortcomings are primarily due to model providers disproportionally focusing on improving model capabilities, at the expense of other important aspects highlighted by the EU AI Act’s regulatory requirements,” they add, suggesting that as compliance deadlines start to bite LLM makes will be forced to shift their focus onto areas of concern — “leading to a more balanced development of LLMs.”
Given no one yet knows exactly what will be required to comply with the EU AI Act, LatticeFlow’s framework is necessarily a work in progress. It is also only one interpretation of how the law’s requirements could be translated into technical outputs that can be benchmarked and compared. But it’s an interesting start on what will need to be an ongoing effort to probe powerful automation technologies and try to steer their developers toward safer utility.
“The framework is a first step towards a full compliance-centered evaluation of the EU AI Act — but is designed in a way to be easily updated to move in lock-step as the Act gets updated and the various working groups make progress,” LatticeFlow CEO Petar Tsankov told TechCrunch. “The EU Commission supports this. We expect the community and industry to continue to develop the framework towards a full and comprehensive AI Act assessment platform.”
Summarizing the main takeaways so far, Tsankov said it’s clear that AI models have “predominantly been optimized for capabilities rather than compliance.” He also flagged “notable performance gaps” — pointing out that some high capability models can be on a par with weaker models when it comes to compliance.
Cyberattack resilience (at the model level) and fairness are areas of particular concern, per Tsankov, with many models scoring below 50% for the former area.
“While Anthropic and OpenAI have successfully aligned their (closed) models to score against jailbreaks and prompt injections, open source vendors like Mistral have put less emphasis on this,” he said.
And with “most models” performing equally poorly on fairness benchmarks he suggested this should be a priority for future work.
On the challenges of benchmarking LLM performance in areas like copyright and privacy, Tsankov explained: “For copyright the challenge is that current benchmarks only check for copyright books. This approach has two major limitations: (i) it does not account for potential copyright violations involving materials other than these specific books, and (ii) it relies on quantifying model memorization, which is notoriously difficult.
“For privacy the challenge is similar: The benchmark only attempts to determine whether the model has memorized specific personal information.”
LatticeFlow is keen for the free and open source framework to be adopted and improved by the wider AI research community.
“We invite AI researchers, developers, and regulators to join us in advancing this evolving project,” said professor Martin Vechev of ETH Zurich and founder and scientific director at INSAIT, who is also involved in the work, in a statement. “We encourage other research groups and practitioners to contribute by refining the AI Act mapping, adding new benchmarks, and expanding this open-source framework.
“The methodology can also be extended to evaluate AI models against future regulatory acts beyond the EU AI Act, making it a valuable tool for organizations working across different jurisdictions.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/doctors-complain-of-it-in-the-stone-age/,Doctors complain of IT ‘in the stone age’ | TechCrunch,Ingrid Lunden,2024-10-16,"The United Kingdom’s NHS — the world’s largest public health service — is working on creaking IT infrastructure, doctors tell the Financial Times.
“I am at a top London hospital and yet at times I feel as though we are operating in the stone age,” one doctor tells the FT. For example, doctors email lists of patients to themselves to print out elsewhere. Some 13.5 million working hours are estimated to be lost annually due to inadequate IT systems.
There isn’t a complete absence of modern tech. NHS works with a long list of suppliers. It also began a relationship with Google’s DeepMind almost a decade ago. No doubt many others see opportunities to help. Dozens of companies are building AI-enabled “scribes” to help clinicians handle extensive admin work; AI is also being applied to drug discovery.
For now, however, one doctor, talking with the FT, compares the odds of an NHS hospital being properly equipped to a coin toss.
Much is at stake: Given the NHS holds medical records for nearly 67 million people, a breach could become a meltdown."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/octavia-gets-backing-to-remove-carbon-from-air/,Kenya's Octavia gets $3.9M seed to remove carbon from air | TechCrunch,Annie Njanja,2024-10-16,"As calls for urgent climate action persist, technologies to help remove the heat-trapping greenhouse gases from the atmosphere are also emerging globally.
In Africa, Octavia Carbon, a Direct Air Capture (DAC) startup, is leading the efforts. Octavia, founded in Kenya two years ago, builds DAC machines that it uses to capture carbon, a greenhouse gas that is the biggest contributor of global warming, from the air for storage underground.
Octavia, which began capturing carbon in February after a period of developing the tech, now plans to build more machines to add to its existing two devices with a carbon capture capacity of 50 tonnes per year. This comes as the startup plans to scale carbon removal in Kenya after closing a $3.9 million seed round and, it says, $1.1 million in the advance sale of carbon credits.
Octavia raised the equity funding in a round co-led by Lateral Frontiers and E4E Africa, with participation from Catalyst Fund, Launch Africa, Fondation Botnar, and Renew Capital.
Octavia’s co-founder and CEO Martin Freimüller, told TechCrunch the startup expects to reach a capture capacity of 1,500 tons per year beginning in 2025 when operating at capacity and a storage site run by partner company Cella Mineral Storage comes online.
“We’ve been developing the tech and now we’re taking it out of the lab for carbon removal at scale in the field,” said Freimüller, who co-founded the startup with Duncan Kariuki, a mechanical engineer.
Freimüller explained that while Octavia captures carbon from air and liquefies it, the startup has teamed up with Cella, a carbon sequestration startup that will inject it into the ground for storage.
Injection of the startup’s first batch of captured carbon is expected to happen before the year ends, and Freimüller said the project will be among the first ones in the world to turn captured carbon into rock underground.
“Once we have that liquid carbon dioxide, we give that to our storage partner, and they would sort of inject it underground at high pressures to seep into volcanic rock pores, and those are quite rich in calcium and magnesium that reacts with the CO2 to form carbonate minerals like calcium carbonate or limestone,” said Freimüller. “Naturally occurring materials, naturally occurring process and we’re just accelerating that in geologic areas where that hasn’t really happened over long periods of time.”
Kenya’s competitive edge
Freimüller said the geology of Kenya was one of the reasons the startup set up operations locally, explaining that the country’s Rift Valley region has the right rock formation for carbon storage.
“Kenya is really unique in having the East African Rift Valley, and that is really important for two reasons. The geology is great because it has porous rocks, volcanic rocks — specifically basalts . . . that actually can store CO2 underground. And the capacity of that geology is huge. You could store all of humanity’s cumulative CO2 to date in just Kenya, basically, because we have something like 8,600 cubic kilometers of that pore space in the East African Rift Valley,” he said.
Capturing carbon from air is also energy intensive, and for Octavia, the abundance of renewable energy, especially geothermal, in Kenya was the other factor that inspired the founders to set up operations in the East African country. They say using renewable energy gives Octavia a competitive edge over its peers in the developed world that use fossil fuels for their DAC operations, then buy renewable energy credits (which is counter-productive).
Globally, 27 DAC plants with capture capacity of 0.01 Mt CO2 per year have been commissioned in Europe, North America, Japan, and Middle East. Out of these plants, only Climeworks’ Orca plant in Iceland, which became operational in 2021; the Global thermostat headquarters plant in Colorado; and the Heirloom facility in California, both of which launched last year, currently capture more than 1,000 tons of CO2 per year.
More are expected as the industry grows. In fact, 130 DAC facilities are currently under development globally to capture 65 MtCO2 per year, a capacity needed by 2030 to realize net zero emissions by 2050.
Freimüller says it will not be an easy undertaking, but it is doable.
“Who would have thought that you can move an SUV around on batteries? That has been done too and that’s ultimately the power that engineering has to sort of change the perimeters within what’s possible,” he said.
Freimüller worked previously at Dalberg, a global consulting firm, focused on international development strategies. It’s where he first came across the massive opportunities that the climate sector presents.
His startup has since grown to a team of 60, 40 of whom are engineers doing research and development, with the others focusing on bench scale chemistry, which involves testing materials, methods, and chemical processes.
As Octavia, an Xprize Carbon Removal finalist, scales its operations, it aims to offer more DAC and storage carbon credits to grow its revenues. The startup says the Danish carbon removal marketplace Klimate is one of its largest clients, and that it has secured 12 altogether so far.
“For a deep tech company, it’s unusual to have that many customers at seed stage,” said Freimüller. “It took a lot of work to do to bring on these customers, but it’s also fair to say that there’s a lot of demand in the market for what we’re doing.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/long-careers-in-luxury-fashion-led-to-a-17m-raise-for-this-supply-chain-platform/,Long careers in luxury fashion led to a $17M raise for this supply chain platform | TechCrunch,Mike Butcher,2024-10-16,"The retail sector needs inventory planning to maintain margins and meet demand. This is getting harder because there are now many distribution channels, more complex supply chains, and shorter sales cycles. Mid-market retailers and premium brands have less firepower than the retail giants and tend to rely on legacy software.
Founded in 2020, Autone aims to forecast demand, and aid sales, while cutting waste and manual tasks.
The company has now raised a $17 million Series A funding round, led by General Catalyst. Previous investors also participated, including Speedinvest, Y Combinator, Seedcamp, 2100 Ventures, Motier, Financière Saint James, and angels from LVMH, Sephora, and Moncler. The new funding takes the total raised for the company to $20 million, including a $3 million seed round led by Speedinvest. Its competitors include Anaplan, Blue Yonder, and Relex.
Born and raised in Paris, Autone co-founder and CEO Adil Bouhdadi (pictured above, right) first got into sneaker culture in the early 2000s. Later, he wanted to enter the luxury fashion business, but with few connections, he decided to incessantly refresh the LVMH career website until an internship at Givenchy came up. He ended up spending six months shadowing the CEO.
After a Masters’ Degree in 2013, he got a break at Alexander Wang in New York, moved to Victoria Beckham in London, and joined Alexander McQueen in 2015.
While there, Bouhdadi and colleague Harry Glucksmann-Cheslaw (now Autone CTO) both worked on an internal inventory platform which, they claim, helped the brand’s revenue increase substantially over the following five years. The co-founders are a Muslim and Jewish pairing. Bouhdadi comes from a Muslim family (his parents moved to Paris from Morocco) and his co-founder comes from a Jewish family who moved to the U.K. to escape the Holocaust.
Bouhdadi (now CEO) told TechCrunch: “At Alexander McQueen we realized everyone in the company was just literally using Excel. The biggest pain point for any retail company is that they all operate in silos. We created the alpha version to Autone there.”
He said Autone can now look at a retail brand’s products in the next 12 months: “You can purchase raw materials in one month instead of three, reduce the inventory risk, and have a variable supply chain.”
Autone now counts companies such as Courreges, Roberto Cavalli, Stussy, and Zadig&Voltaire amongst its customer."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/support-automation-firm-capacity-grows-with-new-cash-and-acquisitions/,Support automation firm Capacity grows with new cash and acquisitions | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-16,"David Karandish has been busy.
Capacity, his support automation company, was planning a $5 million “bridge round” to help the company reach the break-even point. But TVC Capital, Toloka.vc, and the venture’s other backers had something grander in mind. So they threw in an additional $21 million for what became Capacity’s $26 million Series D.
While all this was happening, Capacity acquired three companies: enterprise search firm Lucy (which had raised $5.6 million) and two startups focused on customer service automation, Linc and Envision.
“It’s an exciting time of transformation at Capacity as we grow to help brands do more to automate interactions with customers and team members,” Karandish told TechCrunch. “We’re at an inflection point for AI and many businesses are realizing that they need a complete platform to be successful, rather than cobbling together a bunch of point solutions.”
Karandish co-founded Capacity with Chris Sims in 2017 as a part of Equity.com’s incubator program. After the $900 million exit of Answers.com (which Karandish also co-founded), Karandish says he wanted to start a business to address what he perceived as major blockers in customer service operations.
“Rising costs have placed pressure on support teams to do more with less,” Karandish said. “At the same time, consumer expectations are shifting rapidly where consumers both want self-service but are increasingly frustrated by lackluster experiences. Our goal with Capacity is to provide a great customer experience while also recognizing that escalating to a human is the right thing to do in many cases.”
Capacity connects to a company’s tech stack to answer queries and automate support tasks. The platform mines information from files, apps like Gmail, customer relationship management software, and more to build a knowledge base that Capacity’s chatbot and helpdesk tools can pull from.
Employees can ask Capacity’s chatbot questions like “What was added to the merger contract yesterday?,” or even instruct it to do things like updating the status of a sales lead. The chatbot and helpdesk can also deliver companywide announcements, like news and event notifications. And they can be made external-facing (with filters to hide sensitive data, mind you), embedded on a company’s website to answer common customer questions.
“We view Capacity as having the ease-of-use of a tool like Zendesk with the automation chops of a ServiceNow,” Karandish said. “From an approach standpoint, we are executing a very similar playbook to Parker Conrad’s ‘compound model’ — except in our case, we’re focused on support.”
Innovations in self-service software — including AI — are making them a more attractive solution to companies than they have been in the past. For example, Cleverly.ai — which Zendesk acquired in August 2022 — finds answers to customers’ questions by creating a knowledge layer on top of applications. Meanwhile, Directly taps algorithms trained by subject-matter experts to strategically answer customer issues in a variety of different messaging channels.
Customers like self-service options. According to a Zendesk poll, 67% prefer them over interacting with customer support. But it can be difficult to get them right. A Gartner survey found that, on average, only 14% of customer service and support issues are fully resolved in self-service.
Capacity will upgrade and expand its product portfolio through its recent acquisitions.
Karandish sees Lucy’s offering, which ingests and analyzes data from enterprise apps and systems, augmenting Capacity’s existing indexing technology. Envision, meanwhile, will help Capacity customers flag unresolved chats and calls and train human agents. And Linc will bring self-service tools for retail and e-commerce to Capacity, said Karandish.
The plan is for Lucy’s co-founders, Dan Mallin, Scott Litman, and Marc Dispensa, to join Capacity to help lead products and teams integration. Envision CEO Rodney Kuhn will oversee contact center solutions at Capacity, and Linc founder and CEO Fang Cheng will lead Capacity’s e-commerce efforts.
To date, Capacity has acquired eight companies — the other five being Textel, LumenVox, Denim Social, SmartAction, and CereProc — and raised more than $89 million.
Karandish said that the newest tranche will be put toward growing Capacity’s headcount to 200 people by the end of the year as the Saint Louis-based company “heads toward profitability.” Capacity’s customer base now stands at over 2,500 brands, he added, while its annual recurring revenue is nearly $50 million.
“Our growth strategy reflects what our customers are asking for: an all-in-one AI platform that delivers across all communication channels,” he added. “We’ve identified 24 steps of the customer experience that are ripe for support automation … Each acquisition adds specific tech and talent to help Capacity become a leading provider of AI-powered solutions for customer and employee experience.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/nordic-entrepreneur-led-vc-firm-node-vc-closes-e71-million-first-fund/,Nordic entrepreneur-led VC firm Node.vc closes €71M first fund | TechCrunch,Anna Heim,2024-10-16,"From Switzerland’s Founderful to Italian Founders Fund and the Dutch Operator Fund, a new crop of European VC firms claim to operate as “entrepreneurs backing entrepreneurs.”
Although it might still be early to call it a trend, Swedish fund Node.vc has now joined this group, with €71 million in funding to deploy into startups across the Nordics and Baltics.
“I hope it is a beginning trend,” Node.vc managing partner John Elvesjö told TechCrunch. “Europe has been significantly behind the U.S. when it comes to operational experience in VC investors. … There’s a lot of marketing around being founder-led and operator experience, but when you scratch the surface, it’s usually pretty thin.”
Node.vc’s ties to entrepreneurship run deeper than surface-level. That’s true of its investment team — Elvesjö (second-to-last on the right in the picture) co-founded Swedish eye-tracking startup Tobii, which went public in 2015. But that’s also true of its limited partners, which include 70 founders. While they have no obligation to add more than money, they have a natural penchant to invest their time, too.
However, Node.vc would likely have been unable to close a fund of this size if it hadn’t also secured institutional investors. Its LPs include Saminvest, Sweden’s fund-of-funds, and the life and pension arm of Nordic bank Nordea. That’s noteworthy for a first fund, and doubly so for one that takes an unusual approach to VC math.
“We have a team that is deliberately a bit oversized, meaning that we are more people on the team than what the fund can normally finance. And the reason for this is we are entrepreneurs and we are building a VC firm,” Elvesjö said.
With eight full-time and eight part-time staffers, several of whom previously worked at Nordic VC firm Brightly Ventures, Node.vc should have enough hands on deck for the seven startups it plans to back each year.
The rest of the equation is more typical for a fund of that size. “We write an average entry ticket of 1.3 million euro, and we can follow on for a very long time,” Elvesjö said. “We can actually invest even up to 10 million euro in one single company if we want.”
With three deals already, the fund is sector-agnostic but focuses on three themes. There’s future of entertainment, represented by portfolio company Roro, a gaming studio; future of work, with Lemonado and Starhive; and platform technologies, which include fintech, IoT, cloud infrastructure, and machine intelligence.
These themes correlate with the strengths and sectors the Nordics are known for, but Elvesjö and his partners only realized this after putting a significant amount of effort into research.
“We did this enormous investment in figuring out where trends are going, and then we condensed it and put it in a slide, and what the slide says is we think the Nordic ecosystem will be good at what it has been good at before,” he laughed.
Paradoxically, the fact that several Scandinavian unicorns let people go could also be beneficial for its startup scene. According to Elvesjö, “talent in the Nordics is more available than it’s been for the last five years.” That’s what makes Node.vc particularly bullish about its geography: AI tools are set to “disrupt pretty much every industry,” and the Nordics are “extremely well positioned to harvest this.”"

As a kind of apology for the nuisance, Waymo threw an ice cream party in Tung’s building and gave Tung, a software engineer, some promo codes redeemable for free rides.
The outfit may have underestimated her. After giving a few friends some codes, Tung — realizing the codes weren’t capped in value — determined she’d use her last one to ride in a Waymo for 24 hours, visiting tourist destinations like Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and Twin Peaks. Alas, 83 miles and 6.5 hours later, her Waymo ended the ride with 20 miles left, cutting short her plans.
It was seemingly for the best. Said Tung as she tried to regain feeling in her legs after the long ride, which ended back in her neighborhood: “Six hours and 30 minutes; I’m never doing that again.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/storio-is-deploying-the-battery-companions-of-solar-panels-on-industrial-sites/,Storio is helping other businesses unlock more value from solar energy | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-10-16,"Meet Storio, a French startup that’s focused on providing smart energy storage for commercial and industrial customers. Founded in 2023, the startup raised a €5 million seed round earlier this year (around $5.5 million at current exchange rates) and has signed its first client.
Storio believes solar panels have a bright future. But the company also wants every solar panel to come with a battery to optimize production. Its target customers are other businesses that may not feel they have the time or expertise to join all these technical pieces themselves.
Instead of building or selling stand-alone batteries, Storio has a more interesting distribution strategy: After performing a technical and revenue simulation, it partners with battery suppliers and civil engineering companies to turn a project into an energy storage installation.
Over the past few years, many commercial and industrial companies have built large solar panel installations to lower their electricity bills. Storio wants to complement (and tap into) these existing installations by offering an energy storage solution that can enable its customers to optimize their consumption of solar energy — thanks to Storio’s battery management software.
Once batteries are live, Storio remotely manages them to optimize consumption, as well as energy storage and release in general.
Typically, batteries are charged during the day and energy is released in the morning and evening — but Storio’s software allows for smarter stuff like price-conscious energy management.
“That’s the starting point. You have solar panels. Solar panels produce a lot of energy in the middle of the day. Let’s store it, so you can use it yourself and save money,” co-founder and CEO Jean-Yves Stephan told TechCrunch.
For example, Storio can charge batteries from the grid during off-peak hours so that a client doesn’t need to use as much electricity during peak times. As many industrial companies have suffered from expensive energy contracts over the past few years, partnering with Storio is a way to reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in the energy markets.
“The core of our value proposition is to optimize energy flows, either to create savings on our customer’s bill, or to generate additional income from the power grid,” Stephan said.
Storio batteries are also certified in France by Enedis and RTE to contribute to the stabilization of the grid. This means Storio can elect to release energy from the fleet of batteries it manages into the grid for a short period of time when there’s a demand peak — enabling it to generate revenue as a result of this contribution to the grid.
In this case it can even be more lucrative for a Storio customer to release energy from their batteries instead of consuming the energy themselves for their core business purpose.
“Stabilizing the network involves fairly technical mechanisms, such as stabilizing the network frequency. The grid frequency must be 50Hz [in Europe]. As it rises a little above or falls a little below, the battery reacts. It can also be used to buy and sell energy, like an ‘energy trader,’” Stephan added.
The energy trading part is an essential component of the startup’s proposition, as it can greatly reduce the time it takes to amortize a Storio installation.
The company estimates a customer can get a return on investment after five or six years — but batteries can last for up to 15 years (when they end up with roughly 70% of their initial capacity).
Storio and each industrial partner that hosts its battery management installation will have a profit-sharing agreement. “It’s very important to align interests because, as you say, we have to make some trade-offs. If we were saying ‘savings are for you, network revenues are for Storio,’ that would be unfair,” Stephan said.
Lowercarbon Capital is leading Storio’s seed funding round with Bpifrance’s Digital Venture fund also acquiring an equity stake in the startup. Kima Ventures and several business angels are also investing in the startup, including the founders of Bump, Electra, Elum Energy, Enspired, and Greenly.
Several other companies that have been working on on-site battery management include GridBeyond in the U.K., Stabl in Germany, and Stem in the U.S. As regulation varies from one region to another, Storio seems well positioned to tackle the French market and potentially other European countries in the future."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/former-palantir-ciso-dane-stuckey-joins-openai-to-lead-security/,Former Palantir CISO Dane Stuckey joins OpenAI to lead security | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-16,"Dane Stuckey, the former CISO of analytics firm Palantir, has joined OpenAI as its newest CISO, serving alongside OpenAI head of security Matt Knight.
Stuckey announced the move in a post on X Tuesday evening.
“Security is germane to OpenAI’s mission,” he said. “It is critical we meet the highest standards for compliance, trust, and security to protect hundreds of millions of users of our products, enable democratic institutions to maximally benefit from these technologies, and drive the development of safe AGI for the world. I am so excited for this next chapter, and can’t wait to help secure a future where AI benefits us all.”
Stuckey started at Palantir in 2014 on the information security team as a detection engineering and incident response lead. Prior to joining Palantir, Stuckey spent over a decade in various commercial, government, and intelligence community digital forensics, incident detection/response, and security program development roles, according to his blog.
Stuckey’s work at Palantir, an AI company rich in government contracts, could perhaps help advance OpenAI’s ambitions in this area. Forbes reports that, through its partner Carahsoft, a government contractor, OpenAI is seeking to establish a closer relationship with the U.S. Department of Defense.
Since it lifted its ban on selling AI tech to the military in January, OpenAI has worked with the Pentagon on several software projects, including ones related to cybersecurity. It’s also appointed former head of the National Security Agency, retired Gen. Paul Nakasone, as a board member.
OpenAI has been beefing up the security side of its operation in recent months.
Several weeks ago, the company posted a job listing for a head of trusted compute and cryptography to lead a new team focused on building “secure AI infrastructure.” This infrastructure would entail capabilities to protect AI tech, security tool evaluations, and access controls “that advance AI security,” per the description."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/our-favorite-startups-from-pear-vcs-invitational-demo-day/,Our favorite startups from Pear VC's invitational demo day | TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,2024-10-15,"Pear VC, a prominent pre-seed and seed-focused venture firm, has been running an accelerator for about a decade with  about 10 startups in each batch.
Over those years, the small but mighty program has helped launch numerous companies like Viz.ai, whose FDA-approved AI can diagnose strokes (and was valued at $1.2 billion in 2022); relationship management company Affinity, which raised an $80 million Series C at a $620 million valuation, according to PitchBook data; and Valar Labs, which uses AI to help doctors make cancer-treatment decisions (it closed a $22 million Series A in May).
This year, Pear has decided that it’s time to grow the size of its accelerator and provide the companies more services by offering them recruiting help and space inside its new 30,000-square-foot San Francisco office. Going forward, the 14-week program, now called PearX, will run twice a year. Each batch will consist of approximately 20 companies. The larger program is still a far cry from Y Combinator’s, which accepts hundreds of startups annually.
It’s not just the smaller size that distinguishes PearX from YC. The startups in each batch are usually not revealed until the demo day, an in-person event attended by over a hundred VC general partners, including from top firms such as Sequoia, Benchmark, and Index Ventures. While YC says that it offers each company the same standard terms, the funding PearX startups receive from the firm can range from $250,000 to $2 million, depending on needs and stage of development.
This year’s demo day, which took place earlier this month, included 20 companies, most of which focused on AI. Among them, here are five that stood out to us and the crowd in attendance with fresh approaches to complex business problems.
Neutrino AI
What it does: Identifies best infrastructure for multi-model AI applications.
Why it stood out: AI companies want to make sure they’re using the best tools for the job. Figuring out which large language models (LLMs) or small language models are best for each application can be time-consuming, especially since these models are constantly changing and improving.
Neutrino wants to make it easier for AI companies to find the right mix of models and other systems to use in their applications. This way, developers can work faster and save money on running their products.
Quno AI
What it does: Automates market research.
Why it stood out: Brands spend millions each year on market research. The process of surveying potential customers is time-consuming. Quno AI’s agents can call customers and gather qualitative and quantitative data. Results can then be analyzed in real time. A bonus is that AI can quickly analyze results from these conversations.
ResiQuant
What it does: Develops catastrophe models for home insurance carriers.
Why it stood out: With natural disasters on the rise, property insurance companies are struggling to figure out which houses are at the highest risk of suffering significant damage during catastrophes. That’s because access to information about home structures is difficult and expensive to obtain.
Founded by two PhDs in structural engineering, ResiQuant is creating models to estimate building features and how they’ll hold up during earthquakes, hurricanes, and fires. The company claims it can help insurance carriers assess risk more accurately, potentially lowering homeowner insurance premiums for those deemed to be lower-risk.
Self Eval
What it does: Monitors real-world production and alerts operators of mistakes.
Why it stood out: In January, the doors of a Boeing 737 Max blew out midflight because four important bolts were missing, according to investigators. That situation is just one high-profile example of what can go awry within quality-assurance systems. But manufacturers of all sorts of products have similar needs to detect defective products before they leave the factory.
Using cameras and AI, Self Eval hopes to address such concerns by verifying that tasks are completed correctly, flagging manufacturing errors in real time.
TeachShare
What it does: Creates lesson plans adapted for each teacher’s needs.
Why it stood out: Software that adjusts difficulty based on individual student knowledge has been available for some time. However, TeachShare’s founders argue that many educational companies still offer a one-size-fits-all approach to curriculum development. This forces teachers to spend significant time modifying lesson plans to suit their specific classrooms. TeachShare aims to assist teachers in tailoring daily content, ensuring alignment with educational standards."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/how-teslas-plans-for-unsupervised-fsd-and-robotaxis-could-run-into-red-tape/,How Tesla's plans for 'unsupervised FSD' and robotaxis could run into red tape | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-10-15,"During Tesla’s much-hyped robotaxi reveal event last week, CEO Elon Musk said he expects Tesla to release an “unsupervised” version of FSD, the automaker’s advanced driver assistance system, in Texas and California in 2025 on certain Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.
He also said Tesla would begin production on its robotaxis — which are built without a steering wheel or pedals — by 2026 or 2027.
While we’re skeptical about Musk’s ability to stick to a timeline, the rollout of both unsupervised FSD and robotaxis built without human controls brings up regulatory concerns.
Let’s break this down, shall we?
FSD stands for “Full Self-Driving,” but the technology is not yet capable of full autonomy. However, it can perform certain automated driving tasks in cities and on highways. After being accused of false advertising for the misnomer, the company changed the branding of FSD from “FSD Beta” to “FSD Supervised” in April. This name change more accurately reflects the fact that a human driver still must remain attentive behind the wheel and take over if needed.
We think “unsupervised FSD” can mean one of two things: either a completely driverless Level 4 system or a “hands-off, eyes-off” Level 3 system like Mercedes’ Drive Pilot or the one that General Motors is working on. (Level 4 is fully autonomous under predefined conditions, while Level 3 means a human driver must occasionally take over if the system requests it.)
Tesla said it plans to launch an unsupervised version of its expensive software in California and Texas next year. Musk didn’t say whether this would just be an over-the-air update or if customers will have to shell out extra cash for the more advanced technology.
Either way, Tesla could likely send software updates to Model Ys and Model 3s in Texas, where its headquarters are, next year with little regulatory oversight. Texas’ autonomous vehicle regulations basically allow companies to deploy AVs with or without a human driver present as long as the vehicle can comply with traffic and motor vehicle laws, is equipped with a recording device, is registered, and is covered by motor vehicle liability insurance.
That said, in 2025, the state legislature might have to weigh in on proposed bills that would require AV companies to notify the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles when human drivers step out, among other measures.
In California, the process is not that simple, as the state’s DMV has several permits.
Tesla, alongside more than 30 other companies, already has a drivered testing permit that allows it to test autonomous technology with a safety driver on public roads. A California DMV spokesperson told TechCrunch that Tesla has held this permit since 2015, and the company last reported using it in 2019.
“Tesla does not have, nor has Tesla applied for, a driverless testing or deployment permit,” Chris Orrock, public information officer at the CA DMV, told TechCrunch. “If Tesla plans to expand its permitted test fleet in California, Tesla would be required to identify the vehicles being tested (year, make, model, etc.) and apply to add the new vehicles to their permit. They would also need to update the permit with drivers performing the tests.”
A “driverless testing” permit allows companies to test their autonomous vehicles on public roads with no driver in the front seat, and a “deployment permit” allows companies to deploy the vehicles commercially, but only for non-passenger-carrying activities like food delivery.
If “unsupervised FSD” means Tesla plans to release a Level 3 system next year, it would only need to acquire a deployment permit. But if it plans to roll out a Level 4 system like Waymo currently operates in several cities – which industry experts tell TechCrunch is unlikely to happen by next year – then the company would need to apply for both a driverless testing and then a deployment permit.
For Tesla to get into the ride-hail business and charge passengers a fare, it would need to secure another set of permits with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The agency did not confirm whether Tesla has begun the application process.
Mercedes is the only automaker with a permit to operate its Level 3 Drive Pilot system in California, but it’s under strict conditions. Vehicles equipped with the software can drive only freeways and highways (not surface streets) in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Diego. They can drive only during the daytime and in sufficient weather conditions — meaning, no flooded highways or snowstorms — and at a speed of 40 miles per hour. So basically, they’re going to be most useful when you’re sitting in traffic on the highway and would rather be using that time to check your email or scroll Instagram.
Then there are Musk’s claims that Tesla will start production of its robotaxi by 2027 at the latest. (Reminder: Musk claimed in 2019 that Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020, and Musk claimed in 2022 that Tesla would be mass producing the robotaxis by 2024.)
Whether Tesla hits this deadline by 2027 or not, federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) might hold up any rollout of the vehicles, which are currently envisioned to have no steering wheel or pedals.
If Tesla wants to mass-produce its robotaxis with no traditional driver controls, it needs to obtain an exemption from the FMVSS.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) confirmed to TechCrunch that Tesla has not applied for any exemptions for its driverless Cybercab.
To date, the NHTSA has granted only one such exemption to Nuro to produce its R2 low-speed autonomous delivery vehicles, because they are not designed to carry human passengers.
General Motors requested an exemption to mass-produce Cruise’s Origin vehicles in 2021, but never received it, and has since scrapped those plans. Amazon’s Zoox is also holding out for exemptions for its robotaxi — it has been granted approvals for testing but not full-scale production.
The NHTSA was expected to announce a new rule-making to accommodate AVs built without human controls, or even things like windshield wipers, in September 2023, but that rule-making has been delayed. The agency told TechCrunch it was working to publish the proposed rule “soon.”
It’s this kind of tricky regulatory landscape — and Musk’s lack of clarification around how Tesla plans to navigate such regulations, how Tesla’s FSD tech has advanced, and more details on the automaker’s go-to-market strategy — that had investors spooked after the company’s splashy event last week. Tesla’s stock fell nearly 10% Friday and hasn’t yet fully recovered.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/white-house-considers-expanding-nvidia-and-amds-ai-chip-export-limits-to-additional-countries/,White House considers expanding Nvidia's and AMD's AI chip export limits to additional countries | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-10-15,"The Biden administration has privately discussed capping sales of advanced AI chips from Nvidia and AMD to certain Persian Gulf countries in the interest of national security, Bloomberg reported on Monday. The restriction could put a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries, potentially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are heavily investing in AI data centers.
The White House increasingly views American AI chips as a key advantage on the global stage. Last year, the United States banned the sale of Nvidia’s and AMD’s advanced AI chips to China, and placed export restrictions on 40 other countries around the globe to close loopholes where AI chips could indirectly get to China.
The latest reported discussions could indicate that U.S. officials are worried about the Persian Gulf’s global influence over the AI industry. This year, Saudi Arabia reportedly planned to launch a $40 billion fund to invest in AI technology, while OpenAI reportedly held discussions with a UAE-backed investment fund over participating in its latest $6.6 billion funding round."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/elon-musks-x-still-struggles-to-grow-subscription-revenue/,Elon Musk's X still struggles to grow subscription revenue | TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,2024-10-15,"Elon Musk’s plan to reduce X’s dependence on advertising revenue by increasing paid subscriptions is still not taking off. According to a new, third-party analysis of the X Premium subscription service by app intelligence firm Appfigures, X has pulled in approximately $200 million in in-app purchase revenue across iOS and Android since the original 2021 launch of the subscription formerly known as Twitter Blue.
There are some caveats to this figure. For starters, the sum is based only on those purchases made via the mobile app, not the mobile web or desktop web. That means the true sum is likely higher, especially given X offers a discount for web purchases.
Then there are the commission fees to consider.
After paying app store commissions, X will have made a minimum of $140 million, the firm estimates. However, that figure will also likely be higher because Apple and Google discount commissions from 30% to 15% in year two. (Appfigures doesn’t have a way to reliably calculate how many subscriptions are associated with each commission rate, we’re told).
For further context, though Twitter Blue was launched in 2021, it was relaunched in December 2022 as Twitter under Musk pushed into non-advertising revenue. Within the first three months post-relaunch, the service brought in only $11 million in mobile app subscriptions, per data from app data provider Sensor Tower. A year ago, the company now called X launched two additional subscriptions, Basic and Premium+.
While there’s no way to definitively determine how many of X’s users are paying for X Premium subscriptions, there are ways to back into some estimates here, at least in terms of native mobile subscribers.
Currently, X continues to offer three subscription tiers: Basic, Premium, and Premium Plus with varying access to advanced features, like Grok AI, a blue Verified checkmark, and fewer ads, among others. The top in-app purchase (based on App Store data) is X Premium, which costs $11 per month on mobile.
In September 2024, X grossed $14.7 million through in-app purchases on mobile devices, according to Appfigures.
Since X is a private company with no obligation to share its user numbers publicly, one can only guess how many people are buying which subscription tier.
But if that revenue was generated mostly by its top in-app purchase, X Premium, that would equate to roughly 1.3 million paying users (i.e., $14.7M / $11).
If, instead, all the sign-ups were for X’s lowest tier, the $4 per month X Basic, then X could have gained as many as 3.7 million paid users during the month.
If we were to estimate that X’s paid users broke down by 70% on Premium, 20% on Premium Plus, and 10% on Premium Basic, that would equate to about 940,000 Premium users, 134,000 Premium Plus users, and 368,000 Premium Basic users. This split seems reasonable since X’s top three subscriptions (in order) are Premium, Premium Plus, then Basic. In total, those numbers combined would come to around 1.4 million paid users added during September.
Quarter by quarter, the picture does look a bit rosier for X Premium, as Appfigures’ estimates indicate that in-app purchase revenue growth jumped 30% from Q2 to Q3 after staying relatively flat in the prior period.
There are other in-app purchases available beyond X Premium to consider, like those for subscriptions to top creators on the platform. Elon Musk has a large following, for instance. Fortune reported last year that Musk was the most-followed user with 155 million followers, of which over 40,000 were subscribers — or .025% of his followers had subscribed. Today, Musk has 200 million followers. Assuming roughly the same percentage was subscribed, that would work out to around 50,000 subscribers. At $4 per month for the subscription, that would pull in around $200,000 per month in gross revenue.
Another user with a large subscription base is @stevewilldoit, as he follows anyone who subscribes to him. He currently follows 10,400 people on X. If three-fourths were subscribed, that would equal around 7,800 subscribers paying $5 per month, bringing in gross earnings of $39,000/month before X’s cut is removed.
Though rough estimates, these additional figures are also important because they’re a part of X’s plan to grow its user base via creator content.
Last week, the company announced it would begin to pay creators based on engagement they receive from X’s Premium subscribers, instead of a cut of ad revenue — a change clearly meant to boost X subscribers. On the one hand, given that X had reduced the ad load for Premium+ subscribers to zero, this could open up more possibilities for creators to make money. But paying for engagement also often incentivizes clickbait or controversial content, designed to get replies.
Regardless, Bloomberg reported earlier this year that X generated $1.48 billion in total revenue during the first 6 months of 2024, according to financial documents shared with regulators. In other words, subscriptions are still a very small piece of X’s pie.
The introduction of the new program followed moves from X that alienated some advertisers, such as suing a group over their ad boycott and CEO Elon Musk telling advertisers to “go f— yourself.” The company has since been trying to make amends, recently forging a deal to bring Unilever back into the fold."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/internal-blog-post-reveals-automattics-plan-to-enforce-the-wordpress-trademark-using-nice-and-not-nice-lawyers/,Internal blog post reveals Automattic's plan to enforce the WordPress trademark using 'nice and not nice lawyers' | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-15,"Matt Mullenweg, the WordPress co-founder and Automattic CEO, has been embroiled in a very public and legal fight with WP Engine these last few weeks over the use of WordPress as a trademark and fees Automattic believes WP Engine owes to the WordPress project — sparring that has resulted in WP Engine issuing legal demands of its own.
But Automattic’s position on the matter did not materialize overnight.
According to an internal blog post a source shared with TechCrunch, Automattic was crafting a plan to get significantly stricter about trademark enforcement across WordPress and its e-commerce platform WooCommerce since at least the beginning of the year. Separate sources have confirmed the authenticity of the post.
The message — penned by Automattic’s then-chief legal officer Paul Sieminski in January 2024 on the company’s “P2” (a version of WordPress aimed at internal communications) — outlined a plan for how Automattic would approach this strategy, through direct negotiations with companies and via legal action from “nice and not nice lawyers and trademark enforcers.” And Automattic potentially would register further trademarks going forward.
“We will be using a multi-pronged strategy that will involve some additional trademark registrations … legal cease-and-desist letters, and a formal paid licensing program for the partners,” Sieminski noted. (He left the company in April 2024.)
This is effectively what has played out.
In July, the WordPress Foundation filed trademark applications for both “Managed WordPress” and “Hosted WordPress,” which are pending in status. And Automattic issued a cease-and-desist letter to WP Engine at the end of last month. Neither Automattic nor the WordPress Foundation has yet to publish any further guidance, however, on fair use.
The WordPress Foundation, a nonprofit, has owned the trademark for WordPress since 2010, when Mullenweg founded Automattic as a commercial entity to sit on top of the open source framework.
Mullenweg’s reasoning for transferring that trademark to the foundation was that, even if there were a changing of the guard at Automattic, the trademark would remain safe with the foundation and the open source project could live on.
Automattic holds the exclusive commercial license for WordPress, and its recent actions signal a major shift in how it’s positioning itself as a guardian.
In addition to giving some context to Automattic’s recent legal actions, the internal blog post also underscores how tension has escalated in the WordPress ecosystem, where the collaborative aspects of open source projects have had to be balanced against business interests.
Many contributors and developers have pointed out how this fight could negatively impact the WordPress community. That would be a change from past form since Automattic previously appeared to have a less adversarial relationship with prominent players in the ecosystem. It had even been an investor in WP Engine to spur more ecosystem activity. It was bought out, we have learned and confirmed, when Silverlake took a controlling stake in WP Engine in 2018.The internal post — which only refers to Automattic, no mention of WP Engine or other companies building on the WordPress framework — is primarily focused on the “WordPress” trademark, including its circular logo. Sieminski emphasized Automattic is the only company allowed to use these in its name and branding.
He also clarified Automattic’s role around WordPress.org. The initiative “doesn’t involve creating or explaining any new rules” beyond its trademark policy, he writes.
Google also makes an appearance in the post — primarily as a vehicle for enabling abuse of the trademark.
“A brief perusal of Google Ads and hosting company landing pages will turn up a lot of ‘Managed WordPress,’ or companies that offer ‘WordPress Hosting.’” he wrote. “Is this OK? Can we clamp down on these things? The answers are … no, and yes.”
Automattic, he wrote, would seek to work with Google to keep it from amplifying companies and links that misused the branding. “Overall, they can help but we cannot rely on them 100%,” he added.
The post covers trademarks related to WooCommerce, Automattic’s Shopify competitor that it acquired in 2015. WooCommerce is 100% owned by Automattic, and Automattic is following the same enforcement strategy for it and its “Woo” branding. Enforcement, the counsel wrote in the internal blog post, “will probably be easier and cleaner because it’s less of a community asset.” (WooCommerce itself is also open source.)
There are some murky areas in the dispute that Automattic has with WP Engine and WordPress trademark enforcement. One of these concerns the trademarks that were filed in July 2024. In a conversation with TechCrunch last month, Mullenweg claimed he didn’t know who filed these on behalf of the Foundation, or why. He said that he doesn’t know about day-to-day operations of the Foundation and volunteers are the ones who handle it.
The Foundation has three directors, including Mullenweg. The others are Mark Ghosh, who sold his website, a popular WordPress blog, to Mullenweg in 2014, and Chele Farley, a former Republican politician whose campaign Mullenweg lent money to. Both of them have been almost invisible from Foundation activities or speaking about the WordPress ecosystem.
For now, the focus of the dispute has been between Mullenweg and WP Engine. “If there are violations of the trademark, of course, we need to enforce our trademark. I’m not aware of any others that are as egregious or as harmful as WP Engine,” Mullenweg told TechCrunch in late September.
We reached out to Automattic for comment for this story and Mullenweg replied directly. He did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the dispute with WP Engine was a one-off or setting a precedent for further action.
“We do trademark enforcement all the time! It’s part of protecting the trademark,” he wrote. “Usually it’s pretty minor, and a UDRP or email takes care of it. However, WP Engine’s misuse of the WordPress and WooCommerce trademarks was so intrinsic to their business it required a more substantive deal, which I honestly thought was going to happen (it makes sense, from a business point of view) prior to [the September WordPress conference] WordCamp, which is why we allowed them to sponsor [the U.S. event].”
He added that the company was “upgrading a lot of our legal team right now.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/some-americans-are-still-using-kasperskys-antivirus-despite-u-s-government-ban/,Some Americans are still using Kaspersky's antivirus despite US government ban | TechCrunch,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-10-15,"At the end of September, Kaspersky forcibly uninstalled and replaced itself with a new antivirus called UltraAV on the computers of around a million Americans, many of whom were surprised and aghast that they were not asked to give their consent for the change. The move was the end result of the U.S. government ban on all sales of Kaspersky software in the country and — at least in theory — marked the end of Kaspersky in America.
But not everyone in the U.S. has given up on the Russian-made antivirus. Some Americans have found ways to get around the ban and are still using Kaspersky’s antivirus, TechCrunch has learned.
Several people who live in the U.S. said in posts on Reddit that they are holding out as Kaspersky customers. When TechCrunch asked them about their motivations, their reasons range from being skeptical of the reasons behind the ban, or having paid for the product already, to simply preferring the product over its rivals.
“It’s well-known to be the best [antivirus] in the world and has a long track record. There’s 0 actual evidence of it being ‘spyware’ and I can’t just blindly believe something that has no evidence supporting it,” a U.S.-based Reddit user who goes by Blippyz told TechCrunch in a direct message.
Another Reddit user, nicknamed YouKnowWho_13, who continues to use Kaspersky antivirus from New York, said they are not worried about the allegations that Kaspersky has abused its access to some Americans’ computers to siphon off sensitive data back to the Russian government.
“Hey I’m just a cashier…,” they told TechCrunch, implying that they are not an interesting target for cyber spies and adding that the ban on Kaspersky sales was “a bit too harsh” and unnecessary. “[I] used it for 10 years. Force of habit haha. It’s a nice product.”
The way these users are getting around the sales ban is twofold. First, they purchased their license or key prior to the ban, meaning they haven’t violated the sales ban and sanctions by sending money to the Moscow-based cybersecurity company. Second, they use a VPN or have manually added a non-U.S. server to the list of update servers, which means that in the eyes of Kaspersky, they effectively are not U.S. users.
Kaspersky did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.
Avi Fleischer, a long-time Kaspersky user who lives in Brooklyn, New York, told TechCrunch that he is also still using the software on his home computer. Fleischer explained that once the ban came into full effect, the “Kaspersky Security Network” — a service “designed to receive and process complex global cyberthreat data”  — became unavailable, but he was able to still get updates for virus definitions by pointing the update server to one outside the United States.
“And now it’s able to update the virus definitions automatically,” Fleischer said, adding that he is not using a VPN.
YouKnowWho_13 said they bought an international license key off of eBay. Like others, they said they added an update server that’s outside of the United States in the Kaspersky app to continue receiving security updates.
Once their license key expires, YouKnowWho_13 said they will switch to antivirus competitors ESET or Bitdefender.
Another Reddit user, Das1996, told TechCrunch that they are using a VPN to get updates and have a license key that expires in around three or four months. Once that happens, they said, they will decide what to do. But “if the VPN option works well, I’ll continue to use ’em,” said Das1996.
Domingothegamer, a Reddit user who sought help on the website when they couldn’t update their Kaspersky software, said that they still have a three-year license, with two years left, for 10 devices. For them, leaving Kaspersky “feels like a big waste just because of the ban.”
They said they don’t even need to use a VPN, and that apart from adding new servers to get the updates, “it’s just a service like usual.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/google-adds-new-features-for-pixel-along-with-android-15-and-theft-detection-roll-out/,Google adds new features for Pixel along with Android 15 rollout | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-15,"Google is rolling out Android 15 today to Pixel devices. It is also adding new features through the October Pixel drop, including improved low-light photography on Instagram and support for underwater photography and video.
Android 15 has a private space feature that lets you hide and lock apps behind a separate PIN or biometric lock — much like iOS 18’s hide and lock app feature.
The new software update also has new theft protection measures, such as requiring additional authentication if someone tries to remove your SIM or turn off Find My Device. Plus, after multiple failed tries to change sensitive settings by guessing your password or PIN, the system will lock down the device.
Android 15 also brings features like a taskbar with the ability to pin apps and app pairs for split screen for foldable and tablets. It also adds support for single-tap login for saved passkeys and satellite messaging when there is no network or Wi-Fi connection.
The October Pixel drop brings improvements for low-light photography directly on Instagram for all Pixel devices starting from Pixel 6 (excluding Pixel A series).
Google added an Audio Magic Eraser feature to the Pixel 8 series — it gives users the ability to turn down the volume of certain sounds. The new Pixel drop also allows them to turn the volume of different sources up and down. Plus, users can also turn the volume of various people in the video up and down.
The company is also rolling out theft protection measures for Pixel 6 and newer devices that include automatically locking your phone when someone tries to snatch it away from you. Google said it uses AI to detect this motion when someone snatches the phone and runs, bikes, or drives away.
Additionally, the company is bringing features like theft detection locks to all devices running Android 10 and above.
All Pixel devices from Pixel 6 and newer get widget recommendations; the new updated Pixel weather app; pollen data tracking in France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K.; call screening in the U.K. and Japan; Gemini Live support for audio AI conversations in France, Germany, Brazil, India, Spain, and Latin America; and easier access to the Astrophotography mode with a slide button in the Night Sight mode.
With the October Pixel Drop, Pixel 9 series owners can use a waterproof case to capture videos and photos underwater while snorkeling or swimming. The company said it is making updates to the camera app to represent better colors while shooting underwater. The Pixel 9 also gets support for Gemini Extension for Pixel screenshots, so you can call on Gemini to find something from your library of screenshots.
Google is rolling out the ability to talk to Gemini without taking out your phone if you have the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Pixel Buds Pro, Pixel Buds A-Series, and the original Pixel Buds.
The company is adding screensavers with home controls, screensavers with clocks, and the ability to share, favorite, or archive photos from the photo frame screensaver on the Pixel tablet. In the coming weeks, it will also roll out the ability to transfer media — such as a Spotify track or a YouTube video — seamlessly to a Pixel tablet from the Pixel 6 Pro, the Pixel 7 Pro, the Pixel Fold, the Pixel 8 Pro, the Pixel 9 Pro, the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.
Additionally, Google is bringing emoji email reactions and an updated contact app with easier access to favorite contact to all Pixel watches."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/instagrams-latest-feature-is-a-digital-business-card-for-your-profile/,Instagram’s latest feature is a digital business card for your profile | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-15,"Instagram is rolling out a new “profile card” feature that is essentially a digital business card for your profile. The official launch comes a few months after the Meta-owned social network was spotted testing the feature with select creators.
The new two-sided profile cards are designed to make it easier for users to share their Instagram account with others, as you don’t have to send your handle to someone, you can just share the card with them. Instagram sees the feature as an easier way to connect with new people and make friends.
One side is a shareable “card” that pulls information from your Instagram profile, such as your bio, profile picture, and any links or music that you have in your profile. The other side features a QR code that links to your profile. You can customize the background of your profile card with an image of your choosing to better express yourself.
The feature, rolling out to all users globally, is geared toward people who want to market themselves and grow their connections. You can share your profile card on other platforms to encourage people to check out your account and follow you.
Meta told TechCrunch in an email that it’s launching the feature in response to more Gen Zers using their Instagram as a resume of sorts. The company pointed to a recent survey that found that more than half of Gen Zers want to become influencers, which is why the social network is looking to help them present themselves to others.
Instagram says users can share their profile cards with potential collaborators or brands in a quick and easy way. The company also believes the feature can be used to make new friends who share similar interests by sharing the profile card in Instagram groups or online events.
Although Instagram has allowed users to share their accounts via QR codes since 2018, the new profile cards offer a more detailed way of doing so. Instead of just displaying a simple QR code, you can give others a bit of a look into your interests and content, which could lead to more connections than a standard QR code would."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/new-york-times-sends-perplexity-cease-and-desist-letter-demands-it-stops-using-its-content-in-ai-summaries/,The New York Times has had it with generative AI companies using its content  | TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,2024-10-15,"The New York Times sent a cease and desist letter demanding that Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity stop accessing and using its content in AI summaries and other output. The Wall Street Journal reviewed the document.
The letter argues that Perplexity has been “unjustly enriched” by using the publisher’s “expressive, carefully written and researched, and edited journalism without a license,” which it says violates copyright laws.
This isn’t the paper’s first tangle with AI companies — it’s suing OpenAI for using content without consent to train ChatGPT. Other publishers have also accused Perplexity of unethical web scraping.
A recent study from Copyleaks, a tool to check for plagiarism and AI-generated content, found that Perplexity was able to summarize paywalled content from publishers.
Perplexity recently launched an ad-revenue share scheme to give some money back to publishers.
Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas told WSJ the startup is interested in working with the NYT, stating, “We have no interest in being anyone’s antagonist here.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/india-backs-musk-in-satellite-spectrum-allocation-row/,India backs Musk in satellite spectrum allocation row | TechCrunch,"Manish Singh, Jagmeet Singh",2024-10-15,"The long-running debate over how satellite spectrum would be allocated in India appeared to reach an important milestone on Tuesday: India announced it would allocate spectrum for satellite services through administrative means — essentially setting a price that is payable first-come, first-served — rather than auction.
Jyotiraditya Scindia, India’s Communications Minister, stated on Tuesday evening: “Spectrum for satcomm is shared spectrum, and cannot be auctioned. The administrative allocation of satellite spectrum is practiced worldwide.”
The issue is significant not just because it helps decide how to divvy up important, finite, spectrum for new communications services, but because it will likely signal the entry of Elon Musk and his Starlink satellite services into India’s lucrative telecom market. Amazon’s Project Kuiper — which is also looking to enter India’s broadband market — is another new player that has advocated for shared spectrum allocation.
On the other side of the debate, Indian telcos arguably have been trying to restrict his ambitious plans by supporting the idea of an auction. One of the more prominent voices has been Reliance Jio, led by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, which has pushed for auctions to ensure a “level playing field”.
Sunil Mittal, co-chair of Eutelsat and chair of Bharti Airtel, has been another vocal advocate of the auction route. Earlier on Tuesday, he argued that satellite companies serving urban areas should “take the telecom licenses like everybody else” and buy spectrum accordingly.
“Therefore, mobile operators and satcom operators, who have worked in harmony for decades, can continue to do so to serve those who are still struggling to find internet connectivity,” Airtel said in a statement released following Mittal’s comments.
Musk had warned on Monday that instituting satellite spectrum auctions “would be unprecedented“, citing long-standing ITU designations of shared satellite spectrum.
India is the world’s most populous country with over 1.4 billion people, but it still has a long way to go in terms of closing up its digital divide. There are currently 950 million internet users, meaning that a full 490 million – more than one-third of the population – are still unconnected. This highlights the need to explore new avenues. Although satellite broadband is generally a more expensive option for mobile services, it’s also been seen as a strong contender for expanding connectivity in areas where there is no infrastructure in place today, or used as a backhaul route to extend the capacity of terrestrial mobile networks.
Historically, Jio and Airtel have led the telecom sector in India by offering their network across a range of network frequencies. The duo has also been exploring satellite broadband for some months to take on global players like Starlink and Amazon.
Jio, India’s biggest telco operator, partnered with the Luxembourg-based satellite communications service provider SES for its joint venture in 2022. The venture, named Orbit Connect, received rights and market access authorizations from the space industry regulator, IN-SPACe, earlier this year. The operator also showcased its satellite broadband service called JioSpaceFiber last year, which it said would offer high-speed internet access across the country “at highly affordable prices.”
Like Jio, Airtel has OneWeb India, a local subsidiary of low-earth orbit operator Eutelsat OneWeb, to look into its ambitious plans to offer satellite broadband services in the South Asian nation. This venture also received the necessary approval to launch its commercial satellite broadband services.
Jio and Airtel demand spectrum auctions instead of administrative allocation as the operators stated the latter could give more space to newer players and would be less favorable for the existing contenders. However, the Indian government has continued to prefer administrative allocation for satellite spectrum.
The country’s telecom law passed by the Indian government last year allows administrative allocation as an exception for satellite communication spectrum. Last month, the Indian regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, also floated a consultation paper (PDF) exploring the methodology and price for assigning spectrum to satellite companies.
“Satellite spectrum across the world is allocated administratively. So, India is not doing anything different from the rest of the world. Conversely, if you do decide to auction it, then you will be doing something which is different from the rest of the world,” Scindia said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/new-ipad-mini-brings-support-for-apple-intelligence-and-pencil-pro/,New iPad mini brings support for Apple Intelligence and Pencil | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-15,"Apple Tuesday unveiled a new version of the iPad mini updated for the era of Apple Intelligence. The arrival is powered by the A17 Pro chip, bringing compatibility with Apple Intelligence, the company’s new generative AI offering.
The new arrival marks the first major update to the 8.3-inch device since 2021. The A17 Pro, meanwhile, was announced last year, arriving on the iPhone 15 Pro. That premium device, in turn, became the first of Apple’s phones to officially support Apple Intelligence. That changed with a September event, which brought the feature to the newly announced iPhone 16 line.
The A17 Pro sports a six-core CPU with two performance and four efficiency cores and a five-core GPU. Both should deliver significant performance improvements over the A16 Bionic that shipped with the 2021 model. The big news on that front is the neural engine, which delivers access to Apple Intelligence through iPadOS 18.
Highlights on Apple’s small-model answer to the likes of ChatGPT and Google Gemini include writing tools and a fully refreshed Siri experience. Apple Intelligence is still a work in progress, however. Other features, like Image Playground graphic generation and ChatGPT integration with Apple Intelligence, are still on the way.
The addition means that Apple Intelligence is now available across the iPad line — save for the base model. It is, however, the only of the four devices to sport a mobile chip, as opposed to the M4 found in the latest base iPad and iPad Pro. The iPad Air, meanwhile, runs on the older M2.
The new iPad is also getting the revamped Calculator app, which responds to handwritten notes. On that front, the mini is compatible with Apple’s Pencil and Pencil Pro, bringing more flexibility for artists and those who simply prefer to write notes.
The rear-facing 12-megapixel wide-angle camera supports Smart HDR 4 for better-balanced lighting in photos. The mini maintains the Touch ID functionality built into the power button, rather than graduating to Face ID, which is available on the Pro model.
The new iPad starts at $499 for 128GB of storage, which is double what its predecessor started with. The iPad mini with cellular connectivity, meanwhile, starts at $649. The tablet is up for preorder today and starts shipping on October 23."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/amplitude-buys-command-ai-to-bolster-its-app-engagement-offerings/,Amplitude buys Command AI to bolster its app engagement offerings | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-15,"Amplitude, a publicly traded company that makes digital analytics software, has acquired Command AI, an app user engagement startup formerly known as CommandBar.
Most of Command AI’s 30-person, San Francisco-based team will be joining Amplitude. Command AI’s co-founder and CEO James Evans wouldn’t reveal the terms of the deal, but said candidly that an acquisition wasn’t something he’d been planning on.
“Our growth was great and we had plenty of runway,” Evans told TechCrunch. “We weren’t out shopping ourselves or anything. But when Amplitude reached out a little while ago — this summer — we got really excited about the combination and became convinced that we could grow faster and reach more users together.”
A source tells TechCrunch that the deal was worth “north of $45 million.”
Evans started Command AI in 2021 as a way for developers to easily integrate search functionality into their web apps. Together with co-founders Richard Freling and Vinay Ayyala, he built Command AI’s first product: an in-app search bar that provided personalized results, shortcuts, and the ability to highlight new app enhancements.
Over the years, Command AI’s product portfolio expanded to include a chatbot and AI Co-Browsing, which walks a user through in-app features by effectively taking control of their mouse. A more recent tool in development, Nudge Autopilot, shows “nudges” (e.g. reminders to try out certain app features) to users automatically based on metrics.
Twenty-five million end-users interact with Command AI’s products on a regular basis through apps built by clients like HashiCorp, Gusto, Yotpo, and LaunchDarkly, Evans said. Before the Amplitude buyout, Command AI managed to raise $23.8 million from backers including Insight Partners, Itai Tsiddon, and Thrive Capital.
So how does Command AI’s technology fit into Amplitude’s product roadmap? Amplitude CEO and co-founder Spenser Skates says the startup will enable Amplitude to offer “personalized user assistance” via in-product tours, onboarding experiences, and more.
Specifically, early next year, Command AI will launch checklists and guides for Amplitude, which will let customers create app and website action plans as well as interactive product tours. Announcements, another Command AI-powered capability heading to Amplitude, will allow customers to set up “smart triggers” in apps for things like updates and special offers.
Evans sees the integrations as a natural evolution for Command AI, which has offered connectors to Amplitude for some time.
“There’s a really tight loop between tools that help you understand user behavior — Amplitude — and tools that help you influence user behavior — us,” he said. “Imagine you identify a user segment that seems to not be digging your product. Well, naturally, you then might want to ask those users a question with a survey, or try to steer them to some feature they might care about, and then aggregate that feedback or see the impact of that change. We’ve always solved that connection with integration, but being on the same team is going to allow us to build a much tighter feedback loop.”
Evans will become director of product at Amplitude once the deal closes, while Ayyala will become engineering director. They’ll both oversee Amplitude’s new Command AI product org, which will continue to serve current Command AI customers through the end of the year.
Command AI is Amplitude’s third acquisition since its founding a decade ago. In 2020, Amplitude bought ClearBrain, a predictive analytics company, and in 2021, it purchased data pipeline firm Iteratively.
Amplitude claims to have more than 2,700 paying customers, including 26 of the Fortune 100.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/career-karma-founders-launch-outrival-to-help-companies-build-ai-agents/,Career Karma founders launch OutRival to help companies build AI agents | TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,2024-10-15,"Ruben Harris and Timur Meyster, the founders of the upskilling platform Career Karma, announced today the launch of the company OutRival, which offers a service that hosts and lets businesses build their own customer service agents to take on customer interactions.
AI agent companies are hot right now, and AI is one of the only sectors in venture capital seeing a flood of money rush toward it. As of September, the VC industry poured at least $64.1 billion into the AI sector and a third of all VC dollars this year went to AI startups, according to PitchBook data reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Startups building AI agents have alone raised more than $8 billion this year, according to PitchBook data reported by the Verge.
Although OutRival is entering a crowded field, Harris feels now is the perfect time to take aim at the industry. Harris said he and Meyster saw firsthand how important personalized interactions are, as well as the limitations of existing systems like automated phone calls.
“Today with AI, not only are companies in every industry making technology a part of their core operations but AI is fundamentally changing how they do business and how people work,” Harris told TechCrunch. “We knew there had to be a way to scale personalized experiences using AI while making the technology accessible to people closest to the customer journey.”
His company aims to differentiate itself from its competitors by helping — rather than replacing — existing consumer teams, encouraging them to easily build AI agents that can work with existing tools and systems to help converse with customers. The company has operated in beta mode for the past two years and says it’s already working with admissions teams at colleges to help ease workflow. It plans to expand to other industries.
Harris says Career Karma will continue as a separate company, just now owned by OutRival. (It’s even releasing a Netflix documentary on October 16 in partnership with Workday and LeBron James’ SpringHill Company about hiring overlooked talent). Harris told TechCrunch that they took everything they’ve learned from building Career Karma and applied it to the launch of OutRival.
“Career Karma taught us the power of personalized, human-centric interactions and how important it is to scale those experiences without losing the human touch,” he said. “OutRival takes what we’ve built for Career Karma and scales it, making it accessible for enterprises across industries.”
Harris says that Career Karma will now use OutRival’s technology to enhance its own operations, creating AI-driven support to help with its job training platform.
Investors are clearly down for the ride. OutRival is leveraging leftover capital from the $40 million Series B round Career Karma raised in 2022 and says his investors, which include Jack Altman and Initialized Capital, are excited to see what he and Meyster do next.
“We’re excited to partner with more companies and show how OutRival can be a game-changer in delivering exceptional customer experiences,” Harris said.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/google-supercharges-shopping-tab-with-ai-and-personalized-recommendation-feed/,Google supercharges Shopping tab with AI and personalized recommendation feed | TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,2024-10-15,"After bringing generative AI to Search in 2023, Google is supercharging its Shopping tab with the technology. The company announced on Tuesday that it will use AI to help users shop for products based on exactly what they’re looking for. It also launched a new scrollable feed of personalized, shoppable products.
Now, when you search for a product on Google, the results page will include an AI brief with things to consider when shopping. For instance, if you search for a “men’s winter jacket for Seattle,” you will see a summary with things Google thinks you should know before purchasing a new jacket for that specific climate.
An example shared by Google reads: “When choosing a winter jacket for Seattle, prioritize good water resistance or waterproofing to stay dry in the frequent rain. While temperatures rarely dip below freezing, consider a jacket with insulation like down for milder weather or synthetic materials for wetter conditions.”
The AI brief is similar to AI Overviews on Search, which display a snapshot of information at the top of the results page. AI Overviews had a rocky launch after the feature provided incorrect and sometimes dangerous information to users (the feature told users to put glue on pizza, for instance).
With the new Shopping AI briefs, Google acknowledges that the experimental feature may not always get it right.
Beyond the AI briefs, Google is using AI to show you relevant products to speed up your search. Each product that it recommends will include a brief description of why it might be a good match for you. For instance, Google may note that a parka “is made with a recycled nylon shell that can keep you warm in subzero temperatures.”
You will also see categories that give you an overview of the different types of jackets to consider, such as a list of “Synthetic insulated winter jackets for Seattle” or “3-in-1 winter jackets for Seattle.”
If you want to get more specific, you can use filters to see more tailored results, such as searching for something in a certain size or jackets that are available in stock near you.
Google, meanwhile, is using the new personalized shopping feed to surface products and videos based on your preferences. For instance, the feed might recommend Chelsea boots and show you popular pairs from different brands and a series of YouTube Shorts discussing different things to consider when shopping and choosing a pair of boots. After the Chelsea boots, you might scroll to see recommendations for hiking jackets, kitchen appliances, weekend bags, etc.
The scrollable design takes a page out of TikTok’s book, as it’s designed to keep surfacing content that Google thinks you are interested in. Given that TikTok has been accelerating its TikTok Shop business and is already eating into Google’s Search dominance, it makes sense for the tech giant to supercharge its Shopping tab, especially now that TikTok lets advertisers target its search results page.
Google says it paired the 45 billion product listings in Google’s Shopping Graph with Gemini models to transform the Shopping tab. The new features are rolling out in the U.S. over the coming weeks.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/adobes-project-super-sonic-uses-ai-to-generate-sound-effects-for-your-videos/,Adobe's Project Super Sonic uses AI to generate sound effects for your videos | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-10-15,"Creating engaging videos isn’t only about the visuals. So much of the appeal of good video content is about the audio, but finding (or maybe even creating) the right audio effects can be a time-consuming process. At its annual MAX conference, Adobe is showing off Project Super Sonic, an experimental prototype demo that shows how you could one day use text-to-audio, object recognition, and even your own voice to quickly generate background audio and audio effects for your video projects.
Being able to generate audio effects from a text prompt is fun, but given that ElevenLabs and others already offer this commercially, it may not be quite as groundbreaking.
What’s more interesting here is that Adobe is taking all of this a step further by adding two additional modes to create these soundtracks. The first is by using its object recognition models to let you click on any part of a video frame, create a prompt for you and then generate that sound. That’s a smart way to combine multiple models into a single workflow.
The actual wow moment, however, comes with the third mode, which lets you record yourself imitating the sounds you are looking for (timed to the video), and then having Project Super Sonic generate the appropriate audio automatically.
Justin Salamon, the head of Sound Design AI at Adobe, told me that the team started with the text-to-audio model — and he noted that like all Adobe generative AI projects, the team only used licensed data.
“What we really wanted is to give our users control over the process. We want this to be a tool for creators, for sound designers, for everyone who wants to elevate their video with sound. And so we wanted to go beyond the initial workflow of text to sound and that’s why we worked on like the vocal control that really gives you that precise control over energy and timing, that really turns it into an expressive tool,” Salamon explained.
For the vocal control, the tool actually analyzes the different characteristics of the voice and the spectrum of the sound you are making and uses that to guide the generation process. Salamon noted that while the demo uses voice, users could also clap their hands or play an instrument, too.
It’s worth noting that Adobe MAX always features a number of what it calls “sneaks.” These, like Project Super Sonic, are meant to be showcases of some of the experimental features the company is working on right now. While many of these projects do find their way into Adobe’s Creative Suite, there’s no guarantee that they will. And while Project Super Sonic would surely be a useful addition to something like Adobe Premiere, there’s also a chance that we will never see it again.
One reason I believe this project will make it into production is that the same group also worked on the audio portion of Generative Extend, a feature of its Firefly generative AI model that extends short video clips by a few seconds — including their audio track. As of now, though, Project Super Sonic remains a demo.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/how-customer-service-ai-startup-neuron7-convinced-keith-block-to-invest/,How customer service AI startup Neuron7 convinced Keith Block to invest | TechCrunch,Julie Bort,2024-10-15,"Five-year-old AI customer service startup Neuron7 just closed an oversubscribed $44 million Series B round led by Keith Block and his year-and-half-old venture firm, Smith Point Capital.
Neuron7 sits in one of the most promising areas for AI technology: customer service. But unlike the hoards of ChatGPT customer chatbot startups, or those doing natural language searches of manuals, Neuron7 is aimed at complex service and repair operations. Its customers, for instance, include ATM field repair company NCR Atleos, medical device maker Medtronic, and printer/imaging company Lexmark, the company says.
“If you are one of the largest med device companies or high-tech companies, and you give us millions of work order cases, you give us 15,000 manuals, in four days, we will give you a smart resolution hub that says the last 100 times you saw this particular error, these were the seven steps taken,” describes Neuron7 CEO Niken Patel (on the left in the photo above).
Using open source language models like Llama and Mistral, Neuron7 consumes a company’s product repair manuals, all of its support tickets, and other support records. It then predicts the likely cause of a problem, helps the technician bring the correct repair parts and walks the tech through a step-by-step repair process.
Still, customer service AI is an area where there is a lot of competition. There are knowledge database AI startups like Zingtree and Talla. There are call center software companies like Talkdesk that have added knowledge AI to their offerings. And then there’s the giant incumbents, notably (and specifically) Salesforce, but also SAP, Microsoft, and ServiceNow, all of whom are targeting customer service with their AI products.
Neuron7 has addressed the incumbents by partnering with all of the above-mentioned players. And ServiceNow’s corporate VC arm is also an investor.
While Patel wouldn’t comment on Neuron7’s valuation after raising this round, a spokesperson did tell TC that the valuation increased by 5x over its last round. It raised a $10 million Series A in 2022. Neuron7 has now raised just over $63 million to date. PitchbBook estimated the last valuation to be $55 million post money, which, if accurate, would put its current valuation at around the $275 million mark. (The company declined to comment on the accuracy of PitchBook’s valuation.) Battery Ventures and Nexus Venture Partners co-lead the Series A and also participated in this round.
With this raise, the startup landed Block not just as a lead investor but also a board member, Block told TechCrunch. This isn’t just a feather in the cap for Patel and his co-founder Vinay Saini (pictured above, right). Block is best known for his time at Salesforce, rising to co-CEO with Marc Benioff, and his years running sales at Oracle before that. He departed Salesforce in early 2020 (as most of Benioff’s second-in-command heir apparents seem to leave), and resurfaced in April 2023 as a founder of a new $400 million VC fund, along with co-founders Burke Norton and Chris Lytle.
Unlike a typical emerging fund, Smith Point isn’t doing early-stage deals, only early-growth rounds. It targets startups in enterprise applications, data, edge technologies, and, naturally, AI. Given that Block has connections with just about every large enterprise CIO on the planet from his previous roles, founders need a warm intro to get in front of him. (Smith Point’s website is not much more than a landing page.)
“We’re very selective,” Block told TechCrunch. “We work with 10 to 12 companies, and it’s Series B and C growth equity.”
So when Neuron7 got ready to raise its next round, Patel asked his existing investors to introduce him to VCs that were most connected with potential customers. The list was short: 10 names. When Patel saw Block’s name he got excited. He drafted a pitch deck, made the calls and the two met in person.
Block was impressed by Neuron7’s growth: currently 65 full-time employees, 300% growth in ARR last year, which implies a small base revenue number but Patel points out that nearly all of the customers are from Fortune 1000 companies that have deployed the product globally, to up to 6,000-7,000 users each. It counts over 50,000 people as users. Patel said that customers are tending to double the amount they spend on Neuron7’s products 16 to 18 months after they first start using them.
In a world where so much enterprise AI revenue is going toward pilot programs, Block sees an “AI landscape” that’s become “the wild wild west,” he said. “Every board is asking their CEO, what’s the AI strategy?” Neuron7 offers a “compelling” answer, and some “very refreshing” traction data, he said.
“We think it’s a massive opportunity,” Block said. “Service is always ripe for reinvention.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/inversion-space-gets-reentry-license-for-demonstrator-cargo-delivery-capsule/,Inversion Space gets reentry license for orbital cargo delivery capsule demo | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-15,"Inversion Space has become the third company to receive a spacecraft reentry license from the Federal Aviation Administration, paving the way for the startup to launch and return its tech pathfinder mission for orbital delivery later this year.
The three-year-old startup has ambitions of transforming space into a new “transportation layer for Earth” using ultra-fast, on-demand cargo deliveries to anywhere on Earth from orbit. The Ray vehicle is the first hardware Inversion will be sending to space. Mounted on an oven-sized bus, the actual Ray capsule is only about twice the size of a Frisbee — much smaller than the company’s full-scale spacecraft. But the mission will still put much of the final tech to the test.
According to a draft environmental assessment (EA) of Inversion’s plans released by the FAA in May, the aluminum Ray capsule “contains and is intended to test and demonstrate many of Inversion’s custom developed systems that allow for a decreased cost and increased cadence of reentry space capsules.”
The FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation issued the vehicle operator license for Inversion’s Ray under new Part 450 regulations designed to modernize spacecraft licensing. It joins SpaceX and Varda on the short list of operators with approval to reenter spacecraft, though only Varda was also approved under Part 450 regs. The new regulatory framework was finalized in 2020 to streamline the licensing process for satellite and rocket operators, though there have been a fair number of critics that question whether Part 450 has achieved that goal. The licensing process for Inversion’s Ray took 18 months, a spokesperson said.
The new license gives Inversion a green light to return the Ray capsule back to Earth for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. Ray, which will launch on SpaceX’s Transport-12 rideshare mission (likely sometime this month), will spend between one to five weeks in space, Inversion CEO Justin Fiaschetti said in a previous interview with TechCrunch.
The reentry would occur in two stages, the EA says: First, the capsule would deploy a drogue parachute when Ray is traveling at around Mach 2 and help the capsule decelerate from supersonic speed. When the capsule is around 6,000 feet above sea level, the main parachute will deploy, and the capsule will slow to 15.5 miles per hour to splash down.
The craft will then activate a recovery buoy that will broadcast the capsule’s location to Inversion’s mission control center, and a team will go recover the 41-pound capsule from the water.
Following the Ray demonstration missions, Inversion plans to introduce a larger vehicle named Arc and launch that as early as 2026, though this will require a separate license."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/early-automates-code-testing-for-developers/,Early automates code testing for developers | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-10-15,"Early is a Tel Aviv-based startup that uses generative AI to generate unit tests, helping programmers catch potential bugs early in the development cycle. The company, which launched in August, today announced that it has raised a $5 million seed funding round led by Zeev Ventures, with participation from Dynamic Loop Capital.
In its current form, Early supports JavaScript and TypeScript and integrates with the Visual Studio Code IDE. From there, developers can quickly see how much of their code is covered by tests and then automatically generate validated tests right from within the IDE. Those tests, the company says, include mocks and aim to cover a wide variety of scenarios like happy paths and edge cases, which developers would otherwise have to code by hand.
While its focus right now is on helping developers create unit tests, Early CEO and co-founder Sharon Barr (pictured above, right) tells me that the overall mission is significantly broader. In an interview ahead of today’s announcement, Barr stressed that he doesn’t think of Early as a testing company. “I like to call us a code quality company,” he said.
Code quality is something Barr surely knows about. Before founding Early, he was the VP of Engineering for Couchbase from 2010 to 2013 and then became the CTO of biotech company Bina. Bina was later acquired by Roche, where Barr held the role of VP of Software Engineering until 2018. He then joined EY Global, where he held a number of executive roles, reporting directly to the CTO.
His co-founder and CTO, Lior Froimovich (pictured above, left), was an engineering lead at EY Global — a role Barr hired him for — and before that, he co-founded two startups.
“A year ago, I left EY together with my co-founder, Lior, whom I hired six years ago, and we said, ‘Okay, let’s see what we can do with this new, exciting technology of GenAI — and one of the problems that we faced ourselves on our career is code quality,” Barr told me. “And then we said, ‘Okay, let’s start with testing.’ Let’s see if you can generate code for testing — and in the world of testing, let’s start with unit tests. We experimented with it. We ended up raising money very quickly from Zeev Ventures, much faster than we expected, and have focused on the product since then.”
Barr, like most of the AI startup founders I talk to these days, does not believe that AI and AI agents will replace humans anytime soon. But he does believe that a service like Early can free developers to focus on the more creative parts of coding.
“The Early team’s deep understanding of both AI’s potential and the nuances of software development puts them at the forefront of this revolution,” said Oren Zeev, founder of Zeev Ventures. “They’re not just using AI; they’re applying it strategically to solve one of the most persistent and costly challenges in coding. I believe Early will become an indispensable tool for developers, dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with bug detection and fixing, and ultimately accelerating innovation across the tech industry.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/youtube-adds-new-features-for-playback-speed-and-playlists/,"YouTube gets better playback speed controls, collaborative playlists in new update | TechCrunch",Ivan Mehta,2024-10-15,"YouTube on Tuesday added new features to its mobile, web, and TV apps, including granular controls for playback speeds, a redesigned mini-player, collaborative playlists and badges.
Until now, users had controls to increase the playback speed in increments of 0.25x. With the latest release, YouTube will let users increase or decrease the playback speed by 0.05x by tapping on the “+” or “-” symbols on the new playback speed control menu.
The company has also made it easier to make collaborative playlists. You can now share a link or a QR code for a playlist with someone, and users can add their own photos as a thumbnail or use YouTube’s GenAI tool to add one using a prompt.
Later in the year, the company will add the ability for collaborators to vote on videos. Creators would also be able to use this feature to get feedback on videos through a playlist.
YouTube is making some design changes to the mobile app as well. On Android, when the app is used in landscape mode, or horizontally, videos now have larger thumbnails and bigger text, and the player is more responsive to inputs as well. These features will come to the iOS app later this year.
YouTube is also improving the mini-player experience, letting users move and adjust the size of the player while browsing YouTube.
The TV app gets more immersive video previews as well as a better UI for watching YouTube Shorts on the big screen.
In August, YouTube started testing a sleep timer for its paid users, and the company is now extending this feature to all users. You can set a timer, after which playback will pause automatically.
YouTube is also adding badges on the YouTube and YouTube Music app to give content creators a new way to engage with their community: The first set has two badges called “first batch of paid members” and “correctly completed a quiz.” This update comes to the Communities space that YouTube launched in September to let users interact with creators."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/monogoto-an-innovator-in-connectivity-as-a-service-raises-27m/,"Monogoto, an innovator in ‘connectivity as a service,’ raises $27M | TechCrunch",Ingrid Lunden,2024-10-15,"Connectivity and connected networks are part and parcel of the way many devices and services operate today, thanks to innovations and expansions in mobile networks, on-device processing, and the cloud. But behind the scenes, there remains a lot of fragmentation: Different regions, technologies, tariffs, and devices can spell a lot of work for enterprises or service providers that want to leverage that connectivity in a cohesive manner.
A startup called Monogoto has built a platform based on software-defined connectivity to help manage that work, and now it is announcing $27 million in funding.
Underscoring the demand for its “connectivity-as-a-service” technology, this Series A round is heavy with strategic backers. Toyota Ventures (the venture arm of the huge carmaker) is leading the round, which also saw participation from new investors Samsung Next, Kickstart, Assembly Ventures, Magenta, and J-Ventures, as well as previous backers The Singtel Group, Telefónica, Team8, Alter Venture Partners, and Triventures.
Monogoto has raised a total of $38 million to date. It is not disclosing its valuation.
A number of startups have identified gaps in the market for improving how connected devices actually connect to networks, and it’s a ripe market. The fact is that we have multiple carriers around the world, and each have their own tariffs and different wireless technologies. This means when an enterprise is running a fleet of cars or drones, or a services business wants to operate across multiple geographies or networks, they have to figure out how to stitch together patchworks of coverage. (Some startups in this general area include Cubic Telecom, FloLive, Airalo, and Wirepas.)
Notably, Palo Alto-based Monogoto tackles that challenge with software that it has scaled to span 180 countries and 550 networks, including public cellular networks, private LTE or 5G networks, and satellite networks.
Itamar Kunik, the CEO who co-founded the company with Maor Efrati (CTO), worked for nine years on telecoms infrastructure projects for the Israeli military’s 8200 intelligence unit. It was there that he saw how tricky it was to get services to work consistently across networks, despite the solutions available in the market to orchestrate connections. After leaving Unit 8200, he worked at Fring, a mobile messaging app that was also trying to figure out how to work more efficiently on legacy mobile networks, and that was when he had his “a-ha” moment.
“Twilio was rising, and we were banging our heads,” he recalled. And then he had a realization: Twilio was not a telephony company; it was an API platform for developers. “’This is what we should do,’ we said, but for the next wave of need. That next wave is connectivity.”
Thus Monogoto was born.
The company today works with businesses across asset tracking, smart metering, fleet management, and telematics for vehicles, point-of-sale device providers, retail, healthcare, and micromobility. It covers not only the devices that work with network management services based on hardware like SIMs, it also works with software.
Monogoto’s end users are typical customers, carriers who want to both operate their own connected services and provision connectivity solutions on behalf of enterprises. The use cases typically involve devices like phones, vehicles, and drones, but sometimes they are a little more organic: One customer is using Monogoto’s network to help track and manage thousands of cattle — they have little trackers on their ears — roaming across plains covered by a mix of network technologies.
“Enterprises have long sought an infrastructure that can truly facilitate connectivity in the new age, and Monogoto is leading this shift with its software-defined, accessible, and affordable solution,” said Chris Thomas, co-founder and partner at Assembly Ventures, in a statement."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/cato-networks-adds-a-digital-experience-monitoring-service-to-its-platform/,Cato Networks adds a Digital Experience Monitoring service to its SASE platform | TechCrunch,Frederic Lardinois,2024-10-15,"Since it was founded in 2015, Cato Networks has evangelized the concept of a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) platform that combines many of the features of software-defined networking, modern network security tools, and endpoint protection into a single service backed by a global private network. The promise here is that instead of managing dozens of different networking and security tools, a cloud-native SASE provider like Cato can now offer IT all these tools under a single umbrella, allowing those teams to be more agile.
Now, the company is expanding its platform with the addition of a Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) service.
DEM is not a new concept, of course. At its core, it combines application performance management (APM), which measures how applications and the services they rely on perform from a technical point of view, and data from real users and devices to provide insights into how users perceive the performance of a given service. That means when an IT team gets complaints from an enterprise employee about the performance of a line-of-business application, for example, a DEM solution allows them to pinpoint if the issue is their Wi-Fi network or internet connection, a specific service, or the application itself.
Founded by Check Point co-founder Shlomo Kramer and Incapsula co-founder Gur Shatz, Cato was last valued at over $3 billion. As Kramer told me in an interview ahead of today’s announcement, the idea of adding a DEM service came naturally to Cato, given that it was always meant to be a platform play.
“The idea here is to reduce — or stop — the bleeding of the IT security budget as part of IT security […] and provide better security to the entire pyramid of enterprises — and not only for the tip of the pyramid, which is the traditional point products approach and portfolio companies that consolidate the successful point product startups,” Kramer told me. “At the tip of that is Palo Alto [Networks], the portfolio company, but delivering that to the entire pyramid that can’t afford all these point products and [Enterprise License Agreements] and integrations. The answer is, as we all know now, a platform. That’s Wiz in the cloud, and CrowdStrike on the endpoint, and Cato on the network side.”
Kramer, who was an early investor in Palo Alto Networks, doesn’t shy away from comparing his own portfolio company with Cato, describing Palo Alto as a “great second-generation company,” and Cato as one of the two main players in this field. He does acknowledge that while the concept of SASE is becoming mainstream, it isn’t quite there yet, “because many people think that SASE is going to continue to live side by side with the appliances and the cloud proxies,” as he described it.
Since it’s so core to a company’s network, it’s maybe no surprise that Cato is now expanding to DEM as well. Indeed, Kramer said that this feature — though he may have still called it application performance management back then, was on the company’s earliest roadmap.
“[Cato DEM] has the broadest dataset, the broadest context, because we have the entire end-to-end picture available to us in real time. You would need to build a very complicated point product in order to do that — and we got it in 1/10th of the time of anybody else because the platform provided it for us,” Kramer explained.
With Cato DEM, the company says, it will get easier and faster for IT teams to exactly pinpoint where network problems affect the user experience. This includes visibility from the Wi-Fi network to the network edge. Cato continuously monitors the network and alerts the affected teams when there are issues.
Since it uses the same AI engines under the hood as some of Cato’s other products, users can also query the database in natural language, but maybe more importantly, when there is an issue, it can automatically generate “stories” for these teams that lay out in detail where (and maybe why) the issue occurred.
“If you can make a decision based on data from the client to the network to the application, all available in real time, you’re making a better decision and you are alerting only if you need to,” Kramer said. “If you are now collecting all this data in a data lake, and hunting for patterns over time that look suspicious, and we tell you a story, then that story is valuable.”
Cato’s new DEM service is now available as a paid add-on to all of its 2,500+ customers."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/xscape-is-building-multicolor-lasers-for-datacenters/,Xscape is building multicolor lasers to connect chips within data centers | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-15,"The GPUs and other chips used to train AI communicate with each other inside data centers through “interconnects.” But those interconnects have limited bandwidth, which limits AI training performance. A 2022 survey found that AI developers typically struggle to use more than 25% of a GPU’s capacity.
One solution could be new interconnects with much higher bandwidth, according to Vivek Raghunathan, the CEO and co-founder of startup Xscape Photonics. The secret sauce, he says, is silicon photonics: silicon-based material that manipulates light to transmit data.
“Xscape has created a platform that connects various computing elements in a sustainable way, while offering the highest possible performance,” Raghunathan told TechCrunch in an interview. “The core of this platform’s scaling relies on energy-efficient, cost-effective systems that do not exist in the industry yet.”
Xscape is based in Santa Clara in the heart of Silicon Valley, but has its roots in a Columbia University lab, where three professors — Alexander Gaeta, Keren Bergman, and Michal Lipson — invented a technique they believed could be used to transmit terabytes of data over light.
The trio spun off Xscape in 2022 after recruiting Raghunathan and Yoshitomo Okawachi, a laser engineer and a longtime colleague of Gaeta’s. Raghunathan joined by way of Broadcom, where he helped found the silicon photonics team, and Intel, where he was manager for the company’s silicon photonics products.
Traditional interconnects consist of metal wires that transmit data in the form of electrical signals.
Metal-based interconnects require a lot of power — and generate lots of heat. They’re bandwidth-constrained by their medium’s conductivity. And, in data centers with fiber-optic links between components, the interconnects’ electrical data must be converted into optical and back again, introducing latency.
Silicon photonics like Xscape’s, in contrast, draw minimal power and produce negligible heat.
“In the past, we primarily used optical communications for long-haul fiber-optic systems,” Raghunathan said. “But recent advancements are enabling the integration of optics-on-chip — in the form of silicon photonics — and bringing the optical interface from the electronic plane to the optical plane all the way into the chip.”
Xscape’s first product is a programmable laser to power data center fiber-optic interconnects, specifically the links among GPUs, AI chips, and memory hardware. The laser can leverage different colors of light (i.e. wavelengths) to transmit multiple data streams along the same link without interference, Raghunathan claims.
“Electrical systems densely packed together tend to produce crosstalk, interference, and other challenges,” he said. “However, within the optical domain, data can be modulated on different colors, wavelengths, or channels, and all co-propagate within the same wire or fiber — and not interfere with each other.”
Assuming the tech works as advertised, Xscape faces the same challenge as most hardware startups: manufacturing and selling its products at scale. In a possible leg up over photonics rivals like Ayar Labs and Celestial AI, Xscape’s lasers can be fabricated using the same facilities used to make the microelectronics in phones and laptops.
The first-generation laser can only emit between four and 16 colors. However, Xscape is already planning improved versions that’ll be able to emit up to 128.
Xscape says that it’s “actively engaged” with 10 customers for potential deployments, ranging from vendors to hyperscalers — and that it has secured funding from Cisco and Nvidia, whose venture arms invested in its recent $44 million Series A round. The investments aren’t strategic, meaning that the companies aren’t currently customers. But Raghunathan notes that Cisco is one of the largest sellers of optical networking components in the world.
“This reflects Cisco and Nvidia’s trust in the value we bring to this ecosystem,” Raghunathan said.
The latest funding round was led by IAG Capital Partners, and brought the company’s total raised to $57 million. Raghunathan says that the proceeds will be put toward growing Xscape’s 24-person team, and scaling up fabrication of its lasers and related photonics tech.
“The funding will allow Xscape to push the boundaries of our platform and integrate it with simulation, high-performance compute, and AI software to help customers in all industries take their innovations to new heights,” Raghunathan said.
Xscape certainly has its work cut out for it. Aside from Ayar and Celestial, the firm competes with Intel in the multibillion-dollar silicon photonics market. Intel claims to have shipped more than 8 billion photonics chips and 3.2 million on-chip lasers since 2016."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/port-is-building-internal-tool-hubs-for-devs/,Port hosts internal tool hubs for devs | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-15,"Port, a platform designed to centralize multiple dev tools and workflows in a single dashboard, has raised $35 million in a Series B led by Accel with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners.
Yonatan Boguslavski and Zohar Einy, now Port’s CEO, founded the company in 2022 after serving together in the Israel Defense Forces. Prior to Port, Einy was a solutions manager at debugging tool startup Rookout, and helped to launch an AI monitoring firm called Aporia.
Einy has long been of the opinion that devs are overly dependent on DevOps teams — the teams that oversee app planning, testing, and development — for tasks like resolving incidents and creating services. This creates a bottleneck that hurts scalability, he says.
“Modern developers are responsible for much more than just writing code,” Einy told TechCrunch. “They manage everything from deploying features and cloud resources to handling bugs, outages, and following security and compliance standards. These expanded roles, combined with the increasing layers in today’s development environment, have created inefficiencies across teams.”
With Port, Einy and Boguslavski sought to deliver a more self-service way for devs to request any resources they need to do their work. Port aggregates ongoing dev projects while providing visibility into the health and progress of those projects.
Port is what’s known as an internal developer portal, or IDP: a hub with dev resources, tools, and documentation to build apps. There isn’t much public data on IDP adoption besides Port’s, which obviously has to be taken with a grain of salt. But per the firm’s recent polling, 44% of companies already have or plan to add an IDP this year.
What’s driving adoption? DevOps is a tough function, these days — and it isn’t getting any easier. One survey found that close to half of DevOps teams feel pressured to deploy apps before they’re thoroughly tested, and face unrealistic expectations around app development.
Port competes with startups like Cortex in the IDP market, as well as — oddly enough — Spotify. (Spotify has a robust enterprise and dev tooling business, wouldn’t you know.) In one effort to stand out from the competition, Port recently introduced tracking of dev-relevant metrics like “time to restore service” and “deployment frequency.” Port also built AI into its platform for certain basic functionality, like natural language search and developer tool suggestions.
“Port is an open platform, so each organization can leverage AI models according to their needs,” Einy said of the AI piece. “Some of the popular uses we’ve seen so far are using search when investigating incidents, automatically generating a clear error message from the logs of a failed build, and recommending internal libraries and components to developers based on the feature or service they’re currently working on.”
Port, which has raised $58 million in capital to date, plans to add 30 staffers to its 100-person workforce by the end of the year. Einy says that Port has 10,000 users across customers like LG, British Telecom, and GitHub, and is on track to grow revenue 7x compared to last year.
“We’ll use the funds from the Series B to scale our operations and enhance our service offerings,” he added. “A significant portion of this funding will go toward enhancing our product range to not only serve developers, but also extend our reach to security teams, product managers, and leadership.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/simplisafes-new-outdoor-monitoring-service-combines-ai-with-human-agents/,SimpliSafe’s new outdoor monitoring service combines AI with human agents | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-15,"SimpliSafe has announced the addition of Active Guard Outdoor Protection to its monthly subscription offerings. The new tier includes an added layer of 24/7 monitoring to the home security service. Outdoor Protection Pro is available for $50 a month, a price that includes the Boston-based firm’s standard $32 indoor monitoring service.
The new offering will only be available via a new piece of hardware, the Outdoor Security Camera Series 2. SimpliSafe says the limitations are due to its predecessor’s inability to run its ‘AI for the Familiar Face’ feature, which assures that users don’t trigger false alarms at their own homes.
If the system doesn’t recognize the person based on past training, a human agent will be alerted. Depending on the situation, response, and other factors, the SimpliSafe employee can alert the person that they’re being monitored, trigger a siren and flood lights, and alert authorities as necessary.
Product SVP Hooman Shahidi tells TechCrunch that SimpliSafe was intentional in its decision to involve the human agent in the process, so the final decision isn’t being made by AI.
“[The AI] is all to aid the agents,” explains Shahidi. “We’ve trained our agents on racial bias and have a pretty diverse workforce that manages our monitoring center. This is really just to help them, as opposed to being a replacement for them.”
CEO Christian Cerda adds that, while SimpliSafe — like every other company on Earth — is testing generative AI solutions, the company is taking a cautious approach to how these technologies are deployed.
The Outdoor Security Camera Series 2 is priced at $200 — the same as its predecessor. The camera is waterproof and designed to be mounted to a wall or other surface. It can be battery-powered or hardwired for power. The system shoots in HD with a 140-degree view, catching details up to 15 feet away. Microphones and speakers are also built-in for two-way communication.
Founded in 2006, SimpliSafe is one of the top three home security companies in the U.S., along with ADT and Vivint. In those 18 years, the firm has continued to see increased competition as smart home cameras proliferate from the likes of Amazon’s Ring and Google’s Nest.
SimpliSafe does the vast majority of its business in the U.S., adding its first international office in the U.K. in 2019. In April 2023 the security firm’s headquarters moved into a larger Boston office space. The company is also home to a good number of former iRobot employees, including Cerda, who was previously the Roomba-maker’s COO."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/20vc-closes-new-400m-fund-to-make-europe-great-again-says-harry-stebbings/,"20VC closes new $400M fund to 'make Europe great again,' says Harry Stebbings | TechCrunch",Ingrid Lunden,2024-10-15,"Harry Stebbings (pictured above), the U.K. podcaster who broke into the world of tech with his 20-minute interviews of venture capitalists and founders, parlayed that fame into becoming a VC himself. Now, Stebbings has closed his third investment vehicle, and it’s his biggest yet: 20VC, the firm named after the podcast series, has closed a $400 million fund.
At a time when European technology companies continue to lag behind their U.S. counterparts at almost every stage of investment, 20VC’s new fund will focus on backing startups in the region, using Stebbings’ media nous and connections to bring more attention to them.
“I’m really fed up of everyone shitting on Europe,” he said in an interview earlier today. “We have unbelievable companies, and we have incredible people. We need to make Europe great again. MEGA!” he added with a giggle.
About $125 million of the fund will be dedicated to seed investments, and $275 million will go to Series A rounds. The fund is yet to be deployed, Stebbings said, as 20VC is still investing out of its second fund, which raised $140 million in 2021.
Stebbings says the new fund was raised in four weeks, which would be an exceedingly quick turnaround, considering the constraints that continue to swirl around venture capital. (Business Insider reported he was at least in pitching mode back in June.)
There are a few other notable takeaways from the news:
Venture capitalist firms like Accel, as well as successful founders who have become investors, have an established presence in London and the wider region. Yet, a number of such investors are still putting money into 20VC. Why? Stebbings has put a very personal face onto his firm, and he helps investors hedge their bets.
In all, 20VC said 40 founders from companies like Atlassian, Candy Crush, Canva, Capital One, Datadog, Deliveroo, Eventbrite, Iconiq, Procore, Spotify, UiPath, and Vinted invested in the fund. Also investing were general partners from Accel, Benchmark, Coatue, Cyberstarts, Founder Collective, Founders Fund, Khosla, NEA, TCV, and Thrive.
“We are the feet on the ground for the U.S. funds too,” he said.
Stebbings has tapped into the zeitgeist around being an online creator who has built a successful business around his content. In his case, that business is in the area of venture capital, but he leverages his profile to help open doors and get in on term sheets.
“The media platform has really helped,” he said. 20VC was essentially a “micro VC” when it debuted in 2020, with just $8.3 million to invest, typically to piggy back on seed rounds. Now it gets upwards of 50 million views on TikTok and YouTube — large numbers for what is effectively VC and startup inside baseball. “Having your Sam Altmans on the show, your Marc Benioffs, it makes a big difference. Founders do really want to take your money.”
Stebbings himself is not a technologist by training — he was at university studying law when he started 20VC and dropped out when it all took off. He makes no attempts to hide this.
“I don’t follow technology,” he said when I asked him if any categories are standing out right now. “I follow great entrepreneurs. I think it’s absolutely bullshit that we think we’re smarter than markets. If there’s one thing we have to learn, it is that great founders shape markets. And if that’s the case, my job is to simply find the best founders before anyone else.”
Beyond that, his selling point from early on has been that he brings operational experience to his portfolio companies.
“20VC has done over £10 million in revenue and is a very profitable and sustainable business,” he said. “No, I’m not a technology founder, but I am an operator. I work seven days a week, 15 hours a day, and I have done for years.”
Now, that has been widened out, with 20VC operating what Stebbings describes as “sub-funds” in categories like sales, product and growth. These have teams also run by people with operator experience, who have their own carry and seek out companies (and founders) that look interesting and could benefit from their practical advice in these areas.
Despite breaking the mold for how VCs are formed, Stebbings has yet to change the economics of VC. It remains “like any other market,” he said. “One percent of the companies make 90% of the gains.”
That might not be such a bad thing, though. “We can do more to normalize that in Europe, encouraging trying and failing,” he said.
For VCs ironically, that extremely uneven math might spell more opportunity for big wins, not less, in his opinion. “Venture returns on the whole will go down, [but] for 1% of firms, they will be much, much bigger than ever, and better than ever, because the size of the outcomes is so much larger than ever,” he predicted.
That said, Stebbings is still waiting for his “MEGA” payout. A lot of the firms he’s invested in are still relatively young, the IPO market is still pretty dead, and some of the startups in its portfolio still point to the U.S. focus that 20VC had when it started.
The closest, Stebbings said, is probably Tripledot, the London-based gaming studio that appears to be valued at just over $1 billion, per PitchBook, and last raised in 2022."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/gladia-believes-real-time-processing-is-the-next-frontier-of-audio-transcription-apis/,Gladia believes real-time processing is the next frontier of audio transcription APIs | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-10-15,"French startup Gladia, which offers a speech-recognition application programming interface (API), has raised $16 million in a Series A funding round. Essentially, Gladia’s API lets you turn any audio file into text with a high level of accuracy and low turnaround time.
While Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all offer speech-to-text APIs as part of their cloud-hosting product suites, they don’t perform as well as newer models offered by specialized startups.
There has been tremendous progress in this field over the past couple of years, especially after the release of Whisper by OpenAI. Gladia competes with other well-funded companies in the space, such as AssemblyAI, Deepgram and Speechmatics.
Gladia originally offered a fine-tuned version of Whisper’s speech-to-text model with some much needed improvements. For instance, the startup supports diarization out of the box — it can detect when there are multiple speakers in a conversation and separate the recording, and transcribed text, depending on who’s talking.
Gladia supports 100 languages and a wide variety of accents. This reporter can confirm that it works, as we’ve been using Gladia to transcribe some interviews, and accents weren’t an issue.
The startup offers its speech-to-text model as a hosted API that users can leverage in their own applications and services. More than 600 companies use Gladia, including several meeting recorders and note-taking assistants like Attention, Circleback, Method Financial, Recall, Sana and Veed.io.
That particular use case is interesting, because many companies have to chain API calls. They first turn speech into text, which they then feed into a large language model (LLM), such as GPT-4o or ‎Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to extract knowledge from large walls of text.
With the new funding, Gladia wants to simplify that pipeline by integrating audio intelligence and LLM-based tasks in a single API call. For instance, a customer could get a conversation summary generated from a handful of bullet points without having to rely on a third-party LLM API.
The other issue that Gladia is looking to solve is latency. You may have seen some demos of real-time audio conversations with an AI-based calling agent (11x has a good demo on its website), and these systems have to be able to transcribe in near real time to make such conversations sound as human-like as possible.
“We realized that real time wasn’t very good in terms of quality in the market in general. And people had a weird use case. They were doing real-time processing, and then they were grabbing the audio and running it in batch. We wondered: ‘Why are you doing this?’ They told us: ‘The quality isn’t good in real-time processing, so we transcribe it in batch afterwards,’” co-founder and CEO Jean-Louis Quéguiner (pictured above; right) told TechCrunch.
Gladia chose to tackle this problem, and it can currently transcribe a live conversation with a latency of under 300 milliseconds. The company claims that the real-time processing is now more or less as good as the default, asynchronous batch transcription API, but it’s hard for us to judge without some proper testing. As Quéguiner says, the startup is aiming for “batch quality with real-time capabilities.”
AI calling agents aside, you could imagine a call center using those real-time capabilities to help calling agents find relevant information in the middle of a call. “Our single API is compatible with all existing tech stacks and protocols, including SIP, VoIP, FreeSwitch and Asterisk,” co-founder and CTO Jonathan Soto (pictured above; left) said in a statement.
XAnge is leading the Series A funding round. Illuminate Financial, XTX Ventures, Athletico Ventures, Gaingels, Mana Ventures, Motier Ventures, Roosh Ventures, and Soma Capital also participated.
Gladia believes we are on the brink of a “ChatGPT moment” for audio applications. GPT technology has been around for years, but ChatGPT really popularized LLMs with its consumer chat-like interface.
As Apple or Google start including transcription models within iOS or Android, consumers will start to understand the value of automated transcription within the apps they use. Developers will likely then integrate audio features in their products, and that’s where API providers like Gladia will come in."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/spotify-is-adding-music-video-support-in-85-additional-markets/,Spotify is adding music video support in 85 additional markets | TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,2024-10-15,"Music streaming company Spotify said today that it is testing music videos for premium users in 85 additional markets. The company first ran a video experiment in limited markets in March.
Spotify originally rolled out music videos in beta in 11 countries, including the U.K., Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Brazil, Colombia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Kenya. Earlier this year, Egypt was added to the list.
The company didn’t specify if these 85 new markets included the U.S. It’s a large market for the streaming giant but was omitted in the first set of regions where music videos were available. Despite the new expansion, the music video feature remains limited to paid users.
The service’s music videos are available on mobile and desktop. Users can easily switch between audio and video through a toggle. At first, when you switched from audio to video, the video would start playing from the beginning. The company has now made the switch more seamless.
Spotify is also adding video indicators next to track names so you can spot them easily in search results.
Users can turn their phone to landscape mode to switch to the full-screen video. The company said that listeners who discover a song and watch the music video on the app are 34% more likely, on average, to stream the song again the following week.
Part of YouTube’s appeal as a music streaming service has been its native support for music videos. Spotify is now trying to get some music video-loving fans to sway their way."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/concourse-is-building-ai-to-automate-financial-tasks/,Concourse is building AI to automate financial tasks | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-15,"In a typical organization, finance is one of the most important functions. Yet teams are often bogged down by manual workflows. According to a survey by Paylocity, an HR software provider, 38% of finance teams spend more than a fourth of their time on manual jobs, like reviewing invoices.
Matthieu Hafemeister, an ex-fintech investor at Andreessen Horowitz, says he’s seen many finance orgs struggle to scale up as a result of all the work they’re doing by hand.
“​The status quo for finance is countless point solutions that are cobbled together within the finance department,” Hafemeister told TechCrunch. “Excel continues to be the lowest common denominator, limiting the promise of automation.”
To Hafemeister’s point, most finance departments are indeed heavily reliant on spreadsheets. One survey found that 82% still use Excel files for budgeting, forecasting, and other core financial planning activities.
After experiencing these frustrations firsthand while leading growth at fintech firm Jeeves, Hafemeister decided to team up with Ted Michaels, Jeeves’ previous head of finance and an old friend, to launch a platform to automate financial tasks.
Called Concourse, the platform connects to a business’ financial systems to let finance teams retrieve and analyze data, generate charts, and ask ad hoc questions such as “What’s our non-GAAP revenue?”
“Concourse can proactively surface insights that allow finance teams to be better prepared by enabling them to stay ahead of trends,” Hafemeister said. “Instead of a tool that tries to improve the speed or efficiency of completing a task, Concourse can be given discrete tasks to do entirely on its own.”
Now, finance automation isn’t exactly new technology. Linq recently emerged from stealth with AI to automate aspects of research for financial analysts. Ledge and Doopla are also building a range of finance-specific generative modeling tools.
But what makes Concourse different, according to Hafemeister, is its ability to execute financial workflows with “complex, multi-step operations.” For example, the platform can retrieve data from a company’s NetSuite dashboard to download CSV files, then copy that data to an Excel spreadsheet.
“We leverage large language models to do what they are best suited for and pair them with more traditional methods of data analysis,” Hafemeister explained.
There’s great interest in AI for finance. One poll found that 58% of finance teams are now using some form of AI technology, up 21% from 2023. Grand View Research estimates that the “AI in fintech” segment, worth $9.45 billion three years ago, is growing 16.5% annually.
But to stand a chance of making a dent in the market for finance automation tech, Concourse will have to demonstrate its product’s ROI — a challenging feat. Per Gartner, showing or estimating the value of AI is a top barrier to adopting it for close to half of companies.
Concourse will also have to assuage potential customers’ fears of AI-introduced errors and hallucinations. In a poll of U.K.-based executives by HR specialist Peninsula, 40% said inaccuracies from AI tools were a key concern, followed by concerns around data confidentiality.
Hafemeister said that Concourse employs “a variety of tools and techniques” for fact-checking and validation to try to ensure its AI performs tasks as intended. He added that Concourse doesn’t use companies’ data to train its AI models — at least not without explicit permission — and that the platform only collects data customers share with it.
“Data accuracy is paramount in finance, where answers are typically either entirely correct or entirely incorrect,” Hafemeister said. “As such, at Concourse we’ve spent a lot of time and effort on delivering AI that can accurately perform the task it’s been assigned. We also take data privacy and security very seriously, and have built Concourse using industry best practices.”
Folks seem willing to take Hafemeister at his word.
Concourse, which is still in beta ahead of a broader launch planned for next year, has several customers, including Instabase and Shef, and $4.7 million in capital. Hafemeister’s ex-employer, a16z, has invested in the startup, along with Y Combinator, CRV, and BoxGroup.
Hafemeister says the focus at the moment is product development and growing New York-based Concourse’s six-person staff.
“We raised money to hire more engineers, build out more workflows that our AI can take on, increase coverage on data integrations, and start to scale our go-to-market function,” he said. “The strong focus on engineering recruiting is to hire backend, machine learning, and AI engineers.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/oura-ring-4-isnt-an-apple-watch-replacement-but-thats-not-the-point/,"Oura Ring 4 isn’t an Apple Watch replacement, but that's not the point | TechCrunch",Brian Heater,2024-10-15,"Oura didn’t invent the smart ring category. It did, however, make all that came before it effectively obsolete. The category dates back more than a decade; TechCrunch wrote about an NFC ring in 2013.
The Motiv Ring is of far more recent vintage, but it ultimately struggled to find the right use case before being sold off to a digital security company just as the pandemic was cresting on U.S. shores.
As a company, Oura dates back to 2013, launching its first ring two years later via Kickstarter. It was, however, COVID-19 that truly launched the company into public consciousness, via high-profile partnerships with sports leagues. The NBA garnered the most headlines, as it adopted the ring to detect early signs of sickness while teams played in the bubble.
The company found eventual success through a passive fitness tracker model. Rather than seeing the small form factor and lack of display as a detriment to the product’s efficacy, the company leaned into a model wherein such passivity is more feature than bug.
Oura CEO Tom Hale recently told me that nearly two-thirds of its user base owns another wearable. This is an extremely important data point when considering the smart ring’s role in the broader wearable fitness space. Among other things, it points to a product that works well in tandem with devices like Apple Watch, rather than attempting to compete with them outright.
Like other smartwatches, the Apple device beeps, buzzes, and flashes, demanding your attention. Sure, there’s a sense it can liberate the wearer from staring constantly at a phone, but it’s always there, vying for immediate attention. Sometimes that’s a good thing. If you’re actively engaged in a workout, for instance, or if you’re the sort who needs a little haptic motivation to get in your steps each day.
Though nice looking for what it is, Oura’s ring is designed to be forgotten. It’s a straightforward task for a ring — doubly so with the Oura Ring 4. Little has changed to the ring’s exterior; it remains a minimalist metal band. The interior, on the other hand, is more flush, courtesy of recessed sensors. It’s a small change, sure, but it dramatically improves the ring’s comfort level.
I’m among those who never adopted Oura or similar devices because I don’t like the way rings feel (sorry, ladies). The unevenly structured sensors of earlier models only exacerbated that discomfort. After wearing the Oura 4 this past week, I can confirm the new ring is much more comfortable.
That’s likely also thanks to an expanded number of sizes, now ranging from four to 15. Despite my having tested the last couple of rings, Oura insisted I receive another sizing kit, as things have shifted overall. Currently, the ring is comfortable enough that I mostly don’t notice.
Blending into the background is the whole game. This is a big part of why sleep was a cornerstone early on. I could be sleeping better. Most people reading this could probably say the same. But wearing a smartwatch to bed no doubt impedes many folks’ ability to fall or stay asleep. A ring, on the other hand, is entirely manageable.
Even more essential to the sleep issue is the question of battery, which continues to be the Apple Watch’s biggest issue. The company has continued to tweak its software, but as it stands, those who want to wear their device for both activity and sleep tracking will have to carve out time to charge the device before bed.
This is another strength of passive tracking. Sure, rings provide far less room in which to stick a battery, but the lack of power-hungry elements like displays go a long way toward extending battery life by a matter of days, not hours.
Oura rates the Ring 4 at up to eight days on a charge, up from the Ring 3’s seven. I made it through four days my first go-round before my phone sent an alert that I really ought to consider charging it up before bed. It didn’t hit the maximum suggested by Oura, but again, this is a totally different ballgame than Apple Watch numbers.
Activity tracking is a harder sell than sleep in the world of smart rings. The product’s lack of display is definitely a highlight when it comes to sleep hygiene, but daytime fitness is a different story altogether.
Oura has some features designed to engage the user, sent as notifications through the phone. After 50 minutes of sitting, for example, it will remind you to stretch your legs. It will also let you know when you’ve hit the halfway point toward your activity goals. These kinds of nudges aside, the smart ring doesn’t employ the sort of gamification strategy that has drawn many folks to wrist-worn devices.
It’s clear why so many Oura users opt to wear these devices together. Using the Ring 4 along with the Apple Watch Series 10 over this last week and change, it’s apparent that the products complement each other well. Rather than surfacing immediately actionable items, the Oura Ring is designed to monitor more gradual health trends over time.
Because of this, it generally takes a bit of wearing to develop a baseline to provide more complex insights. Beyond the heart rate monitoring and exercise minutes, Oura is striving to provide a fuller picture of health. This includes things like Readiness and Stress — factors that can’t be quantified with a single sensor’s metrics.
Oura has made clear that the Ring stands at the foundation of a broader health ecosystem play. That’s the motivation behind the company’s recent acquisition of Veri, which will find Oura planting its flag in the world of blood sugar monitoring. Smart ring manufacturers have demonstrated that a lot can be accomplished around the finger.
The company’s future is expanding on the metrics it collects and leveraging new tools like foundational models to provide more customized insights. For those things like glucose monitoring, which can’t be accomplished with the form factor, Oura will leverage third-party devices.
During my time with the new Ring, I found it worked quite well in concert with the Apple Watch, whether it’s incorporating workouts into its own stats or sending progress notifications to the wrist-worn device. The Oura Ring 4 is a minor upgrade over its predecessor, all told. If you picked up a Ring 3 in the past year, the FOMO shouldn’t keep you up at night. The biggest advance comes down to comfort, with its flush interior.
At the end of the day, Oura is a software play. That was evident when the company shifted to a subscription service early on, and it’s still clear as it rolls out new features by way of its Oura Labs testing platform. The Oura Ring is simply a handful of sensors wrapped around your finger. The real value is how that information is used."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/india-reliance-targets-2g-users-with-13-4g-phones-offering-streaming-payments/,India's richest man launches $13 4G phones to win 2G customers | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-10-15,"Reliance’s digital arm, Jio Platforms, has launched two new 4G-enabled handsets that offer access to live TV, music, and video streaming, as well as host the ability to make digital payments, all for a price tag of 1099 rupees ($13), as India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani pushes to woo the hundreds of millions of people who are still relying on slower 2G networks.
The JioBharat V3 and JioBharat V4, successors to last year’s JioBharat model, feature 1.77-inch displays, 48MB of RAM, 128MB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB), and 1,000mAh batteries. A company spokesperson told TechCrunch that Jio has manufactured the phones.
While these specs are decidedly entry-level, raw power isn’t the primary focus of these devices.
Instead, these phones represent Jio Platform’s strategic push to capture the next 100 million users in India — those for whom even a $50 smartphone remains out of reach. Hundreds of millions of Indians are still locked on 2G network.
Jio Platforms, backed by tech giants Google and Meta, already dominates as India’s largest telecom network with about 490 million paying subscribers. Its push with feature phones could further help the firm make deeper inroads in the world’s most populous nation.
The handsets — available to purchase from physical retail stores, JioMart and Amazon — feature access to JioTV, JioCinema, and JioSaavn. JioTV offers Jio subscribers access to over 450 channels at no additional charge. JioCinema is among the largest video streaming services in India and has exclusive tie-ups with NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. It also has the digital rights to stream the popular IPL cricket tournaments.
The JioBharat V3 and JioBharat V4 will only work on the Jio network — a strategy Reliance has been focusing on to make more people primarily reliant on its platform. In India, the vast majority of smartphones allow customers to have two SIM cards — contract with two carriers.
Jio’s feature phones are aimed at capturing “the new set of subscribers where Jio would be the primary connectivity provider and not the second SIM as it was in the urban market in FY17,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note last week.
“The phone is targeted at ~250 Mn customers in tier II and tier III cities and towns who have not been able to transition to 4G phones, in most cases due to the entry level prices of these phones. The new set of subscribers are also coming from this segment and Jio hopes to capture this segment.”
The voice and data monthly plan on JioBharat costs 123 rupees, or $1.5, and packs 14GB of data usage."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/european-cyber-insurance-startup-stoik-secures-27-million/,European cyber insurance startup Stoïk secures $27M | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-10-15,"Cyber risk has become an increasingly important issue for small companies around the world. While many companies try to avoid and mitigate cyber risks, they rarely discuss transferring those risks to a third party.
That’s why Stoïk is stepping in with a cybersecurity insurance product specifically designed for small- and medium-sized businesses. The French startup recently raised a €25 million Series B round (around $27 million at current exchange rates).
In many ways, Stoïk follows in the footsteps of companies like Coalition and At-Bay. However, instead of selling its insurance products to U.S.-based companies, Stoïk focuses exclusively on European companies.
Once insured by Stoïk, businesses are covered against cybersecurity-related claims. For instance, if a company needs to halt production or temporarily close due to a cyber incident, Stoïk can compensate for loss of revenue (gross operating margin) during that period.
Stoïk currently covers companies with annual turnover of €750 million or less and offers coverage limits of €7.5 million. At present, the company operates in France, Germany, and Austria.
The startup chose this particular vertical because cyber insurance is more complex than other types of insurance products. Stoïk has also built a small in-house crisis management team to respond to incidents and assist with data recovery and crisis communication.
“Since the beginning of the week, we’ve had a dozen attacks on our portfolio, including a major one,” co-founder and CEO Jules Veyrat told TechCrunch last week. “We have people mobilized in the Lyon region for a ransomware attack that brought an industrial company to a standstill.”
When customers sign up, they receive an overview of their cyber risk exposure. The startup monitors DNS records and scans online databases for password leaks associated with the customer’s domain name. Stoïk can also perform internal scans to recommend changes to cloud and active directory configurations.
“Our thesis is that we’re going to insure companies. On top of that, we’re going to help them better protect themselves against cyberattacks. That way, they’re happy, they get more for the same price, and we’re happy, because we have policyholders who are well protected, and therefore have fewer claims than others,” Veyrat said.
Stoïk still has some similarities with the broader insurance industry — it has to ensure it doesn’t accept too many bad apples in its portfolio of clients, as it could significantly impact the company’s loss ratio.
“The insurers’ job is to select the risk. So, who do I accept and under what conditions? How well do they understand cyber?” Veyrat said. “In other words, am I willing to take on a €50 million industrial company that has no offline backup strategy? This is just an example, but these are the questions we ask ourselves every day.”
Stoïk acts as a managing general agent (MGA), meaning that it works with insurance and reinsurance companies so that they cover the risks. Stoïk gets to create its own rates, products, and policies — but it outsources the risk to bigger insurance companies.
One such partner is Tokio Marine HCC International, which is the only new investor in the Series B funding round. Existing investors also invested in the round. Alven is leading the Series B with Andreessen Horowitz, Munich Re Ventures, Opera Tech Ventures, and Anthemis also participating.
Stoïk doesn’t sell its insurance products to its customers directly. Instead, it works with third-party insurance brokers that already have a relationship with SMBs. So far, Stoïk has attracted 1,000 insurance brokers.
By the end of 2024, Stoïk should have 5,000 policyholders. It currently represents €25 million in premiums and plans to ramp up customer signups in the future. The startup expects to expand into a new country every year starting with a new European market in late 2024 or early 2025."

The stock’s climb has been stupefying — surging nearly 180% this year, following a rapid climb last year; it’s also a reflection of Nvidia’s renowned stronghold on the AI chip market, 70% to 95% of which is controlled by the outfit, per estimates by Mizuho Securities. Indeed, with a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is now the second most valuable U.S. company, behind only Apple.
At the center of it all is Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, now himself worth an estimated $121.5 billion, per Forbes. The ride looks to continue, too. Alongside continuing demand for its current chips, Huang said earlier this month Nvidia is seeing “insane” demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips, which are slated to roll out in the fourth quarter. According to Morgan Stanley, which recently hosted meetings with Huang and other Nvidia execs, the chips are already sold out for the next 12 months."

We know Bubeck as one of the main authors of papers describing Microsoft’s Phi models, a series of extra-small language and vision models intended to help push AI applications to edge devices. That kind of expertise is increasingly important as large, centralized models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o give way in some markets to on-device models that work quickly, privately, and offline.
While Bubeck’s new role at OpenAI is still a mystery, it seems likely he’ll be working on the efficiency and small-model side of things — a corner of the AI world where OpenAI is currently less prominent."

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/google-signed-a-deal-to-power-data-centers-with-nuclear-micro-reactors-from-kairos-but-the-2030-timeline-is-very-optimistic/,Google signed a deal to power data centers with nuclear micro-reactors from Kairos — but the 2030 timeline is very optimistic | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,2024-10-14,"Google announced today that it has signed a deal with nuclear startup Kairos Power to build seven small reactors to supply electricity to its data centers. The agreement promises to add around 500 megawatts of carbon-free electricity at a time when energy demand for data centers and AI is surging.
The new power plants are scheduled to come online by the end of the decade, according to Google. It’s not clear whether the reactors would hook up to Google’s sites directly — an arrangement known as “behind the meter” — or if they would feed into the grid with Google claiming the carbon-free power by way of its agreement with Kairos.
With the deal, Google joins Microsoft and Amazon in turning to nuclear power to satiate its thirst for electricity. In September, Microsoft announced that it would pay Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island that was shuttered in 2019. Earlier this year, Amazon said it would build a hyperscale data center and directly connect it to another nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.
If Kairos can hit the 2030 deadline, it would be a slight revision to a recent forecast: As recently as July, the company was targeting commercial operations by “the early 2030s,” according to an article published by the U.S. Department of Energy. Even if Kairos can hit the revised target, it’s locked in a race with fusion startups, many of which are aiming to turn on commercial-scale power plants before 2035.
Kairos is one of a new breed of nuclear startups that are building small-modular reactors (SMR) in an attempt to lower the cost and speed the construction of nuclear power plants.
Most nuclear plants are massive installations, supplying 1,000 megawatts or more but taking years to plan and nearly a decade to build. The newest fission reactors in the U.S., Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia, were commissioned in 2023 and 2024, respectively, snapping a seven-year drought (the next newest reactor was commissioned in 2016). Still, they were seven years late and $17 billion over budget.
SMR startups are attempting to build nuclear power plants faster and cheaper by using mass production techniques to bring down costs and speed construction. Kairos tries to advance the technology a step further by cooling the reactor not with water but with molten salts of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved the startup’s plans for a 35-megawatt demonstration reactor, something that has eluded Oklo, another SMR startup.
Despite the regulatory nod, Kairos still faces significant challenges. No commercial small-modular reactors have been commissioned yet, which means the economics remain largely unproven. On top of that, Kairos’ molten salt design bucks decades of industry experience with water-cooled reactors.
But Kairos’s biggest challenge might not be technical at all. While 56% of Americans say they favor nuclear power, according to Pew Research, 44% remain opposed. The number opposed might rise when reactor sites are picked; the Pew survey only asked people if the U.S. should expand nuclear power generally, not in their backyards. What’s more, while support for nuclear power is near a recent high, far more people support wind and solar, two technologies that are available today and cost far less than new nuclear power plants."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/in-memory-of-steve-ohear/,In memory of Steve O'Hear | TechCrunch,TechCrunch Staff,2024-10-14,"TechCrunch has lost one of its beloved former colleagues. Steve O’Hear, who wrote for TechCrunch for more than a decade out of his hometown of London, has passed away after a short illness. He was 49.
It’s hard to put into words the remarkable talent that Steve was. Born with muscular dystrophy, he spent his life in a wheelchair and had significant health, mobility, and accessibility issues, but he was easily one of the most productive journalists any of us have ever worked with.
Steve brought his A-game to this organization every day he worked here and was a huge part of what made (and makes — you can read his 3,210 posts, a veritable magnum opus, here) TechCrunch great.
Steve was a dogged news hound who broke tons of stories. He also wrote grand features, spoke truth to power, and was, quite simply, an original and unmistakable voice.
Steve first joined TechCrunch in 2009, hired to help create a footprint for TechCrunch in Europe and conversely give the early tech ecosystem there exposure to the rest of the world.
Steve was fearless and more than a writer. Well before he came to TechCrunch, in 2004, fascinated by the gravity pull of Silicon Valley, even as far as Europe, he traveled to California with two friends in search of what made it tick and made a film about it. You can see that film here.
He was also a huge music lover who reveled in that world, too, building audio hardware and making music himself (as a keyboard player).
Like a lot of people who end up writing about startups, he also had a strong entrepreneurial streak. He left TechCrunch in late 2011 to co-found a semantic Q&A/search platform called Beepl. Alas, it didn’t toot enough horns. Eventually, Steve followed the great TechCrunch boomerang and came back here.
Steve was a natural at TechCrunch, deftly handling the two sides of what it means to work on a high-performing team.
He was fiercely independent, competitive, and proud of his work, relentlessly pursuing stories, twisting arms, developing leads, and spilling the beans — (usually!) with a smile, but taking no prisoners and without suffering fools. He was also a consummate team player and friend, collaborating and helping others with their work. In our permanently distributed virtual office, Steve was a wonderful person to banter with on Slack about ridiculous things we’d seen.
As tech grew and TechCrunch grew, so did Steve’s profile. He was an excellent onstage interviewer and he took on some iconic and some tricky, yet ultimately inspiring subjects over the years.
He eventually got the bug to do something different again and took a big veer back into startup land, working for quick commerce player Zapp.
The hard and fast rules of startup life turned him in a different direction eventually, and he once again started his own business, a communications consultancy called O’Hear & Co. As the firm said earlier, their plan is to continue with the vision Steve had.
It’s a huge loss, and he’s gone too soon. Our hearts, and our deepest sympathies, go out to his former colleagues, his friends, his wife Sara, and his family.

Connie Loizos, editor in chief of TechCrunch
I spent seven years working with Steve and while we were rarely in the same place at the same time, he seemed ubiquitous inside of TechCrunch, producing an impressive volume of work about up-and-coming founders in London and Berlin particularly, but also actively engaging in our own internal social channels to flag the news he was covering, share tips for others to chase down, and occasionally, good-humoredly, complain — as we all do in the news business — about our rivals.
He cared about TechCrunch, and TechCrunch cared about him. Among his parting words to all of us, in 2021, were these: “Thanks to everyone for making me feel valued and giving me the freedom to keep on learning and keep on scooping. If I had to give any advice to newcomers (not that you asked for it): TechCrunch is an amazing platform and like no other in this biz — use its special powers to do your best work and it will give you back double.”
Natasha Lomas
I only met Steve — professionally and in person — after I joined TechCrunch in 2012. But I soon realized I had already come across this guy on “the socials,” as he might have jokingly riffed back then. His strength of character and love of hustling meant he could play Twitter like a DJ dropping the big tunes at the club. Of course, he expected nothing less than the crowd to go wild. Mic drops were his bread and butter.
In person his character was no less large, no less magnetic than his social media self. While, professionally, I found — to my delight — I had acquired a colleague who was generous to a fault. Always happy to hear from you and genuinely interested to be a sounding board for story ideas. He also had a mentor’s keenness to help anyone who didn’t have his labyrinthine expertise of the ins and outs of VC funding — which was, in truth, most of the rest of his colleagues. Outside the fold, I suspect he didn’t suffer fools gladly. But for a guy of his whip-smart intelligence, you’d expect nothing less. Dear Steve, we already miss you so much.
The news of Steve’s death is a real shock. He rarely talked about his health. It was just like Steve to play that down — because he was busy turning the volume up on the rest of the world.
Devin Coldewey
I worked with Steve on and off for many years, and while we only got to talk in person a handful of times (as it is with many of my colleagues and friends here), I can credit him with igniting my interest in covering accessibility. Of course he covered countless other topics deeply, and I also learned about interview techniques from watching him. But he was a well-informed and passionate advocate for accessibility and critic of the tech industry’s historically rather slack approach to this vital issue. He set me right plenty of times over the years and I was sad to lose his expertise when he left TechCrunch; even sadder now that I’ll never get his insight again.
Romain Dillet
Steve was also the epitome of a curious person. When you thought you had him figured out, with his witty personality, he would surprise you with an unexpected move. In the late 2010s, he completely immersed himself in a new passion — music.
After spending a small fortune on synthesizers, sequencers, and other music equipment, he went so far as to record an album. You can still listen to Steve’s — or perhaps I should say Otis ‘Max’ Load’s — album on Spotify and Apple Music.
He described these 10 songs as his “debut solo/concept album with friends.” This phrase alone perfectly encapsulates Steve’s personality. He didn’t just want to record an album; it had to be a concept album. And it wasn’t just a solo album, it was a solo album … with friends.
Loving music is one thing, but loving music so much that you want to make music with friends and release it to the world is another. Steve had an irresistible urge to share his love of music with others.
And yes, “In Between Floors” was supposed to be his debut album …
Steve was a creative force with so much to share with the world. Many of his headlines and musical arrangements are still available on the internet. That’s the beauty of the web, a medium he cherished because it gave him the superpower to reach such a wide audience. It let him do what he loved. So let’s do the same."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/tesla-optimus-bots-were-controlled-by-humans-during-the-we-robot-event/,"Tesla Optimus bots were controlled by humans during the 'We, Robot' event | TechCrunch",Rebecca Bellan,2024-10-14,"During Tesla’s “We, Robot” event last week, which TechCrunch covered late into the night, sources on the ground sent me a handful of videos of the automaker’s Optimus humanoid robots walking around the party, dancing, mixing drinks, and talking to guests. Most, if not all, of those who attended the affair are Tesla investors and fans, and so it wasn’t surprising that the messages I received alongside the videos included glowing comments about how advanced the bots were.
I asked one investor, who sent me a video of an Optimus doing different voices on command, whether he thought it was remote controlled, or if it was perhaps, incredibly, powered by Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk’s xAI. He told me he thought it was indeed Grok enabling the bot to converse with him. Did he ask the bot how it was able to talk to him? No, he said. He was too blown away.
That appears to have been the point for Tesla – to inspire awe in a vision of the future. Others, including myself, were not as dazzled by what seems to have been sleight-of-hand at an event designed to engender enthusiasm among investors and fans.
Bloomberg, The Verge, and other outlets have reported that the bots were being remotely operated by humans, a conclusion that is easy enough to arrive at considering that they all had different voices and their responses and hand gestures were immediate and synchronized.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas also wrote in a report that the bots “relied on tele-ops (human intervention).”
Sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that while the Optimus prototypes were able to walk without external control using AI, employees stationed remotely oversaw many of the interactions between the bots and attendees during the “We, Robot” event.
At least one video from the event displayed an Optimus bartender acknowledging that it was being “assisted by a human.”
The humans controlling its bots raises questions over the capabilities of the technology, and whether they’ll be ready to go to market at a price tag of around $20,000 to $30,000 each any time soon.
“As you can see, we started up with someone in a robot suit, and then we’ve progressed dramatically year after year,” Musk said in his remarks last week. “So if you extrapolate this, you’re really going to have something spectacular, something that anyone could own, so you can have your own personal R2-D2 [or] C-3PO.”
“What can it do? It’ll be able to do anything you want,” the executive continued. “It can be a teacher, babysit your kids. It can walk your dog, mow your lawn, get the groceries, just be your friend, serve drinks. Whatever you can think of, it will do.”
It appears many investors were unconvinced by Tesla’s song and dance (literally – the bots did a choreographed dance). Tesla’s stock took an 11% hit Friday after the event, although that was also likely a response to Musk’s failure to provide insights into near-term revenue strategy for the Robotaxi as well as specific technological updates to FSD, the automaker’s advanced driver assistance system.
Some, however, remain unbothered by the bots being controlled by humans behind the scenes.
Analyst George Gianarikas at Canaccord Genuity wrote, “So What!” in a note to clients Monday.
“The dexterity shown and developmental progress exhibited by the robots were off the charts,” the analyst said. “And, as Mr. Musk has pointed out before, the robotics industry currently does not have a well-developed supply chain. That means that Tesla, with its internal manufacturing acumen, battery expertise, proficiency in motor design, electronics know-how, and mechanical engineering resources has the potential to create a vertically integrated robotics behemoth over the long term.”"

Buckley’s ambitions for this fund are significantly lower than for his previous one. He sought to raise a $500 million third fund in February 2022, right as the VC world hit a bear market. He raised $337 million for it, according to PitchBook data.
During the fundraising frenzy that peaked in 2021, Buckley became known as one of the solo venture capitalists, along with the likes of Lachy Groom, willing to offer startups better terms and higher prices than traditional VCs to win deals for coveted startups.
Some of Buckley’s high-profile bets didn’t pan out, like Airlift, a Pakistani logistics startup that shut down in 2022, about a year after Buckley co-led its $85 million Series B. Buckley didn’t respond to a request for comment."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/2024-in-data-breaches-1-billion-stolen-records-and-rising/,The biggest data breaches in 2024: 1 billion stolen records and rising | TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,2024-10-14,"We’re almost at the end of 2024, a year that will go down as having seen some of the biggest, most damaging data breaches in recent history. And just when you think that some of these hacks can’t get any worse, they do.
From huge stores of customers’ personal information getting scraped, stolen, and posted online, to reams of medical data covering most people in the United States getting stolen, the worst data breaches of 2024 have surpassed 1 billion stolen records and are rising. These breaches not only affect the individuals whose data was irretrievably exposed, but also embolden the criminals who profit from their malicious cyberattacks.
Travel with us to the not-so-distant past to look at how some of the biggest security incidents of 2024 went down, their impact, and, in some cases, how they could have been stopped.
For AT&T, 2024 has been a very bad year for data security. The telecoms giant confirmed not one, but two separate data breaches just months apart.
In July, AT&T said cybercriminals had stolen a cache of data that contained phone numbers and call records of “nearly all” of its customers, or around 110 million people, over a six-month period in 2022 and in some cases longer. The data wasn’t stolen directly from AT&T’s systems, but from an account it had with data giant Snowflake (more on that later).
Although the stolen AT&T data isn’t public (and one report suggests AT&T paid a ransom for the hackers to delete the stolen data) and the data itself does not contain the contents of calls or text messages, the “metadata” still reveals who called who and when, and in some cases the data can be used to infer approximate locations. Worse, the data includes phone numbers of non-customers who were called by AT&T customers during that time. That data becoming public could be dangerous for higher-risk individuals, such as domestic abuse survivors.
That was AT&T’s second data breach this year. Earlier in March, a data breach broker dumped online a full cache of 73 million customer records to a known cybercrime forum for anyone to see, some three years after a much smaller sample was teased online.
The published data included customers’ personal information, including names, phone numbers and postal addresses, with some customers confirming their data was accurate.
But it wasn’t until a security researcher discovered that the exposed data contained encrypted passcodes used for accessing a customer’s AT&T account that the telecoms giant took action. The security researcher told TechCrunch at the time that the encrypted passcodes could be easily unscrambled, putting some 7.6 million existing AT&T customer accounts at risk of hijacks. AT&T force-reset its customers’ account passcodes after TechCrunch alerted the company to the researcher’s findings.
One big mystery remains: AT&T still doesn’t know how the data leaked or where it came from.
In 2022, the U.S. Justice Department sued health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group to block its attempted acquisition of health tech giant Change Healthcare, fearing that the deal would give the healthcare conglomerate broad access to about “half of all Americans’ health insurance claims” each year. The bid to block the deal ultimately failed. Then, two years later, something far worse happened: Change Healthcare was hacked by a prolific ransomware gang; its almighty banks of sensitive health data were stolen because one of the company’s critical systems was not protected with multi-factor authentication.
The lengthy downtime caused by the cyberattack dragged on for weeks, causing widespread outages at hospitals, pharmacies and healthcare practices across the United States. But the aftermath of the data breach has yet to be fully realized, though the consequences for those affected are likely to be irreversible. UnitedHealth says the stolen data — which it paid the hackers to obtain a copy — includes the personal, medical and billing information on a “substantial proportion” of people in the United States.
The health giant’s chief executive, Andrew Witty, told lawmakers that the breach may affect around one-third of Americans, and potentially more. At least 100 million people are now known to be affected by the breach, but the final number is likely to rise.
A June cyberattack on U.K. pathology lab Synnovis — a blood and tissue testing lab for hospitals and health services across the U.K. capital — caused ongoing widespread disruption to patient services for weeks. The local National Health Service trusts that rely on the lab postponed thousands of operations and procedures following the hack, prompting the declaration of a critical incident across the U.K. health sector.
A Russia-based ransomware gang was blamed for the cyberattack, which saw the theft of data related to some 300 million patient interactions dating back a “significant number” of years. Much like the data breach at Change Healthcare, the ramifications for those affected are likely to be significant and life-lasting.
Some of the data was already published online in an effort to extort the lab into paying a ransom. Synnovis reportedly refused to pay the hackers’ $50 million ransom, preventing the gang from profiting from the hack but leaving the U.K. government scrambling for a plan in case the hackers posted millions of health records online.
One of the NHS trusts that runs five hospitals across London affected by the outages reportedly failed to meet the data security standards as required by the U.K. health service in the years that ran up to the June cyberattack on Synnovis.
A series of data thefts from cloud data giant Snowflake quickly snowballed into one of the biggest breaches of the year, thanks to the vast amounts of data stolen from its corporate customers.
Cybercriminals swiped hundreds of millions of customer data from some of the world’s biggest companies — including an alleged 560 million records from Ticketmaster, 79 million records from Advance Auto Parts and some 30 million records from TEG — by using stolen credentials of data engineers with access to their employer’s Snowflake environments. For its part, Snowflake does not require (or enforce) its customers to use the security feature, which protects against intrusions that rely on stolen or reused passwords.
Incident response firm Mandiant said around 165 Snowflake customers had data stolen from their accounts, in some cases a “significant volume of customer data.” Only a handful of the 165 companies have so far confirmed their environments were compromised, which also includes tens of thousands of employee records from Neiman Marcus and Santander Bank, and millions of records of students at Los Angeles Unified School District. Expect many Snowflake customers to come forward.
Cencora notifies over a million and counting that it lost their data:
U.S. pharma giant Cencora disclosed a February data breach involving the compromise of patients’ health data, information that Cencora obtained through its partnerships with drug makers. Cencora has steadfastly refused to say how many people are affected, but a count by TechCrunch shows well over a million people have been notified so far. Cencora says it’s served more than 18 million patients to date.
MediSecure data breach affects half of Australia:
Close to 13 million people in Australia — roughly half of the country’s population — had personal and health data stolen in a ransomware attack on prescriptions provider MediSecure in April. MediSecure, which distributed prescriptions for most Australians until late 2023, declared insolvency soon after the mass theft of customer data.
Kaiser shared health data on millions of patients with advertisers:
U.S. health insurance giant Kaiser disclosed a data breach in April after inadvertently sharing the private health information of 13.4 million patients, specifically website search terms about diagnoses and medications, with tech companies and advertisers. Kaiser said it used their tracking code for website analytics. The health insurance provider disclosed the incident in the wake of several  other telehealth startups, like Cerebral, Monument and Tempest, admitting they too shared data with advertisers.
USPS shared postal address with tech giants, too:
And then it was the turn of the U.S. Postal Service caught sharing postal addresses of logged-in users with advertisers like Meta, LinkedIn and Snap, using a similar tracking code provided by the companies. USPS removed the tracking code from its website after TechCrunch notified the postal service in July of the improper data sharing, but the agency wouldn’t say how many individuals had data collected. USPS has over 62 million Informed Delivery users as of March 2024.
Evolve Bank data breach affected fintech and startup customers:
A ransomware attack targeting Evolve Bank saw the personal information of more than 7.6 million people stolen by cybercriminals in July. Evolve is a banking-as-a-service giant serving mostly fintech companies and startups, like Affirm and Mercury. As a result, many of the individuals notified of the data breach had never heard of Evolve Bank, let alone have a relationship with the firm, prior to its cyberattack.
National Public Data goes broke after millions of SSNs stolen
The company behind the data broker National Public Data filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October, months after a massive data breach exposed some 3 billion records affecting around 270 million individuals, according to various analyses by security researchers. The data broker allowed its paying customers access to its vast databases of names, dates of birth, email and postal addresses, phone numbers, and Social Security numbers (even though not all of the data was accurate). The company said it had to file for bankruptcy, as it can no longer generate the revenue to address the deluge of class-action lawsuits and mounting liability from state and federal regulators.

This week I wanted to highlight a new startup that’s taking aim at a technology that’s been studied for decades but never materialized: space-based solar power.
Aetherflux, emerging from stealth Wednesday, says it is developing a novel design for space-based solar to unlock this energy source for the first time. The startup was founded by Baiju Bhatt, the co-founder of financial trading platform Robinhood, who said he became interested in the rapid commercialization of space. “The thing that’s always been my interest is, how do you bring more capitalism to space?”
If you’re bullish on hard tech as an investing category, then this will be very good news: I learned this week that Interlagos, the venture capital firm started by former senior SpaceX leaders, is looking to raise $550 million for its first venture fund.
Prospective LPs are no doubt drawn to the bona fides of the founding team, which includes Achal Upadhyaya, who was a senior engineer at SpaceX for a decade before leading investments in space and defense at Cantos Ventures; Tom Ochinero, a former high-ranking SpaceX executive who left the company in March after a 10-year stint; and Spencer Hemphill, Interlagos’ CFO, who was a former Sequoia finance leader.
This week in “women are awesome” news: Five years ago on October 18, NASA astronauts conducted the first-ever all women spacewalk! Astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch ventured outside the International Space Station to replace a faulty charge/discharge battery unit. This was Koch’s fourth spacewalk and the first for Meir.
Meir brushed off the accomplishment at the time, telling then-president Donald Trump, “We don’t want to take too much credit because there have been many others — female spacewalkers — before us,” Houston Public Media reported at the time. “This is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time … For us, this is really just us doing our job.”
At the time, 15 women had participated in 42 spacewalks, with cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya making the first venture outside the station in 1984.
Here’s some great footage from the agency showing the spacewalk in action."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/peanut-a-social-network-for-women-adds-a-pregnancy-tracking-tool/,"Peanut, a social network for women, adds a pregnancy tracking tool | TechCrunch",Aisha Malik,2024-10-14,"Peanut, a social networking app for women, is launching a new feature to help users track their pregnancies. The new Peanut Track tool leverages seven years of data from questions asked on the social network and uses AI to anticipate questions that women have during different stages of their pregnancy.
Founded in 2017, Peanut is an online community that is designed to connect women throughout all stages of their lives, from puberty to menopause. Now, the company is giving women personalized and anticipatory guidance tailored to each stage of pregnancy.
Up until now, Peanut has been focused on community and helping women connect with other women over shared experiences. With this new feature, Peanut is taking its first steps into the utility element of its service by helping women track their pregnancies individually.
“We’ve always been about community,” Peanut CEO and founder Michelle Kennedy told TechCrunch. “But, what about the times when I actually am not looking to engage with someone else, but am looking to source information. It’s really about serving you content which we know you’re going to ask because all these other women across the seven years that we have been going have been asking the same.”
Peanut Track offers content about what to expect during their current stage of pregnancy and what they should be thinking about in terms of well-being. The app will surface content written by gynecologists.
In addition, users can access all of the traditional metrics when it comes to pregnancy. For instance, Peanut Track will tell you if your baby is currently the size of a peach or a pumpkin. Plus, the feature will tell you what sorts of symptoms you may be experiencing.
Peanut Track stays true to Peanut’s core mission of community, as it also connects users with other women who are at the same stage of pregnancy as them.
The feature was requested by users, as Kennedy says Peanut is in a position where it can talk to its user base about what they want to see on the platform, and then work with them to implement their vision.
Following Peanut Track, the startup plans to launch Peanut Grow next year to help women anticipate the early stages of motherhood by tracking development and milestones.
“You can track your feed and your poops and all the other things that you have to do when you have a newborn,” Kennedy explained. “But also, what about you? How are you doing? How’s your mood? That kind of tracking is very important, particularly when you think about postpartum depression, loneliness — all of those other elements. I think it’s really important because what’s the point in telling someone, yes, we diagnose you as lonely without giving them the solution of ‘here are other women who are in exactly the same situation as you, and this too shall pass,’” she said.
Peanut has raised $32 million in funding to date. The company raised $10 million in a funding round in August 2022 that helped Peanut get to profitability. Before that, the company closed a $12 million Series A in May 2020."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/adobe-invites-you-to-embrace-the-tech-with-fireflys-new-video-generator/,Adobe invites you to 'embrace the tech' with Firefly's new video generator | TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,2024-10-14,"Adobe launched video generation capabilities for its Firefly AI platform ahead of its Adobe MAX event on Monday. Starting today, users can test out Firefly’s video generator for the first time on Adobe’s website, or try out its new AI-powered video feature, Generative Extend, in the Premiere Pro beta app.
On the Firefly website, users can try out a text-to-video model or an image-to-video model, both producing up to five seconds of AI-generated video. (The web beta is free to use, but likely has rate limits.)
Adobe says it trained Firefly to create both animated content and photo-realistic media, depending on the specifications of a prompt. Firefly is also capable of producing videos with text, in theory at least, which is something AI image generators have historically struggled to produce. The Firefly video web app includes settings to toggle camera pans, the intensity of the camera’s movement, angle, and shot size.
In the Premiere Pro beta app, users can try out Firefly’s Generative Extend feature to extend video clips by up to two seconds. The feature is designed to generate an extra beat in a scene, continuing camera motion and the subject’s movements. The background audio will also be extended — the public’s first taste of the AI audio model Adobe has been quietly working on. The background audio extender will not recreate voices or music, however, to avoid copyright lawsuits from record labels.
In demos shared with TechCrunch ahead of the launch, Firefly’s Generative Extend feature produced more impressive videos than its text-to-video model, and seemed more practical. The text-to-video and image-to-video model don’t quite have the same polish or wow factor as Adobe’s competitors in AI video, such as Runway’s Gen-3 Alpha or OpenAI’s Sora (though admittedly, the latter has yet to ship). Adobe says it put more focus on AI editing features than generating AI videos, likely to please its user base.
Adobe’s AI features have to strike a delicate balance with its creative audience. It’s trying to lead in a crowded space of AI startups and tech companies demoing impressive AI models. On the other hand, lots of creatives aren’t happy that AI features may soon replace the work they’ve done with their mouse, keyboard, and stylus for decades. That’s why Adobe’s first Firefly video feature, Generative Extend, uses AI to solve an existing problem for video editors — your clip isn’t long enough — instead of generating new video from scratch.
“Our audience is the most pixel perfect audience on Earth,” said Adobe’s VP of generative AI, Alexandru Costin, in an interview with TechCrunch. “They want AI to help them extend the assets they have, create variations of them, or edit them, versus generating new assets. So for us, it’s very important to do generative editing first, and then generative creation.”
Production-grade video models that make editing easier — that’s the recipe Adobe found early success with for Firefly’s image model in Photoshop. Adobe executives previously said Photoshop’s Generative Fill feature is one of the most used new features of the last decade, largely because it complements and speeds up existing workflows. The company hopes it can replicate that success with video.
Adobe is trying to be mindful to creatives, reportedly paying photographers and artists $3 for every minute of video they submit to train its Firefly AI model. That said, many creatives are still wary of using AI tools, or fear that they will make them obsolete. (Adobe on Monday also announced AI tools for advertisers to automatically generate content.)
Costin tells these concerned creatives that generative AI tools will create more demand for their work, not less: “If you think about the needs of companies wanting to create individualized and hyper personalized content for any user interacting with them, it’s infinite demand.”
Adobe’s AI lead says people should consider how other technological revolutions have benefited creatives, comparing the onset of AI tools to digital publishing and digital photography. He notes how these breakthroughs were originally seen as a threat, and says if creatives reject AI, they’re going to have a difficult time.
“Take advantage of generative capabilities to uplevel, upskill, and become a creative professional that can create 100 times more content using these tools,” said Costin. “The need of content is there, now you can do it without sacrificing your life. Embrace the tech. This is the new digital literacy.”
Firefly will also automatically insert “AI-generated” watermarks in the metadata of videos created this way. Meta uses identification tools on Instagram and Facebook to label media with these labels as AI-generated. The idea is that platforms or individuals can use AI identification tools like this, as long as content contains the appropriate metadata watermarks, to determine what is and isn’t authentic. However, Adobe’s videos will not by default have visible labels clarifying they are AI-generated in a way that’s easily read by humans.
Adobe specifically designed Firefly to generate “commercially safe” media. The company says it did not train Firefly on images and videos including drugs, nudity, violence, political figures, or copyrighted materials. In theory, this should mean that Firefly’s video generator will not create “unsafe” videos. Now that the internet has free access to Firefly’s video model, we’ll see if that’s true."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/aerleum-plans-to-turn-co2-directly-into-fuel-for-cargo-ships-and-eventually-airplanes/,"Aerleum plans to turn CO2 directly into fuel for cargo ships and, eventually, airplanes | TechCrunch",Tim De Chant,2024-10-14,"It only took four phone calls for Sébastien Fiedorow to quit his job as a venture capitalist.
The first one came from Marble, a startup studio based in Paris. They had a scientist looking for help founding a company that would remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere — what experts call direct air capture, or DAC.
“They approached the subject as being a DAC company, and I was like, ‘No, no way. I won’t go in that space,” Fiedorow told TechCrunch. “I didn’t want to invest in DAC.”
But he kept an open mind and met with the scientist, Steven Bardey. After a few meetings with his co-founder, he was “all in,” he said. “Once we dug into the numbers, once we did a back-of-the-napkin techno-economic assessment, that was the switching point for me.”
Fiedorow and Bardey started Aerleum in 2023 to refine the DAC technology that Bardey had been working on. Most DAC companies focus on the capture part of the process, designing what are essentially large sponges that can soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It’s not easy or cheap: Even at today’s elevated levels, CO2 represents just 0.04% of the air we breathe.
Once captured, many DAC startups then have to find a buyer for that carbon dioxide. They can compress it and sell it to oil companies, which force it into reservoirs to squeeze out more oil, thereby blunting it as a solution for climate change. Or they might sell it to a sequestration startup, which simply injects it deep into the Earth for storage. Still other companies might sell it to chemical companies, which transport it to their facilities and turn it into other compounds.
“Should we really have to get through all of these steps, or can we just bypass some of them?” Fiedorow said, describing his and Bardey’s thought process. “Where do you have the most energy penalties? It was really in the middle, the intermediate steps where you have to dissolve the CO2, compress it, and transport it.”
To cut out that step, Aerleum has developed a material that, in a two-step process, absorbs carbon dioxide and transforms it into another compound. The startup’s first target is methanol, an alcohol that can be burned as fuel in cargo ships or used as an ingredient to make other chemicals, including aviation fuel. The proprietary material is sponge-like, Fiedorow said, and inside the pores, a catalyst helps facilitate the chemical reactions that Aerleum is pursuing.
To capture carbon dioxide, Aerleum places the material into a sort of box that air can flow through. Once the material is saturated with carbon dioxide, the technology closes the box and starts pumping in hydrogen gas. The hydrogen then reacts with the carbon dioxide to produce gaseous methanol. The methanol is pumped out of the box and purified.
For now, Aerleum is focused on using the CO2 that’s already in the atmosphere, but Fiedorow said the company has run tests using up to 15% carbon dioxide, so it’s possible the material could be used to capture the gas from some industrial processes.
To build a pilot of its DAC device, Aerleum has raised $6 million in seed funding from 360 Capital and HTGF, with participation from Bpifrance, Marble, and Norrsken.
In the near term, the company hopes to be able to produce methanol using its process for less than $1,200 per metric ton. Right now, the cost of methanol ranges from around $380 to $780 per metric ton to buyers, depending on where they’re located.
In five years, Fiedorow said, the goal is to cut that nearly in half, to $650 per metric ton. “That’s where we start to be super competitive, even with fossil fuels,” he said."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/after-selling-his-last-ai-startup-to-meta-beyond-presences-founder-nabs-3-1m-to-build-realistic-avatars/,"After selling his last AI startup to Meta, Beyond Presence's founder nabs $3.1M to build lifelike avatars | TechCrunch",Ingrid Lunden,2024-10-14,"Computer vision applications are getting a huge boost from advances in smartphones combined with AI that helps fill in the gaps of what everyday devices cannot see. Using these tools, a startup out of Munich called Beyond Presence believes it holds the keys to what is coming next: Hyper-realistic avatars that look and sound exactly like their human counterparts and can be used in real-time, conversational situations.
The startup today said it raised its first outside funding, a pre-seed round of $3.1 million. German firm HV Capital is leading the round, with 10x Founders, Alba VC, and individuals from Meta, DeepMind, and Zalando also participating.
Beyond Presence hasn’t actually released its technology into the world just yet, but it is close, Awais Shafique, the startup’s CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch.
Part of the new capital will be used to continue developing the company’s foundational models, he said, and some will fund the release of its public beta by the end of this month.
So far, some 300 companies are on the waitlist for the product, which will likely have early applications in areas like customer service and support, recruitment, sales, and e-learning. All of these are areas in which companies are looking to scale up interactions with users without having to hire and train more people.
So, how has a startup managed to raise a multimillion-dollar round even before it’s launched a product, and come this far as a resource-intensive AI company without any outside funding? The answer lies in the founders’ backgrounds.
Shafique previously co-founded Presize, a computer vision startup that could accurately take a user’s measurements by recording a clip of the user turning around once in front of a smartphone camera. Those measurements could then be used to help buy apparel online. The Munich-based startup had an outsized profile in its home country because the founders participated in the German TV version of “Dragons Den”/“Shark Tank” in 2020, where they raised a record-breaking €650,000.
Then in April 2022, it emerged that Meta had acquired Presize. The price and exact date of the transaction were never disclosed, but some strong signals point to a great exit.
SEC filings show that Meta spent between $774 million from January to March 2022, and $1.15 billion in the first six months of 2022, on acquisitions. Presize was the only deal publicly disclosed at that time. Wikipedia’s list of Meta acquisitions, meanwhile, has been edited with a much more modest estimate: $100 million.
Sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that a deal value in the lower nine figures was more accurate than 10 figures in this case.
Regardless of where Presize fell in that range, given that the startup had only raised “a couple of million,” in Shafique’s estimate, he and his co-founders exited very well.
“It’s lucrative enough that we don’t have to work,” he said in an interview.
(They’re all still working anyway. In addition to Shafique’s latest startup, Presize’s other co-founders, Leon Szeli and Tomislav Tomov, are still at Meta, working on its generative AI projects. They remain in contact with Shafique, though, as both are investing in Beyond Presence.)
At its heart, Presize was aiming to solve a thorny computer vision problem, and that is what Beyond Presence is aiming to do as well.
Admittedly, my initial thoughts about Beyond Presence’s pitch were skeptical.
Digital avatars are not exactly uncharted territory. Not only have they been around for decades, but they have been getting a boost of attention more recently — and maybe some hype — with the latest innovations in AI and processing, not to mention the craze for all things chatbot.
There are also no clear ideas of what will work in the realm of avatars as a long-term business. Some, like Hyper and Ready Player Me (backed respectively by Amazon and a16z), are drawing from gaming culture and the theory that avatars should not be realistic versions of the people using them. Those who want to hide their identities to preserve their privacy might opt for these approaches over those that replicate their exact likeness.
Others, like Synthesia, can create likenesses of people, alongside tech that also uses everyday devices like phone cameras to capture your expressions to power avatars that do not look like you. However, these (at least for now) cannot be used for real-time, live interactions.
Others building tools that you can interact with using everyday devices include Veed and Deepbrain.
Beyond Presence is aiming for not only an avatar that can be created on-the-fly using your phone, but one that looks like you and can be used in real-time, unscripted conversational situations. Something like a video version of the text-based chatbots offered by OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta and many others.
The startup is not the only one in this space, of course. Zoom appears to be working on hyper-realistic custom avatars, and CommonGround is also developing something along similar lines.
For now, Beyond Presence is focusing on building something unique in the video component of its product.
Eleven Labs is powering the voice part of the experience, and OpenAI’s GPT is the generative AI model powering the content. Business customers can flexibly change which model they use.
“You can also leave everything up to us, [or use] any LLM that you would like, or any voice agent that you would like. And then we do the face on top of it,” he said. This feature addresses the fact that enterprise customers might already be working with particular LLM providers, for example, or do not want to share any proprietary data externally, he noted.
There’s an interesting detail about Beyond Presence’s early decisions around funding: It turns out that the company was accepted to participate in Y Combinator earlier this year, but opted out of the prestigious incubator.
Although YC definitely gives access to great networks, Shafique and his co-founder Felix Altenberger (CTO; and a former deep learning specialist at Presize) chose not to give up equity and autonomy to access that.
While YC partners might have had their own input on how to grow the company with sales, Shafique said he and Altenberger had a “horizontal” approach they wanted to pursue.
“We wanted to move more on the core technology and foundation model layer,” he said.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/table-space-eyes-2-5b-valuation-in-india-ipo/,Table Space eyes $2.5B valuation in India IPO | TechCrunch,Manish Singh,2024-10-14,"Table Space, an Indian managed workspace provider, is targeting a valuation of $2.5 billion or more for an IPO planned for next year, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.
The Bengaluru-headquartered startup has hired Axis as a bookrunner for the IPO, the sources said.
Founded in 2017, Table Space leases large office spaces, transforms them into fully serviced, tech-enabled campuses, and offers them to corporate clients as customized offices, co-working spaces, and managed meeting rooms. Hillhouse Capital invested $300 million in Table Space in a funding round in late 2022, and the startup is currently valued at about $550 million.
The company operates more than 60 centers across six urban Indian cities, primarily serving Fortune 500 companies such as Apple, Google, Mastercard, PayPal, AMD, Ericsson and Shell. The startup has expanded its real estate portfolio to over 9.5 million square feet across major Indian cities, and aims to nearly double this footprint within three years by investing about $535 million.
Table Space declined to comment.
In a recent interview with an Indian daily, the company’s co-founder and president Kunal Mehra said the company expects annual revenue to reach nearly $600 million by March 2027.
Table Space’s IPO and expansion plans come at a time of mild uncertainty in the global flexible workspace sector. While WeWork’s high-profile struggles have cast doubts on the viability of the co-working space business model around the world, demand for flexible office spaces in major Indian cities remains strong, driven by a growing technology sector and multinational corporations seeking to reduce long-term lease commitments.
Table Space’s plans for the IPO also follow the stellar public debut of Awfis, a Peak XV-backed co-working space provider whose stock has surged nearly 70% in the five months since its IPO. Many startups, including WeWork India, IndiQube, and Simpliwork, are also in various stages of deliberations to go public.
The Indian market has delivered more tech IPOs this year than the U.S. as valuation multiples approach all-time highs in the South Asian market. Indian firms have raised more than $9 billion via IPOs and FPOs this year, even as growth-stage startup deals remain muted."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/constellation-technologies-operations-wants-to-work-with-telecom-operators-to-deliver-5g-internet-from-space/,Constellation Technologies & Operations wants to work with telecom operators to deliver 5G internet from space | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-14,"The telecom industry is undergoing its greatest period of disruption since the telegraph, as companies work to open up space as the next frontier for communications. French startup Constellation hopes to take part by repurposing 5G tech to provide a Starlink-like satellite broadband that uses telecoms’ existing assets.
Constellation Technologies & Operations, to call it by its full name, plans to launch a constellation of satellites in very low Earth orbit and work directly with telecom operators to provide high-speed internet access via small (but stationary) user terminals.
The company would do this by repurposing terrestrial 5G spectrum for space-based connectivity — cellular signals can actually reach to and from orbit if handled right. Constellation would provide the capacity and terminals but the customer would pay the telecom company for the service, with that subscription revenue shared.
Constellation founder and CEO Charles Delfieux acknowledged in a recent interview that the space sector is at a turning point: “For the first time in the history of space and telecommunication, we are basically witnessing a convergence between space and terrestrial connectivity in terms of performance and price,” he said. “That convergence is basically making those sought-after, cost-effective solutions to deliver connectivity as something that is completely achievable.”
An engineer by training, Delfieux spent the majority of his career working at the World Bank, where he acted as program manager leading the structuring and financing of large infrastructure projects in emerging countries. He witnessed firsthand how access to reliable internet remains a challenge for millions of people. With the support of a first investor, he resigned from the World Bank and founded Constellation in 2022.
“If you want to really achieve ubiquitous, universal connectivity, the only way to do that is to leverage space technologies,” he said.
He acknowledged that the most successful example to date is Starlink, whose performance and price is getting closer and closer to what terrestrial solutions provide. But Delfieux said the Constellation team eventually realized that the most promising business plan is to essentially work with, not against, terrestrial telecom operators. By doing so, he sees massive opportunity to provide universal internet access regardless of location or existing connectivity.
The plan is bolstered by some technological innovations, namely the development of a satellite form factor that will be capable of operating in very low Earth orbit, around 375 kilometers, which Delfieux says will help boost the performance of the system. Constellation also aims to repurpose part of the 5G spectrum allocated to the telecom operators on the ground for its space communications service.
By doing so, Delfieux said the startup will help telecoms to monetize the full extent of their 5G networks — and more meaningfully compete with new entrants like SpaceX and Amazon’s Kuiper.
“Established national, regional, traditional telecom operators, they are seeing these very powerful, very influential players, new entrants in telecommunications sector, that start operating a broadband constellation, that start delivering broadband services from space…they are more and more aiming at taking their own space within the telecommunication sector, in direct competition with established national and regional telecom operators. So it’s a threat. We basically want to be the ones providing a telco-friendly solution for the telecom operator. So tomorrow they can compete with those new entrants.”
By using 5G spectrum, Constellation can also integrate within the design of its user terminals and satellite payloads mass-produced, cheap components that are already being produced for terrestrial communication networks in order to drive down costs, he added.
The company has secured a €9.3 million ($10.2 million) seed round to accelerate its plans. The new funding comes from Expansion Ventures, Bpifrance and a previous unnamed investor.
Constellation estimates that its business model will need a constellation of 1,500 satellites to provide global coverage — an ambitious number by any measure — with performance rates of 150 Mbps downlink and 50 Mbps uplink and a latency of less than 30 milliseconds.
The company plans first on launching a hosted payload to orbit by June 2025 to carry out an end-to-end test of the service. From there, it will launch two prototype satellites by the end of 2026 with the aim of deploying production satellites the following year."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/rerail-is-a-new-fintech-focused-angel-fund-from-cocoas-anthony-danon/,Rerail is a new fintech-focused angel fund from Cocoa’s Anthony Danon | TechCrunch,Romain Dillet,2024-10-14,"If you’re starting a fintech company, there’s a new, small, early-stage fund looking for investment opportunities. Founded by Anthony Danon (pictured above), Rerail could be called a micro-fund, a solo GP fund, or an angel fund.
Danon has been an investor for the past 10 years. He started his career with Anthemis Group in London back in 2014 and worked on some interesting rounds, such as TrueLayer’s seed round.
He quickly climbed the VC ladder to become a partner at Speedinvest with a specific focus on fintech. He invested in promising startups, such as Primer and Wayflyer.
“I like this notion that fintech is a horizontal, not a vertical. It’s the support function of all markets. So instead of thinking neobanks, lending, and payments, think about health and insurance, logistics, and trade,” Danon told TechCrunch.
In 2021, he started talking with Carmen Alfonso Rico to launch a fund together. “Carmen and I were friends because we started in VC around the same time,” Danon said. “And we realized we had seen the same thing as collaborative investors. On the one hand, all these VCs are friends of ours that we’ve kind of grown up with. And they’re collaborating quite intensely the moment we’re not competing with them … And on the other, we could leverage that to the founders.”
They launched Cocoa around three years ago as a small early-stage fund designed to invest like an angel investor — Cocoa is never the lead investor but it can bring other investors to help you get your startup off the ground.
After 35 investments, when it was time to decide what to do next, the duo decided to part ways and raise separate funds. As Cocoa’s investment thesis isn’t exclusively around fintech, it wasn’t the right fit for Danon; he wanted to focus even more on fintech and fintech-adjacent startups — and also not just in Europe.
“Our strategy focus was a bit diverging, and so we said: ‘Look it’s a tough decision but let’s decide to do the next one separately,’” Danon said. He didn’t want to say more about Carmen Alfonso Rico’s (and Cocoa’s) future. “Carmen’s in the process of her next thing,” he said.
A person working with Alfonso Rico told TechCrunch she continues in her role as founder of Cocoa, actively investing and further building the firm.
And this brings us to Rerail, a fund with a $20 million target. Danon has already done a first close just above that target at around $20.5 million. He’s going to raise a bit more than that so the final number is going to be a bit above that number. “The majority of the LP base is founders and operators, which is very core to the DNA and all of the value I bring to the table,” Danon said. “But then I also have some institutions.”
Danon plans to invest anything from $200,000 to $500,000 depending on the size of the funding round. He has made his first investment with Rerail, but he doesn’t want to name the startup just yet.
In addition to Danon’s network of founders and ability to bring investors to the cap table, he also hopes that he can give some useful advice to founders who are just getting started.
“I never pretend I know better than the founders. I learn from them, but they speak the same language,” he said. “And when it comes to network and concentration, I hope we can open almost every door.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/13/director-morgan-neville-is-steering-clear-of-generative-ai-after-roadrunner-backlash/,Director Morgan Neville is steering clear of generative AI after ‘Roadrunner’ backlash | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-10-13,"One of the most attention-grabbing aspects of “Roadrunner,” the Morgan Neville-directed documentary about Anthony Bourdain, was Neville’s use of generative AI to replicate Bourdain’s voice.
Looking back now, Neville told Wired that he saw this as a “fun” way to “keep [Bourdain’s] voice going in the film.” But his approach drew intense criticism — while the synthetic Bourdain only read words that the real Bourdain had actually written, Neville said many viewers assumed, “Oh, they just made [expletive] up.”
“Many people told me that there were other documentary projects that were doing the same thing, that all reacted; they either changed what they were doing or put giant disclaimers over everything,” he said.
Since then, the director has “assiduously avoided” using AI. Even in his new documentary, “Piece by Piece,” in which he dramatizes musician Pharrell’s life with Legos (yes, really), Neville was careful to steer clear.
“Carl Sagan in [Piece by Piece] says, ‘Pharrell’ and I was very clear to everybody that we were, with permission of his widow, going to make him say ‘Pharrell’ without using AI,” Neville said. “We actually experimented to construct the word from syllables [he actually said].”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/13/spacex-will-attempt-historic-catch-of-returning-starship-booster-on-sunday/,SpaceX successfully catches returning Starship booster | TechCrunch,Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-10-13,"For the first time, SpaceX not only launched its mammoth Starship, but also returned the booster to the launch site and caught it with a pair of oversized “chopsticks.”
This test flight — the fifth in the Starship development program —  took place Sunday morning at the company’s Starbase site in southeast Texas. The nearly 400-foot-tall Starship is at the centerpiece of SpaceX’s stated ambition to make life multi-planetary, but more immediately NASA’s ambitious Artemis campaign to return humans to the surface of the moon.
SpaceX envisions rapid reuse of the entire Starship vehicle, which includes an upper stage (also called Starship) and a Super Heavy booster — but that means proving out the capability to recover both stages and quickly refurbish them for future flights.
So it makes sense that the primary objectives for this fifth flight test were two-fold: attempting the first-ever “catch” of the Super Heavy booster at the launch site and an on-target Starship reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.
The latter goal had already been achieved: SpaceX nailed a controlled reentry and splashdown of the Starship upper stage during the last test mission in June. But the booster catch, as the company put it in a blog post, would be “singularly novel” in the history of rocketry.
The closest analogue is the now-routine Falcon 9 booster landings on autonomous barges and terrestrial landing zones. In today’s launch, the booster slowed to a hover and gently positioned itself inside the zone of two “chopstick” arms attached to the launch tower. Those arms then closed around the booster and held it up after its engines stop firing.
You can see the catch at around 40 minutes into SpaceX’s video of the test. Following the booster detachment and catch, Starship continued to ascend into orbit before splashing in the Indian Ocean and exploding (SpaceX had not planned to recover the spacecraft).
SpaceX noted in an update posted on its website that “thousands” of criteria showing healthy systems across the vehicle and pad had to be met for the catch attempt to occur. This test also took place a little sooner than expected: The Federal Aviation Administration had previously said that it did not anticipate issuing a modified launch license for this test before late November.
That timeline gave much umbrage to SpaceX, leading the company to repeatedly call out what it characterized as the regulator’s inefficiency. But the FAA announced on Saturday that it had approved the launch.
“The FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the suborbital test flight,” the regulator said in a statement. Notably, the authorization also includes approval for the next test flight, given that “the changes requested by SpaceX for Flight 6 are within the scope of what has been previously analyzed,” the FAA said.
While awaiting this launch license, SpaceX engineers have stayed very busy: In recent months, they have conducted numerous tests on the launch tower, completely replaced the rocket’s entire thermal protection system with newer tiles and a backup ablative layer, and updated the ship’s software for reentry. This week, engineers completed propellant loading tests and testing of the launch pad’s water deluge system, which is meant to protect the pad from the powerful fire of the booster’s 33 Raptor engines.
The company eventually plans on bringing the Starship upper stage back to the landing site too, though we’ll have to wait to see that in future test launches.
“With each flight building on the learnings from the last, testing improvements in hardware and operations across every facet of Starship, we’re on the verge of demonstrating techniques fundamental to Starship’s fully and rapidly reusable design,” the company says. “By continuing to push our hardware in a flight environment, and doing so as safely and frequently as possible, we’ll rapidly bring Starship online and revolutionize humanity’s ability to access space.”
Anthony Ha contributed to this report, which has been updated to reflect the successful test flight."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/13/apple-might-release-a-2000-vision-headset-next-year/,"Apple might release a $2,000 Vision headset next year | TechCrunch",Anthony Ha,2024-10-13,"Apple’s Vision Pro hasn’t exactly reshaped the market, but the company isn’t giving up on headsets that combine the digital and real worlds.
A new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says that Apple’s next big mixed reality release could come as early as next year, with the launch of a Vision headset costing around $2,000 — not exactly cheap, but more affordable than the $3,500 Vision Pro. To achieve this price, Apple would use cheaper materials and a less powerful processor, and it would not include the EyeSight feature that shows a user’s eyes outside the headset.
Next up would be a second-generation Vision Pro in 2026, and then potentially smart glasses (akin to Meta’s Ray-Bans) and AirPods with cameras in 2027.
The same report offers an update on Apple’s smart home strategy. The company hasn’t had much success here, either, but there are reportedly plans for “an affordable iPad-like screen” that could be placed around the house to watch TV, make FaceTime calls, and use apps. This would be followed by a tabletop device with a robot arm, which could cost around $1,000."
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/13/the-promise-and-perils-of-synthetic-data/,The promise and perils of synthetic data | TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,2024-10-13,"Is it possible for an AI to be trained just on data generated by another AI? It might sound like a harebrained idea. But it’s one that’s been around for quite some time — and as new, real data is increasingly hard to come by, it’s been gaining traction.
Anthropic used some synthetic data to train one of its flagship models, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Meta fine-tuned its Llama 3.1 models using AI-generated data. And OpenAI is said to be sourcing synthetic training data from o1, its “reasoning” model, for the upcoming Orion.
But why does AI need data in the first place — and what kind of data does it need? And can this data really be replaced by synthetic data?
AI systems are statistical machines. Trained on a lot of examples, they learn the patterns in those examples to make predictions, like that “to whom” in an email typically precedes “it may concern.”
Annotations, usually text labeling the meaning or parts of the data these systems ingest, are a key piece in these examples. They serve as guideposts, “teaching” a model to distinguish among things, places, and ideas.
Consider a photo-classifying model shown lots of pictures of kitchens labeled with the word “kitchen.” As it trains, the model will begin to make associations between “kitchen” and general characteristics of kitchens (e.g. that they contain fridges and countertops). After training, given a photo of a kitchen that wasn’t included in the initial examples, the model should be able to identify it as such. (Of course, if the pictures of kitchens were labeled “cow,” it would identify them as cows, which emphasizes the importance of good annotation.)
The appetite for AI and the need to provide labeled data for its development have ballooned the market for annotation services. Dimension Market Research estimates that it’s worth $838.2 million today — and will be worth $10.34 billion in the next 10 years. While there aren’t precise estimates of how many people engage in labeling work, a 2022 paper pegs the number in the “millions.”
Companies large and small rely on workers employed by data annotation firms to create labels for AI training sets. Some of these jobs pay reasonably well, particularly if the labeling requires specialized knowledge (e.g. math expertise). Others can be backbreaking. Annotators in developing countries are paid only a few dollars per hour on average, without any benefits or guarantees of future gigs.
So there’s humanistic reasons to seek out alternatives to human-generated labels. But there are also practical ones.
Humans can only label so fast. Annotators also have biases that can manifest in their annotations, and, subsequently, any models trained on them. Annotators make mistakes, or get tripped up by labeling instructions. And paying humans to do things is expensive.
Data in general is expensive, for that matter. Shutterstock is charging AI vendors tens of millions of dollars to access its archives, while Reddit has made hundreds of millions from licensing data to Google, OpenAI, and others.
Lastly, data is also becoming harder to acquire.
Most models are trained on massive collections of public data — data that owners are increasingly choosing to gate over fears their data will be plagiarized, or that they won’t receive credit or attribution for it. More than 35% of the world’s top 1,000 websites now block OpenAI’s web scraper. And around 25% of data from “high-quality” sources has been restricted from the major datasets used to train models, one recent study found.Should the current access-blocking trend continue, the research group Epoch AI projects that developers will run out of data to train generative AI models between 2026 and 2032. That, combined with fears of copyright lawsuits and objectionable material making their way into open datasets, has forced a reckoning for AI vendors.
At first glance, synthetic data would appear to be the solution to all these problems. Need annotations? Generate ’em. More example data? No problem. The sky’s the limit.
And to a certain extent, this is true.
“If ‘data is the new oil,’ synthetic data pitches itself as biofuel, creatable without the negative externalities of the real thing,” Os Keyes, a PhD candidate at the University of Washington who studies the ethical impact of emerging technologies, told TechCrunch. “You can take a small starting set of data and simulate and extrapolate new entries from it.”
The AI industry has taken the concept and run with it.
This month, Writer, an enterprise-focused generative AI company, debuted a model, Palmyra X 004, trained almost entirely on synthetic data. Developing it cost just $700,000, Writer claims — compared to estimates of $4.6 million for a comparably-sized OpenAI model.
Microsoft’s Phi open models were trained using synthetic data, in part. So were Google’s Gemma models. Nvidia this summer unveiled a model family designed to generate synthetic training data, and AI startup Hugging Face recently released what it claims is the largest AI training dataset of synthetic text.
Synthetic data generation has become a business in its own right — one that could be worth $2.34 billion by 2030. Gartner predicts that 60% of the data used for AI and an­a­lyt­ics projects this year will be syn­thet­i­cally gen­er­ated.
Luca Soldaini, a senior research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, noted that synthetic data techniques can be used to generate training data in a format that’s not easily obtained through scraping (or even content licensing). For example, in training its video generator Movie Gen, Meta used Llama 3 to create captions for footage in the training data, which humans then refined to add more detail, like descriptions of the lighting.
Along these same lines, OpenAI says that it fine-tuned GPT-4o using synthetic data to build the sketchpad-like Canvas feature for ChatGPT. And Amazon has said that it generates synthetic data to supplement the real-world data it uses to train speech recognition models for Alexa.
“Synthetic data models can be used to quickly expand upon human intuition of which data is needed to achieve a specific model behavior,” Soldaini said.
Synthetic data is no panacea, however. It suffers from the same “garbage in, garbage out” problem as all AI. Models create synthetic data, and if the data used to train these models has biases and limitations, their outputs will be similarly tainted. For instance, groups poorly represented in the base data will be so in the synthetic data.
“The problem is, you can only do so much,” Keyes said. “Say you only have 30 Black people in a dataset. Extrapolating out might help, but if those 30 people are all middle-class, or all light-skinned, that’s what the ‘representative’ data will all look like.”
To this point, a 2023 study by researchers at Rice University and Stanford found that over-reliance on synthetic data during training can create models whose “quality or diversity progressively decrease.” Sampling bias — poor representation of the real world — causes a model’s diversity to worsen after a few generations of training, according to the researchers (although they also found that mixing in a bit of real-world data helps to mitigate this).
Keyes sees additional risks in complex models such as OpenAI’s o1, which he thinks could produce harder-to-spot hallucinations in their synthetic data. These, in turn, could reduce the accuracy of models trained on the data — especially if the hallucinations’ sources aren’t easy to identify.
“Complex models hallucinate; data produced by complex models contain hallucinations,” Keyes added. “And with a model like o1, the developers themselves can’t necessarily explain why artefacts appear.”
Compounding hallucinations can lead to gibberish-spewing models. A study published in the journal Nature reveals how models, trained on error-ridden data, generate even more error-ridden data, and how this feedback loop degrades future generations of models. Models lose their grasp of more esoteric knowledge over generations, the researchers found — becoming more generic and often producing answers irrelevant to the questions they’re asked.
A follow-up study shows that other types of models, like image generators, aren’t immune to this sort of collapse:
Soldaini agrees that “raw” synthetic data isn’t to be trusted, at least if the goal is to avoid training forgetful chatbots and homogenous image generators. Using it “safely,” he says, requires thoroughly reviewing, curating, and filtering it, and ideally pairing it with fresh, real data — just like you’d do with any other dataset.
Failing to do so could eventually lead to model collapse, where a model becomes less “creative” — and more biased — in its outputs, eventually seriously compromising its functionality. Though this process could be identified and arrested before it gets serious, it is a risk.
“Researchers need to examine the generated data, iterate on the generation process, and identify safeguards to remove low-quality data points,” Soldaini said. “Synthetic data pipelines are not a self-improving machine; their output must be carefully inspected and improved before being used for training.”
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman once argued that AI will someday produce synthetic data good enough to effectively train itself. But — assuming that’s even feasible — the tech doesn’t exist yet. No major AI lab has released a model trained on synthetic data alone.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/13/the-original-source-code-for-backyard-baseball-is-long-gone-mega-cat-studios-remastered-the-game-anyway/,The original source code for Backyard Baseball is long gone. Mega Cat Studios remastered the game anyway. | TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,2024-10-13,"Backyard Baseball 1997 is back in all of its nostalgic glory, sliding onto Steam like Pablo Sanchez when he steals a base. But before Mega Cat Studios could remaster the cult favorite PC game, founder James Deighan had to sift through almost 30 years of detritus.
Playground Productions, a children’s media company, scored the rights to the Backyard Sports games, which were originally put out by Humongous Entertainment for Windows PCs. But the now-defunct video game developer didn’t do a great job at archiving its software when it was bought, sold, and dismantled for parts during the 2000s.
“[Playground] sent us this massive box of Zip disks and files and CD ROMs and just all sorts of things from over the years,” Deighan told TechCrunch. He sifted through the materials with Luke Usher, an engineer who specializes in emulators (programs that allow computers or other devices to imitate video game consoles, like an iPhone app that lets you play Pokémon). But Usher and Deighan discovered a key problem.
“I noticed that the source code was missing for the games that we were trying to work with,” Usher told TechCrunch. “So we got a hold of a copy of the disc of Baseball ’97, then started from there, and then it became apparent that we’d need to modify the game to get it to run nicely on modern systems. So I started searching the web to see if anybody had worked with that game before.”
That’s how they met John Simon, an engineer who had been modding the Backyard Sports games for fun.
“It’s just something I do from time to time when I really like a game. I play the game, I beat the game, and you know, the replay value is gone, but I haven’t had enough,” Simon told TechCrunch. “So what do you do? For me as a programmer, as a reverse engineer, it’s fun to just go in and dig into the source and see if there are any developer secrets left behind, or incomplete content, the kind of stuff you see on the cutting room floor.”
When Deighan leads projects like this, where a retro game is being brought back to life, he tries to hire from within the fan communities of those games.
“One of the first things we do is we extend the Mega Cat team with people that have already been living in that space for some number of years,” Deighan said. This was also true of a project Mega Cat worked on with NES Mike Tyson games. “So as an example, when we worked on Mike Tyson [i.e. Punch-Out!! for NES], we were working closely with Mike Tyson ROM hackers, and speedrunners, and people that know every single corner of it, because they often end up being not only 20 times more passionate, but much more knowledgeable.”
Simon’s expertise with the Backyard Sports franchise proved especially useful, since it’s built within SCUMM, an obsolete game engine that LucasArts released in 1987.
“There might be maybe two dozen people globally that are actively contributing to or working in [SCUMM],” Deighan said. “It’s very much like a legacy artifact from a previous era.”
Even at the time of Backyard Baseball’s original release, SCUMM was already phasing out of use.
“Somehow, the Humongous developers back in the 90s, they built a 3D game inside of this 2D game engine,” Simon said. “Somehow they turned it into a sports game — it’s kind of an insane achievement, especially back in 1997.”
Simon was able to modify assets and scripts from Backyard Baseball using ScummVM, an open source interpreter of the game engine (the programmer behind the 2001 software, Ludvig Strigeus, went on to become one of Spotify’s first developers). But Mega Cat still had the problem of getting the retooled Backyard Baseball to run on modern devices. That was Usher’s job.
“That involved basically building a framework that can hijack the game when you try to run it, take over the control, and then run our own code before the game code starts, and use it as an opportunity to apply patches, make changes, fix bugs, hook into Steam, that kind of thing,” he said. “So the game doesn’t really know it’s been modified, but we jump in before it has a chance to start.”
Although Mega Cat’s team spent a lot of time in the weeds on the kinds of niche issues that crop up with retro gaming, they didn’t lose sight of the joy of bringing Backyard Baseball back to life. The game has such an enduring fanbase that even the Kelce brothers looked into buying the rights.
“Some of us were doing these things for free for 10 years, so it’s kind of a dream type of project to be a part of,” Deighan said. “It’s such a fun sleeper hit for fandom, for people to kind of hit that nostalgia button and go back in time.”
The tension with Backyard Baseball, though, is that most of its fans, who played the game when they were young, are now in their 20s and 30s. So, a game with a difficulty level geared toward children using computers for the first time might be too easy. But Mega Cat and Playground decided to keep the game true to its original version, instead adding in Steam achievements for players who want an extra challenge.
“We very much believe in preservation,” Deighan said. “Our emphasis was more around, what can we do that allows that digital preservation to stand alone, while also having all these other replayability and collaborative features added in?”
Now, Backyard Baseball 1997 is available on Steam, but Mega Cat’s work isn’t done. With Playground Productions, they will also be remastering Backyard Soccer ’98, Backyard Football ’99, Backyard Basketball ’01, Backyard Baseball ’01, and Backyard Hockey ’02.
“The fans have been showing up like crazy,” Deighan said. “It’s easy to stay excited.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/13/data-center-tech-is-exploding-but-adoption-wont-be-easy-for-startups/,Data center tech is exploding but adoption won't be easy for startups | TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-10-13,"The data center industry is expanding rapidly to keep up with the flywheel growth of AI. While these data centers are necessary AI infrastructure, they store an AI company’s compute, they are expensive to build, seemingly more so to run, and they are a huge energy suck. Startups are looking to make data centers more efficient and sustainable, but it isn’t that simple.
The global data center market is estimated to be worth $301 billion, according to P&S Intelligence, and predicted to more than double into a $622.4 billion market by 2030. Data centers consume about 4% of the total power in the U.S. today, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, and it’s predicted to more than double to 9% by 2030.
Data centers, and the big companies that rely on them, are scrambling for power. Last month Microsoft inked a deal with Constellation Energy to restart its nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island to keep up with demand.
In tandem with the increase of data centers is the growth of the number of startups looking to solve the data center industry’s energy crisis and environmental impact. Startups like Incooling and Submer are looking to tackle the space by cooling down existing data center technology so they produce less heat. Others like Phaidra are using software to help data centers more efficiently manage their cooling.
Some are looking to build an entirely new model. Verrus is building a more “flexible” data center using microgrids. Sage Geosystems is building a way to use hot pressurized water to power data centers instead of natural gas.
Sophie Bakalar, a partner at Collab Fund, which is an investor in Phaidra, told TechCrunch that while there were entrepreneurs looking to build data center tech before the AI boom — data centers play a large role in cloud computing and bitcoin mining as well — she’s noticed a 10x increase in founders looking to build tech for this space over the last year.
“We’ve seen a company that is building data centers in space, it runs the whole gambit,” Bakalar said. “Whenever you have such an obvious problem in supply and demand, it’s natural you will see a lot of entrepreneurs eager to tackle the issue from different angles.”
But although data centers are expanding quickly and will need solutions to be more efficient, that doesn’t mean startups should think it will be easy to get their tech adopted.
Francis O’Sullivan, a managing director at S2G Ventures, told TechCrunch that the speed with which this space is growing may actually make it harder for startups to find partners willing to test their tech or take a chance on it.
“[Data centers] are enormously expensive assets, multibillion-dollar facilities. The reality there is they must work,” O’Sullivan said. “Therefore the real meaty data center world is not a forum for experimentation.”
The customer base for this kind of tech is also arguably more concentrated, and with that, likely harder to penetrate, said Kristian Branaes, a partner at climate-focused VC Transition. Branaes added that his firm has spent a lot of time researching and going deep into the data center tech category, but while they’ve found cool companies building novel tech, they haven’t been able to gain enough conviction to invest.
Branaes is worried about how companies will be able to scale. He thinks some of the startups he’s found fall under the classic climate tech conundrum of being cool tech but not necessarily a company that can produce venture-like returns. He said that it’s hard to build a venture-scale company that only sells into a handful of large companies like Microsoft and Apple.
“We have come to [the] view: It is very, very hard to build a large company only selling to AWS and Microsoft and whatever; they are ruthless at procurement,” Branaes said. “They are not in the business of giving away a lot of margins. If you start to make too much money, they want to circumvent that or start doing it internally.”
While some investors remain skeptical, many startups in this space are seeing traction. Impending regulations in both Europe and in data center-heavy U.S. states like Virginia mean that even if these large customers aren’t shopping for solutions now, they will likely have to in the future.
Helena Samodurova, the co-founder of Incooling, a Netherlands-based startup looking to cool data centers down, launched her company six years ago, before the current AI hype. While data centers, and the energy they used, was an issue then, the demand for Incooling’s tech has completely changed.
“Back in the day, people didn’t really know about it,” Samodurova said. “In the last six years, that has changed tremendously. As we went through this journey, we really had to educate people on what this was. Fast-forward six years later, that’s not the case. We are being sought out.”
Samodurova said interest has increased from both potential customers and investors, too. She added that the data center industry is more broad than just the Amazons and Googles of the world and that helping improve data center emissions is not just focused on those few large companies.
“You have a bus to go to the station, you have a car to take your family to go out, you have a Ferrari to go racing, everything has four wheels but the mechanics of it is different,” Samodurova said. “We provide cooling solutions or computing solutions to fix whatever bottleneck you are.”
O’Sullivan said that for him, while a lot of data center tech is a bit too nascent to get excited about at the moment, there are other categories of companies to back that help solve some of the same issues data center tech is aiming for. One is: solving the issues involved with getting the actual energy to the data center and making sure that power grids can handle that level of power.
For startups focused on data centers, adoption might just be too early for some of the category’s earliest entrants. Unlike Incooling, many companies have just been founded in the past few years. While the data center tech market may be in its earliest innings, AI, and the data centers needed to power the industry, aren’t going away anytime soon.
“I think the main point to consider is there is a real urgency here,” Bakalar said. “The growth is really outpacing the current infrastructure that we have. We need newer, better, faster ways to achieve the promise we have heard about AI.”

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/13/meet-the-chinese-typhoon-hackers-preparing-for-war/,Meet the Chinese 'Typhoon' hackers preparing for war | TechCrunch,Carly Page,2024-10-13,"Of the cybersecurity risks facing the United States today, few loom larger than the potential sabotage capabilities posed by China-backed hackers, which top U.S. officials have described as an “epoch-defining threat.”
In recent months, U.S. intelligence officials said Chinese government-backed hackers have been burrowing deep into the networks of U.S. critical infrastructure, including water, energy, and transportation providers. The goal, officials say, is to lay the groundwork for potentially destructive cyberattacks in the event of a future conflict between China and the U.S., such as over a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan.
“China’s hackers are positioning on American infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities, if or when China decides the time has come to strike,” FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers earlier this year.
The U.S. government and its allies have since taken action against the “Typhoon” family of Chinese hacking groups, and published new details about the threats they pose.
In January, the U.S. disrupted “Volt Typhoon,” a group of Chinese government hackers tasked with setting the stage for destructive cyberattacks. Later in September, the feds hijacked a botnet run by another Chinese hacking group called “Flax Typhoon,” which masquerades as a private company in Beijing and whose role was to help conceal the activities of China’s government hackers. Since then, a new China-backed hacking group called “Salt Typhoon” emerged, capable of gathering intelligence on Americans — and potential targets of U.S. surveillance — by compromising the wiretap systems of U.S. phone and internet providers.
Here’s what we know so far about the Chinese hacking groups gearing up for war.
Volt Typhoon represents a new breed of China-backed hacking groups; no longer just aimed at stealing sensitive U.S. secrets, but rather preparing to disrupt the U.S. military’s “ability to mobilize,” according to the FBI’s director.
Microsoft first identified Volt Typhoon in May 2023, finding that the hackers had targeted and compromised network equipment, such as routers, firewalls, and VPNs, since mid-2021 as part of an ongoing and concerted effort to infiltrate deeper into U.S. critical infrastructure. In reality, it’s likely the hackers were operating for much longer; potentially for as long as five years.
Volt Typhoon compromised thousands of internet-connected devices in the months following Microsoft’s report, exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-connected devices that were considered “end-of-life” and as such would no longer receive security updates. As such, the hacking group subsequently managed to compromise the IT environments of multiple critical infrastructure sectors, including aviation, water, energy, and transportation, pre-positioning itself for activating future would-be disruptive cyberattacks.
“This actor is not doing the quiet intelligence collection and theft of secrets that has been the norm in the U.S. They are probing sensitive critical infrastructure so they can disrupt major services if, and when, the order comes down,” said John Hultquist, chief analyst at security firm Mandiant.
The U.S. government said in January that it had successfully disrupted a botnet, used by Volt Typhoon, consisting of thousands of hijacked U.S.-based small office and home network routers, which the Chinese hacking group used to hide its malicious activity aimed at targeting U.S. critical infrastructure. The FBI said it was able to remove the malware from the hijacked routers, severing the Chinese hacking group’s connection to the botnet.
Flax Typhoon, first outed in an August 2023 report from Microsoft, is another China-backed hacking group that officials say has operated under the guise of a publicly traded cybersecurity company based in Beijing. The company, Integrity Technology Group, has publicly acknowledged its connections to China’s government, according to U.S. officials.
In September, the U.S. government said it had taken control of another botnet, used by Flax Typhoon, which leveraged a custom variant of the infamous Mirai malware, made up of hundreds of thousands of internet-connected devices.
U.S. officials said at the time that the Flax Typhoon-controlled botnet was used to “conduct malicious cyber activity disguised as routine internet traffic from the infected consumer devices.” Prosecutors said the botnet run by Flax Typhoon allowed other China government-backed hackers to “hack into networks in the U.S. and around the world to steal information and hold our infrastructure at risk.”
According to Microsoft’s profile of the government-backed group, Flax Typhoon has been active since mid-2021, predominantly targeting “government agencies and education, critical manufacturing, and information technology organizations in Taiwan.” The Department of Justice said it corroborated Microsoft’s findings and that Flax Typhoon also “attacked multiple U.S. and foreign corporations.”
The latest — and potentially most ominous — group in China’s government-backed cyber army uncovered in recent months is Salt Typhoon.
Salt Typhoon hit headlines in October for a much more sophisticated operation. As first reported by The Wall Street Journal, the China-linked hacking group is believed to have compromised the wiretap systems of several U.S. telecom and internet providers, including AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink), and Verizon.
According to one report, Salt Typhoon may have gained access to these organizations using compromised Cisco routers. The U.S. government is said to be in the early stages of its investigation.
While the scale of the internet provider compromises remains unknown, the Journal, citing national security sources, said the breach could be “potentially catastrophic.” By hacking into systems that law enforcement agencies use for court-authorized collection of customer data, Salt Typhoon potentially gained access to data and systems that house much of the U.S. government’s requests — including the potential identities of Chinese targets of U.S. surveillance.
It’s not yet known when the breach occurred, but WSJ reports that the hackers may have held access to the internet providers’ wiretap systems “for months or longer.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/13/this-three-person-robotics-startup-is-working-with-designer-yves-behar-to-bring-humanoids-home/,This three-person robotics startup is working with designer Yves Béhar to bring humanoids home | TechCrunch,Brian Heater,2024-10-13,"It’s hard to know where to focus when speaking to Christoph Kohstall. The contents of his packed Palo Alto garage compete for attention. To his immediate right stands a tower of electrical components, dotted with flashing lights. To his left is a workbench and the tops of machining tools.
A red industrial girder runs along the ceiling above. For those who’ve spent time in robotics labs, the element is immediately identifiable as a gantry system, used to stabilize robots during the testing phase.
Indeed, at its far end, the top of a robot head is barely visible, peeking over Kohstall’s shoulder as he logs into the meeting. I inquire as to whether the ceiling-mounted system is being used to test his system’s bipedal robot. He answers in the affirmative, before adding that the team has moved on to another, less conventional system: an $80 coat rack.
One thing you can say for certain peering into Kind Humanoid’s chaotic workspace: The spirit of Silicon Valley’s dormant home-brew computing scene may have been mostly priced out, but it isn’t altogether dead.
Videos posted by the robotics startup are infused with the same charm. Kind’s earliest Mona prototypes appear Frankensteined together, like a prop from an ’80s movie about two kids building a robot for the science fair.
It’s hard to know what to make of it all at first glance. Kohstall has a Silicon Valley pedigree that would seem to bely the chaotic scene, including, most recently, a year spent working on robotics as part of the now-defunct Google Brain team.
Kind Humanoid’s three-person team recently gained a champion in Yves Béhar. The highly sought-after designer says he first visited Kohstall’s garage in late 2022/early 2023.
“I was immediately fascinated by two things,” he says. “One: To literally see robots emerge out of a small laboratory, to see body parts come out of the 3D printer, and to see motors and actuators and these elements be fitted inside of those parts. The other was a sense of efficiency and speed that I found really exciting.”
Earlier this month, Kind showcased Béhar’s renderings for a humanoid robot. It’s an alien mix of angles and shapes that are every bit as whimsical as the home-brewed robot underneath. The robot is clad in a soft white, with rounded edges to match. It’s as though someone was challenged to construct a human-shaped figure from a collaborative industrial arm.
The robot’s end effectors are recognizable as an analogue to human hands. Its feet, however, are more hoof-like. On closer inspection, they appear to be a pair of actuated joints stabilizing the bipedal bot. A diamond-shaped head is mounted atop an impossibly skinny neck. Adding to the render’s dreamlike quality, a small visor-like screen displays a cloudy blue sky.
It’s surreal by design. Béhar borrowed aesthetic cues from Belgian painter René Magritte.
“We use these background images of clouds to start to find ways that we can communicate the robot’s intent, or what it’s going through at the moment. Is it thinking? Is it reflecting? Is it going to give me an interesting or funny answer? This is why a face is important. The way it orients itself gives you a sense of intent and connection.”
The team intentionally avoided making a robot that looks too human, to avoid being tripped up by the uncanny valley effect. The system also offers a marked contrast from the stark, stormtrooper design employed by the likes of Tesla and Figure. In this sense, form follows function. Kind envisions Mona as a home caretaker.
Most humanoid manufacturers are targeting the industrial setting first, with eventual plans to bring the technology into a home setting. There are a number of reasons for this, with many boiling down to simple economics. Carmakers tend to have deeper pockets than caretakers. Corporations can invest these technologies to help them scale toward mass production.
It’s precisely because other humanoid manufacturers aren’t tackling the home in the near term that Kind’s three-person team is investing its efforts here. “We do not intend to compete in the industrial market, because it is very crowded,” Kohstall says. “Ironically, the argument to build a humanoid is not the strongest in the industrial market. The industrial market is pretty well served in many ways by specialized robots. The humanoid becomes so beautifully potent in a setting where [there’s] diverse locomotion across stairs and cluttered environments.”
Initial customers could include care facilities and homes for older adults looking to maintain independence. Aging in place is a largely untapped market for advanced robotics; most commercial work is focused on bringing humanoids to warehouses and factory floors.
All of this feels almost impossibly far off. Perhaps it’s Kind’s indifference to fundraising, a passive act of defiance as alien to Silicon Valley as rent protection.
“Our team is focused on the innovation part,” Kohstall says, “and that’s not something you just solve by throwing money at it. That just requires experimentation, being capital efficient, and thoughtful.”
He adds that Kind is working on building an initial dozen Mona robots, destined for field tests early next year. It’s a statement that seems every bit as surreal as Béhar’s product design. I gesture to the robot behind Kohstall, noting that there’s still a tremendous amount of daylight between the DIY frankenbots on display in early videos and the Magritte-inspired renders.
He notes that the sinewy robots that frequent Kind’s videos are the first prototype. He moves the conference call outside, where pieces of the robot are being spray-painted on the ground. These form the robot’s outer shell, bringing the design more in line with the one Béhar dreamed up.
“Most parts are injection moldable,” says Kohstall. “So it can be mass manufactured and built cheaply.”"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/13/how-a-medtech-market-opportunity-is-shaping-up-for-wearable-neurotech/,How a medtech market opportunity is shaping up for wearable neurotech | TechCrunch,Natasha Lomas,2024-10-13,"When you think of brain-stimulating medtech, startups building wearables as therapeutics probably aren’t the first thing that springs to mind. Such tech is still flying fairly under the radar — perhaps, in part, because these sorts of companies have raised a fraction of the investment that’s been ploughed into invasive technologies for targeting treatments at the human brain.
Elon Musk’s brain implant startup Neuralink is probably the most well known of the invasive plays — raising at least $323 million since 2016 in a bid to get brain-computer interfaces to market as a treatment for people with neurological disorders or neurodegenerative diseases.
Given the far higher risks involved in embedding hardware inside the soft tissues of the brain it’s hardly surprising development is costly and time-consuming. But this is also why non-invasive neurotech — while less well known and more experimental than established — is an attractive prospect for investors willing to take a punt.
Simply put, it’s a lot cheaper to zap a person’s head from the outside than to stick technology inside the brain. Development of therapeutics also looks much more cost efficient than drug discovery.
“The opportunity is massive at the moment,” argues Kerry Baldwin, co-founder of U.K.-based deep-tech investor IQ Capital, which has backed a Belfast-based neurotech startup called Neurovalens at the seed (2019) and Series A (2020) stages.
This medtech startup, which was founded back in 2013, has raised a total of $30.4 million to date to fund development of its wearable brain-stimulating technologies targeting a range of mental health and metabolic conditions. It has said it’s aiming to close a Series B by the end of the year, too — which could add another $40 million to that pot.
But the amounts involved — still in the tens of millions — look modest compared to the costs of commercializing invasive neurotech. Or the billions that can be required to develop new pharmaceuticals. Which explains why Baldwin is so bullish on neurotech, dubbing it “a great place to invest.”
The scope of the market opportunity is another angle here that’s exciting investors. There are many potential therapeutic applications for neurotech wearables — with depression just one of multiple conditions and diseases where device makers claim they can make a difference.
Neurovalens illustrates how extensively the tech could range in healthcare as it’s developing a whole portfolio of electrical (TES) neurostimulating wearables. The startup was set up off the back of research by founder Dr. Jason McKeown, who was looking into applying brain stimulation to the vestibular nerve (which is located behind the ear) as a route to reach the brainstem, a key control center for fundamental bodily processes.
His team started with a prototype neurotech wearable focused on a weight loss use case but has since expanded and refined their target applications to encompass the following five+ conditions: Chronic insomnia; GAD (generalized anxiety disorder); PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder); Type II diabetes; obesity; and — also potentially, depending on the outcome of a current clinical trial — depression.
The startup has had two wearables approved by the FDA so far: A device to treat chronic insomnia, called the Modius Sleep; and a wearable for GAD, aka the Modius Stress.
It’s also running U.S. clinical trials for separate wearables targeting PTSD and Type II diabetes — and the startup hopes to turn all these efforts into a pipeline of approvals over the next two years (including another neurotech device that’s focused on treating obesity risk and promoting weight loss by targeting biological mechanisms that store visceral fat).
Baldwin tells TechCrunch the deep tech fund was attracted to Neurovalens by “the sheer breadth of where this technology could be applied.”
“In terms of how you can get to market in massive [healthcare] markets, once you’re through all the clearance regulations… you can do this quite effectively,” she explains, saying the relatively small capital outlay required to get to that point “made sense” for a deep tech, early-stage investor.
She’s also upbeat about where the neurotech market is headed — pointing to projections that brain-targeting medtech is poised for major growth over the next five years.
Currently, the market as a whole — factoring in both invasive and non-invasive neurotech — is worth around $13 billion-$14 billion, per Baldwin, but she flags forecasts predicting this will rise to $40 billion by 2030.
How much of that growing pie ends up going to invasive neurotech startups versus wearables remains to be seen. But it seems a fair bet that non-invasive approaches have a good chance of gaining ground quickly — since, once they have the necessary approvals, their kit can be prescribed earlier, thereby potentially reaching more patients.
When IQ was first considering a neurotech investment, Baldwin recounts how McKeown — who was a neuroscience professor at San Diego University at the time — had been exploring neurostimulation as a treatment for obesity.
“We’re stimulating the same area in the brain that controls how your body manages energy,” he explains, saying the startup has been able to show “really significant” reductions in visceral fat, i.e. fat that’s stored around organs, elevating a person’s health risks.
“One of the joys of being a deep tech investor is just sitting down with your founders and saying, yeah, what if?” Baldwin continues. “That was what was so particularly attractive to Neurovalens; that they were able to apply their technology to several massive, globally important themes, rather than just have to drill down into one.”
IQ opted to make its neurotech investment in a startup developing wearable medtech, rather than something more invasive like brain implants — but Baldwin stresses they were looking at “bold treatments.” Evidently, though, the complexity and cost involved in commercializing implanted neurotech tipped the scales in favor of a head-mounted route in.
“When you go invasive it’s a whole different level of complexity,” she emphasizes. “In terms of regulatory, the cash required to get there, the kind of team support you need — from not only the medical profession but also the regulatory profession. It’s a very different investment.”
What about market opportunity? Given how many conditions and diseases medtech neurotech builders are eyeing this could end up scaling considerably, too, in the coming years.
According to the CDC, the percentage of people in the U.S. aged 18 and above who report having “regular feelings of depression” stands at 5%. And data from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics for 2015 to 2018 found that 13.2% of U.S. adults had used antidepressant medications over the past 30 days — with rates of medication for depression trending upwards since its last survey.
Anxiety is another target area for non-invasive neurotech — and the CDC records U.S. adults experiencing regular feelings of “worry, nervousness, or anxiety” as even greater: 12.5%.
Turning to sleep disorders, between 30%-40%+ of U.S. adults report getting insufficient sleep. Although rates of chronic insomnia specifically are lower: A recent survey commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that 12% of U.S. adults had been diagnosed with this more disruptive sleep disorder.
Diabetes is another major problem, in the U.S. and globally — one which can have very serious health consequences. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 38 million Americans have diabetes — around 1 in 10 of the population — and between 90% to 95% of those have Type II diabetes, aka the kind Neurovalens hopes to be able to treat with its neurotech wearable.
Obesity, which can lead to a person developing diabetes, is even more prevalent — with more than 2 in 5 adult Americans being obese, per the CDC.
Another of Neurovalens’ target conditions — PTSD — is a lot rarer. But the National Center for PTSD, a division of the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, has suggested about six in every 100 people will experience it at some point in their lives. And while there’s a strong association between PTSD and military service, McKeown highlights that a particularly high risk group are middle aged women who have suffered from domestic abuse.
He says the startup is particularly excited about the PTSD wearable in development as the condition is notoriously difficult to treat. “PTSD doesn’t respond very well to drugs — there are no really approved treatments. So we might be the first treatment available,” he suggests.
When its PTSD trial wraps up, giving them a chance to fully review the data, he says they may seek to submit that wearable under the FDA’s Breakthrough Devices Program which can speed up the process of U.S. regulatory review. So McKeown says they’re hopeful this medtech product — slated to be called Modius Spiro — could be approved as soon as next year.
Closer in line for clearance is Neurovalens’ obesity device (aka the Modius Lean) — which they’ve been trialing for longer. McKeown says they’re anticipating approval for that either later this year or early next. The aforementioned diabetes device (Modius DM) is further out — but he says they hope to have FDA approval for it in 2026.
Neurovalens is also considering commercializing a wearable for depression — which, if it goes ahead, would be called the Modius Mood — but the startup has yet to decide on whether to take that forward.
While the commercialization of these higher risk category treatments must wait for a green light from the FDA before they can proceed, the medtech company does have two products approved already (for chronic insomnia and GAD). These therapeutic wearables will be launching in the U.S. in the next few months so it will be switching into active marketing soon.
These first, lower-risk neurotech products offer a chance for Neurovalens to test how much appetite there is for wearable neurotech in healthcare.
Despite being based in and developing out of Europe, its go-to-market strategy has always been focused on going to the U.S. first. McKeown says the FDA represents the “gold standard” for medical device approval. It’s also a required step to access the country’s massive healthcare market.
While there’s no guarantee the FDA will approve any of the startup’s more novel (and higher risk category) treatments, McKeown is convinced the market opportunity it’s been working toward for so long is poised for lift-off.
“There’s so much research being carried out — even [implanted] devices are now slowly making their way through to get reimbursement in the U.S., under the Medicare or the private healthcare payers. So the opportunity in general is just really exploding.”
He argues this is even more true of the non-invasive sector — pointing out these types of devices sit “quite close” to the consumer health category, where neurotech kit makers are bringing more devices to market that make (unregulated) wellness claims. “Although our devices are prescribed, they’re prescribed at the really earliest stages,” he emphasizes.
“An implanted device for, say, anxiety or a mental health issue is a last resort,” he adds, whereas neurotech wearables — being totally non-invasive — have the potential to achieve much greater scale and patient impact.
Still, even with close to a decade of development work clocked up by some neurotech startups the challenges of commercializing head-mounted brain-stimulators undoubtedly makes for a long list.
Discussing hurdles Neurovalens has had to negotiate to get this far McKeown talks unbroken for several minutes.
His list includes taking theoretical lab work and presenting it to investors to convince them to cut a check and take a bet it can be translated into clinically validated outcomes; convincing doctors to involved their patients in trials for novel and experimental treatments; and conducting clinical trials to amass data to make a convincing case for medical device regulators to approve novel treatments.
“We just focus on making patients better. So the challenge… is showing to the FDA how well we can do this, and [that] the safety profile and the risk profile is proportionate to that,” he explains.
“And then the challenge after that is, well, how do you start selling it?”
Assuming an FDA green light, medtech players also need to tackle the issue of reimbursement — convincing healthcare payers the treatment represents value for money — if they want to get their kit into the hands of patients at major scale. And, if that goes well, they arrive at the next challenge: patient education.
For neurotech, this means getting people to look beyond what are still rather whacky optics (brain zapping headbands) and see a wearable device as a viable treatment for, say, a mental health issue alongside more established choices like therapy and medication.
There’s a further wrinkle where patients are concerned, too, as a positive outcome from neurostimulation as a treatment is not guaranteed.
As is often the case with all sorts of medical treatments, patient outcomes can vary. But there’s perhaps a particular incongruity if a gadget is not doing what it’s supposed to given consumers are so accustomed to having high-tech utility on tap, thanks to the rise of smartphones or even consumer wearables.
Flow Neuroscience, the Swedish medtech we met in the first part of this series, has had to devise a strategy to tackle the challenge of variable efficacy.
It’s chosen to commercialize an electrical form of neurostimulation known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for its first product, which is a depression-treating wearable. However co-founder and CTO Erik Rehn accepts tDCS may not work for every person — but he’s quick to point out that antidepressants and other drugs have the same issue: “With some people it works great, with others not.”
“The reality of it is that people’s brains are different, and also people’s depression. Depression as a diagnosis is very heterogeneous,” he tells TechCrunch. “It’s a big problem, of course, but we’re kind of stuck with the terminology… that’s what treatments are approved for.”
Medtech builders have two options, in Rehn’s view. One: taking a “precision medicine” pathway that narrows and optimizes targeting — but also requires “advanced equipment” and techniques that may crimp accessibility and raise costs. Two: “Make something that’s cheap and available to everyone, but it might not work for everyone — but everyone can try it.” The second route is what Flow opted for.
This strategy shoots for greater scale, and in doing so — the idea is — there’s a better chance of finding those patients who will respond well to the treatment. Crudely put, it could be described as spray and pray. (Or perhaps scale to prevail.) And, along the way, there will be some patients for whom the wearable therapeutic works as hoped and some who will be disappointed.
Rehn admits it would be “very interesting” to better understand and predict patient outcomes — and he says Flow has done research exploring why tDCS helps some people but not others. But moving too far in that direction this would shift the startup’s strategy closer to the “precision medicine” approach he believes is too restrictive to build traction and scale.
How to maximize efficacy while also keeping neurotech cheap and convenient to use — while also building a viable business that can deliver returns to investors — is, he suggests, “an open question.”
It’s striking how different Neurovalens’ approach is to this neurotech challenge of uncertain outcomes. It’s opted for an R&D intensive strategy that has enabled it to develop a range of devices during a pre-market phase, each aimed at distinct and precisely defined conditions (and, therefore, patients).
“We really want to have a well defined patient that has the very specific disease that we treat,” emphasizes McKeown.
This portfolio play allows the startup to tweak the neurostimulation dosage for each patient segment — a degree of targeting that should help it to mitigate uncertain outcomes. (So, for example, its wearable for treating anxiety is not just for anyone suffering anxiety but for the specific condition generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); similarly its insomnia device is not for any sleep disorder, just “chronic insomnia”).
It’s fair to say this is not the typical startup approach as it involves years of preparatory way-paving before a budding business is even able to introduce its first products — whereas Flow’s B2C (and, later, it hopes B2B) route looks more a more familiar startup playbook.
Having multiple medtech products in development simultaneously obviously ramps up costs and demands on the team. It also requires a decent funding cushion to support years of R&D before the business is in a position to pull in meaningful revenue from device sales. This explains why Neurovalens has raised so much more (around 3x) investor cash versus Flow (the Swedish startup had raised a total of just over $11 million back in 2021 when it bagged its $9 million Series A so appears to have taken a far leaner approach to funding).
“We have been doing R&D for a long, long time,” McKeown admits. “It feels like forever.”
How has the startup stuck at it for so long? “We were quite reserved in our milestones,” he responds. “Every big milestone we hit ahead of time and ahead of budget gives investors confidence to keep reinvesting and to get to the next milestone.” Whereas, he suggests, an excess of ambition can lead to investors jumping ship when unrealistic expectations are not met.
Neurovalens getting its first couple of FDA approvals — the first was for the insomnia wearable in fall last year — was a major credibility milestone, he adds. “Now that we have got our first two approvals then there’s really no doubt in the investor’s mind that we can do this.”
Even with carefully curated patient segments, it’s clear Neurovalens’ neurostimulation won’t work for every brain it’s applied to. And, as we noted above, that’s a particularly interesting challenge for a hardware startup to grapple with. Patients have learned to expect patchy results from popping pills, but when it comes to consumer tech expectations can be a lot more demanding of insta results.
“People assume that it’s a bit like an iPhone — that technology just works for everyone,” McKeown observes, yet ‘it just works’ is not the case with neurotech. “There’s a bit of an education piece.”
One future hope for further reducing variable outcomes from non-invasive neurostimulation is if device makers can find ways to better personalize the treatment per patient. But that’s something else startups in this space will have to scratch their heads over in the coming years."

LeCun — a professor at New York University, senior researcher at Meta, and winner of the prestigious A.M. Turing Award — has been open about his skepticism before, for example tweeting that before we worry about controlling super-intelligent AI, “we need to have the beginning of a hint of a design for a system smarter than a house cat.”
He elaborated on his opinions in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, where he replied to a question about AI becoming smart enough to pose a threat to humanity by saying, “You’re going to have to pardon my French, but that’s complete B.S.”
LeCun argued that today’s large language models lack some key cat-level capabilities, like persistent memory, reasoning, planning, and an understanding of the physical world. In his view, LLMs merely demonstrate that “you can manipulate language and not be smart,” and they will never lead to true artificial general intelligence (AGI).
It’s not that he’s a complete AGI skeptic. However, he said new approaches will be needed. For example, he pointed to work around digesting real-world video by his Fundamental AI Research team at Meta.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/12/in-latest-move-against-wp-engine-wordpress-takes-control-of-acf-plugin/,"In latest move against WP Engine, WordPress takes control of ACF plug-in | TechCrunch",Anthony Ha,2024-10-12,"The dispute between WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg and hosting provider WP Engine continues, with Mullenweg announcing that WordPress is “forking” a plug-in developed by WP Engine.
Specifically, Advanced Custom Fields — a plug-in making it easier for WordPress users to customize their edit screens — is being taken out of WP Engine’s hands and updated as a new plug-in called Secure Custom Fields.
Mullenweg wrote that this step was necessary “to remove commercial upsells and fix a security problem.”
The Advanced Custom Fields team responded on X, describing this as a situation where a plug-in “under active development” has been “unilaterally and forcibly taken away from its creator without consent,” which it said has never happened “in the 21 year history of WordPress.”
“This essential community promise has been violated, and we ask everyone to consider the ethics of such an action, and the new precedent that has been set,” the ACF team wrote.
Both Mullenweg’s blog post and a reply from WordPress claim that similar situations have, in fact, happened before, though Mullenweg added, “This is a rare and unusual situation brought on by WP Engine’s legal attacks, we do not anticipate this happening for other plugins.”
They also pointed to WordPress’ plug-in guidelines, which give WordPress the right to disable or remove any plug-in, remove developer access, or change a plug-in “without developer consent, in the name of public safety.”
Early Monday, after the initial announcement, WordPress offered more information about its security concerns, concluding, “[ACF’s] code is currently insecure, and it is a dereliction of their duty to customers for them to tell people to avoid Secure Custom Fields until they fix their vulnerability.”
Some background: WordPress is a free, open source content management system used by many websites (including TechCrunch), while companies like WP Engine and Mullenweg’s Automattic offer hosting and other commercial services on top.
Last month, Mullenweg published a blog post criticizing WP Engine as a “cancer to WordPress.” His criticisms covered everything from WP Engine’s lack of support for revision history to its investor Silver Lake, but he also suggested that its “WP” branding confuses customers, making it sound like the company is officially connected to WordPress.
Cease-and-desist letters have gone both ways, with WP Engine claiming Mullenweg threatened to take a “scorched earth nuclear approach” unless the company paid to license the WordPress trademark.
WordPress banned WP Engine from accessing WordPress.org, briefly lifted the ban, then imposed it again. This essentially prevents WP Engine from updating the plug-in through WordPress.org — so it can’t offer automatic updates to address security issues.
WP Engine has, however, published a workaround for users who want to update the plug-in and continue using ACF. (It says the workaround is only necessary for ACF’s free users, as pro users will continue to receive updates through the ACF website.)
Moving forward, Mullenweg wrote that Secure Custom Fields will be available as a non-commercial plug-in: “If any developers want to get involved in maintaining and improving it, please get in touch.”
This post has been updated to include more information from WordPress."

This week, we’re taking a closer look at Tesla’s Cybercab and Robovan reveals, the “complete disarray” at Fisker HQ, and a horrifying side effect of living in our modern world: AI summaries of your breakup texts. Let’s do this.
Tesla finally revealed its Cybercab robotaxi. Unveiled at the company’s We, Robot event, the Cybercab looks like a smaller, sleeker, two-seater Cybertruck — and the company claims it’ll cost less than $30,000. In a surprise reveal, Elon Musk also unveiled a prototype of Tesla’s Robovan: An electric, autonomous vehicle roughly the size of a bus, designed for transporting people around high-density areas.
Fidelity Investments confirmed that over 77,000 customers had personal information compromised during an August data breach, including Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses. The investment firm said in a filing with Maine’s attorney general that an unnamed third party accessed information “using two customer accounts that they had recently established.”
Babbel CEO Arne Schepker is stepping down, and the company’s co-founder and former CEO, Markus Witte, is stepping back in to lead Babbel “into a new phase” as they search for Schepker’s successor. This new phase for the popular Berlin-based language learning platform, unsurprisingly, will involve AI.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/12/tiktoks-research-reportedly-acknowledges-negative-effects-on-teens/,TikTok’s research reportedly acknowledges negative effects on teens | TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,2024-10-12,"Court documents suggest that TikTok executives are aware of the app’s potential harm to teenagers, according to reporting by NPR and Kentucky Public Radio.
Fourteen U.S. attorneys general sued TikTok earlier this week, claiming that the app harms children’s mental health. Much of the material in those suits was redacted, but reporters were able to read some of that material by copy-pasting.
According to Kentucky’s lawsuit, the company’s own research shows that “compulsive usage correlates with a slew of negative mental health effects like loss of analytical skills, memory formation, contextual thinking, conversational depth, empathy, and increased anxiety.”
In addition, the suit includes internal communication around a feature allowing parents to limit their children’s TikTok usage — apparently the feature only reduced usage by an average of 1.5 minutes per day, with the company instead measuring its success based on “improving public trust in the TikTok platform via media coverage.”
A TikTok spokesperson said it was “highly irresponsible” for NPR to publish excerpts from the lawsuit, which he claimed “cherry-picks misleading quotes and takes outdated documents out of context to misrepresent our commitment to community safety.”"
